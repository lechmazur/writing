  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation through accumulative pressure works well - from examining debris to discovering the chrysalis to presenting findings. The dominant stake (understanding decay as language vs. event) deepens through concrete discoveries. Cost becomes visible in professional isolation, though the personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from physical survival to existential purpose, with the frost-reading discovery narrowing Lirael's options toward a specific artistic path. The cost appears in abandoning traditional glasswork for ephemeral teaching, though the smuggler threat never resurfaces to test her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving silence can be expressive—develops through escalating experiments from solo work to Elias's arrival to the mother's lullaby breakthrough. Cost is visible in Lirael's trembling hands and months of isolation. Some middle passages could tighten the pressure between attempts, but the accumulation toward the concert hall performances lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving the city's distress signals—escalates through Elias's growing investment in the repair work, with his stubbornness creating authentic resistance. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as density increases through the lens repair sequence. However, the middle section lacks a sharp reversal or tightening moment that would elevate the escalation beyond steady progression.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—survival versus solidarity—is clear, with one meaningful turn when donations cease but are replaced by open exchange. However, the conflict lacks visceral pressure; we're told about dwindling supplies but don't feel the hunger. The cost of Mira's choice manifests but remains somewhat abstract—no specific hardship shown after donations stop.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—progresses through Lira following a light trail to the pool, but this journey lacks meaningful resistance or deepening pressure. The single drop of Kwan Yin's Tear transforms perception without extracting visible cost or forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.1)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through intensifying visions and the garden's physical responses. The disintegration sequence provides escalation, but agency becomes muddy—is Elara controlling events or merely experiencing them? The resolution feels more like discovery than earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from patient waiting to active puzzle-solving to confrontation with scavengers, with Lirael's chains as persistent constraint. The seeds' instant growth provides visible resolution with cost. However, the scavengers arrive too conveniently and their threat could be more specifically dramatized rather than summarized as "faces twisted with greed."

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: collecting absence-memories, adding the peach tree root causing the mixture to erupt, then forging the device that amplifies betrayal's frequency. The cost manifests in Lira clutching her ears from "exhilarating" pain and the final realization of absence "where love should be," though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from simple theft to existential exchange when the jar demands "something of equal weight," forcing Elara to risk her most precious stolen memory. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as symbolic elements (lily, starlight, photograph) build toward the transformative trade. The wilted lily provides visible cost, though emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—creating "safe zones for inquiry"—faces minimal active opposition beyond the abstract threat of a frozen/thawing world. While the discovery of schematics provides a turn, escalation remains gentle rather than pressurized, with Kael's internal journey proceeding without significant external obstacles or meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal identity crisis to physical danger to generational reconciliation, with the enforcer confrontation providing genuine pressure. Lila's agency drives the resolution through decrypting, confronting, and outwitting. The cost of inherited enemies and confronting her mother's betrayal registers, though the mob boss arrest happens too conveniently off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation follows accumulative logic as each silence type deepens the map's complexity—from wave-pause to thunderclap-hush to breath-held stillness. The dominant stake (completing the map before the last star vanishes) creates genuine time pressure. Cost manifests in aching fingers, the fort's darkness, and accepting navigation by absence rather than light.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (finding where thoughts come from) is clear and escalates through the violin discovery and temporal journey, but lacks genuine resistance or cost. The transformation happens too smoothly without meaningful obstacles, and the "test" revelation feels retroactively imposed rather than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from counting stubs to decoding messages to accepting a new role. The dominant stake (understanding hidden communication) tightens when Lira reveals tickets as "keys to conversations left unfinished." However, the resolution lacks visceral cost—Elias's acceptance feels too smooth, missing internal resistance that would heighten the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake (proving human touch matters) is signaled early but pressure remains static—Elara demonstrates her methods to Joren without escalating cost or narrowing options. The maze's "shifting paths" are mentioned but never create active obstacles; the sensor-blocking demonstration lacks urgency or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from calibration to crisis when the nexus destabilizes, forcing urgent recalibration. The tightening narrows options—Veyra must act immediately or lose control—but resolution comes too easily through technical adjustment. Cost remains abstract ("glimpse the unseen") rather than showing what Veyra sacrifices or risks beyond momentary danger.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation occurs through pattern accumulation - symbols emerge, match her sheet music, form the symphony's opening bars. The stakes deepen from curiosity to commitment. However, the ghost's agency overshadows Clara's until the final promise; more active discovery would strengthen this.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from internal uncertainty through discovering the quarantine folder to the decisive departure. The dominant stake—whether to maintain oracle certainty or embrace margin-dwelling truth—tightens effectively. Cost is visible in leaving her position and the director's coming rage, though middle pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates from curiosity through mechanical warnings ("You shouldn't have come") to the hologram's revelation of mass death and cover-up, with Elias's agency driving each turn through his choice to turn the valve. The stakes sharpen from documenting decay to confronting moral failure, though the ghost's convenient cooperation slightly reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through each fold of the origami map, with the keeper shedding "another layer of self" at the black pool—a meaningful tightening that narrows options. The cost is legible when they must "let go" of their chronicling purpose to achieve silence, though the return journey could strengthen the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    The eclipse provides natural escalation as darkness deepens stakes around belief versus skepticism. Mara's transformation from "It's just hair" to "I'll keep it...For when I forget" shows genuine cost in abandoning her defensive stance, though the conflict resolution feels somewhat smooth without deeper resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through discoveries that deepen understanding: Clara's diaries reveal the ritual, the tapestry contains hidden language, symbols match diary entries. The stakes shift from documenting to recognizing ignored stories, with the cost manifesting as humanity's collective failure to listen. The final acknowledgment carries weight, though the supernatural resolution slightly reduces earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to world-changing responsibility as Elara discovers her fortunes are "keys" in a larger design. The dominant stake - whether to continue her father's work - tightens when she realizes she's already been unconsciously participating, though the immediate cost of her choice remains unclear.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulating loop layers that destabilize the anchor—from flickering lights to rippling surface to final disintegration. The priest's agency drives each intensification through deliberate rhetorical devices. Missing higher bands because the cost remains primarily conceptual ("dimensions in flux") rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing ephemeral memory through cryptic fortunes before exhaustion hits—intensifies as dawn progresses and time pressure mounts. The escalation follows the textural lens as Lirael's writing accelerates from single fortunes to creating "symphonies" from moments. The cost is legible: she sacrifices conventional fortune-telling for memory preservation, accepting that customers will receive "maps" rather than predictions.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—finding her place in chaos—is signaled early but escalation feels predetermined rather than pressured. Mara's choice between timeline paths lacks genuine cost since she can apparently traverse multiple versions. The power "ebbing" creates mild urgency but doesn't meaningfully constrain her exploration.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (defeating numbness) signals early and deepens through the reversed-music experiment that "frays" her numbness. However, escalation feels gentle rather than pressured—Elias provides solutions without resistance, and the transformation occurs without significant obstacles. The cost (months of numbness) is mostly retrospective rather than dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to public health crisis to moral imperative, with the recorder's alarm marking each threshold. The dominant stake (documenting truth versus safety) tightens when Elias enters the zone despite "Biohazard detected. Level: Critical." Cost becomes tangible through exposure risk and the woman's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on understanding the source of grief, with pressure building through Lirael's decision to risk the ultraviolet method despite being "aromatically cautious." The vision sequence deepens rather than reverses, showing the woman's joy-to-loss arc that mirrors Lirael's inherited sorrow. Cost manifests through "hot and sudden" tears and the acceptance of grief as "proof that she was alive."

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through the being's challenge ("Choose"), forcing Kael from observation to action with the rope. The dominant stake—understanding one's life pattern—tightens when he must risk unraveling his escape tool, though the philosophical dialogue sometimes abstracts the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking the "chronic hush" of grief—escalates from tentative first note to community participation. The bowl's acoustic amplification provides the mechanism for transformation, though the middle section could tighten further. Cost appears in the residents' offerings of precious objects and their tentative voices "testing the air."

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's balance between truth and protective deception—is signaled early and tested through Lira's request. Her need "to forget" creates pressure that forces him to articulate his philosophy about subsuming both sorrow and joy. However, escalation remains modest; the interaction concludes without significant cost or narrowing of options, limiting the piece's dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (recognizing "silent contributors") emerges late and faces minimal pressure. Clara's choice to forge a letter carries no risk or cost - it's pure benevolence without trade-off. The story lacks escalation under its accumulative lens; each beat adds texture but doesn't meaningfully tighten options or force harder choices about compassion's price.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (connection vs. isolation) is clear and escalates through Kael's seven-day search. However, the resolution arrives through Lira's choice to reveal herself rather than through Kael's agency. The "test" concept retroactively reframes the conflict but doesn't create genuine opposition or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from observation → pendant heating → fissure opening → time manipulation → tunnel entry, with each stage narrowing options. The cost appears in physical struggle ("stumbled forward," "tumbled onto rooftop") and the weight of new knowledge. Could strengthen with more immediate physical stakes during the tunnel sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on solving the emotional riddle of brother's disappearance through the glass eyes. Escalation occurs as ritual reveals brother's presence "as a current in the air" forcing Elara to choose between preservation-as-freezing versus preservation-as-flow. Cost visible in accepting perpetual reshaping rather than closure, though pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about the tape to discovering a larger purpose for vulnerable library patrons. The sense memory intensifies appropriately, forcing Mara's choice between safety and revelation. Cost is visible but somewhat abstract—the risk of visibility is stated more than dramatized through immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (Eleanor's need to control vs. plants' need for autonomy) signals early and deepens through the hellebore's metamorphosis. The tightening occurs when Mara stops Eleanor from touching - forcing her to confront her controlling nature. Cost is visible as Eleanor releases decades of methodology, though the resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake - finding meaning after the wars - escalates through accumulation: failed painting → following rain → discovering brooch → exchange with stranger → transformation of art. The brooch-as-catalyst creates meaningful tightening, and Marin's choice to grind amber into pigment shows agency with cost (risking her only lead on answers).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from the cave's unpredictable songs to Elara's choice to accept chaos, with the pearl serving as catalyst. The transformation carries visible cost through the cave's shattering, though the pilgrim's agenda could be clearer to sharpen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake of "compiling fragments into meaning" progresses through accumulation rather than escalation. Each site deepens understanding without raising cost until the final restoration. The method creates its own gentle pressure through patience, though stakes remain abstract—historical completion rather than visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the fortress of unspoken truths—drives consistent forward pressure through the arrow-following sequence. The escalation from following arrows to opening walls to confronting the woman creates meaningful tightening. However, the final cost remains conceptual rather than visceral, and the woman's challenge lacks immediate threat or urgency that would heighten the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative density - whale songs intensify, memories flood, transcription accelerates - building pressure toward Clara's worldview shift. The cost is her skeptical framework yielding to wonder. One significant deepening through Aelia's memories that reweight Clara's understanding satisfies this length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The solar storm's disruption of the amulets creates the story's single meaningful escalation, forcing Kael's choice between familiar imprisonment and terrifying freedom. Cost registers clearly in the mirror vision of his hollow alternative self, though middle development could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes center on protecting the mathematical formula and securing asylum, with escalation through the agents' arrival and gun-drawing. The reveal of the dummy body creates a reversal, though resolution through negotiation feels insufficiently pressured. Cost appears in trading the formula for safety, but the agents' quick capitulation undermines the established threat level.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=3.6)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the lamp pulsing represents the story's only pressure point, but it resolves without consequence or cost. Althea experiences no opposition to her collecting, no trade-offs in her choices. The story maintains stasis rather than building toward any decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal identity mystery to active conspiracy when the skeleton/locket discovery transforms Kael's understanding. The storm sequence provides physical pressure that leads to the crucial find, though the final conspiracy revelation arrives somewhat abruptly through "whisper on the wind" rather than earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—solving the astronomer's riddle—escalates through Lira's cello experiment, with the shell's vibration and dial movement marking genuine deepening. The cost appears in her abandoning her analytical approach ("For the first time in years, Lira didn't rush to explain them away"). However, the resolution feels slightly abrupt; more resistance before the final acceptance would strengthen the earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal mediation to collective resistance as Lira transforms graffiti into organized opposition. The Council's arrival forces crystallization, though their withdrawal feels slightly convenient. Cost registers in the provisional victory—"The fight wasn't over"—with the carnival's soul preserved but future uncertain.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on preserving human presence against automation's indifference, with pressure from the drone countdown creating urgency. The dissolution of the sand grain represents meaningful deepening as Lira accepts obsolescence while asserting value. Cost appears in her walking away from her life's work, though escalation remains gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on the drone repair's success for the maiden voyage, with modest escalation through the servo discovery. The ticking clock of dawn departure provides time pressure but doesn't significantly tighten options. The resolution feels professionally competent rather than dramatically costly - missing the deeper personal stakes that would elevate conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on Clara's quest to understand river origins, with escalation from receiving the singed map to discovering rivers begin in light/pressure rather than water. The glacial trek and midnight ice-chipping show agency under pressure. However, the discovery itself feels somewhat convenient—the glowing veins appear exactly when needed, and the resolution jumps to "years later" without exploring immediate consequences of this world-changing discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: from single footsteps to hundreds, from silence to bell-song, from decay to restoration. The seven-day progression provides clear intensification markers (clock ticking, fountain flowing, bell ringing). The dominant stake of revival-through-rhythm deepens appropriately, though the lack of opposition or complication slightly dampens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation follows accumulative pattern: vial resistance → scent release → memory surge → descent through fissure → symbol activation → hush unsnarling. The storm above creates time pressure that forces action. Cost lands when the thousand voices pierce "her suit, her bones, her soul" and she must override instinct to flee.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—escaping the father's legacy of lies—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure builds through the ghost confrontation, the double encounter, and the labyrinth navigation. The final choice to write rather than run provides meaningful tightening. However, the "bodies" reference creates unresolved tension, and the hovering/magic elements diffuse rather than concentrate pressure at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from mysterious fruit-gifts to "resonant awakenings" when Elara places bead against fruit, forcing the ghost's revelation. The debt-repayment motivation creates coherent pressure. Deduction for relatively passive protagonist (Elara) who mostly receives rather than pursues until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation—each sewn thread builds toward the labyrinth's restoration, with the twin plates' alignment as the decisive deepening moment. Cost is visible in raw fingers and empty plates. The sleepwalker moment could have added more pressure but the overall accumulative tightening lands.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes build through accumulation: from personal quest to shrine restoration to communal faith renewal. The sundial's harmonic activation creates a meaningful deepening that forces Lirael's choice. However, the abstract nature of choosing "faith" lacks the visceral cost or trade-off that would elevate this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from decoding curiosity to family legacy, with the three-year mystery creating sustained pressure. The fountain discovery represents meaningful tightening as disparate clues converge. Cost registers in the grandmother's absence and Lira's tears, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without significant opposition or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake - preserving truth before the coup - is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure builds through Jaxon's arrival and the council's telescope movement, culminating in the flame revelation. However, the conflict lacks visceral immediacy; we never feel the coup's concrete danger or what specific loss Zara risks beyond general "treason."

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake of confronting unspoken words is clear, with one meaningful deepening when messages appear. However, escalation under the accumulative lens lacks sufficient density increase or pattern break - the revelation of messages feels predetermined rather than fought for. No meaningful obstacles or costs complicate Lirael's journey; she simply receives what she came for.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (bridging impossible gaps) signals early and deepens through the child's cast translations. The coral placement at negotiations represents meaningful escalation under the textural lens. Cost is legible but the resolution's ease slightly undermines the established difficulty of peace talks.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal artistic expression to community resurrection as Lira's display unexpectedly triggers recognition ("That's my mother") and collective participation. The fog's attempt to "smother" life creates coherent opposition that "thins, as if embarrassed" when confronted. Cost is legible in "years" of silence broken and Lira's trembling realization that she'd "forgotten how to smile until the world reminded her."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—awakening hidden truths through sound—escalates from testing frequencies to witnessing the mural's dancers to recognizing the flapper with the matching nickel. Each revelation deepens rather than reverses, appropriate for the accumulative lens. The cost materializes in accepting endless questioning over resolution, though physical stakes remain minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from gaining entry ("prove you can warp") to joining the club to executing the resistance plan, with the gourd seed as amplifier raising consequences. The pheromone test creates genuine pressure with pass/fail stakes. Cost remains somewhat abstract—"surveillance" and "taxable thoughts" lack immediate dramatic weight, though the final exposure risk lands.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: postcard arrival → venturing outside → leaving poems in tidal pools → moss blooming → tree growing → finding voice. Each stage narrows Lira's isolation and forces greater vulnerability. The cost of releasing centuries of guarded work is visible, though pressure could intensify more sharply in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from maintaining equilibrium to reimagining preservation itself, with the glass-orchids' potential unraveling providing constant pressure. The cost manifests when extinct feelings stir—"joy" and "grief" drift past—showing the real price of Lirael's choice to create rather than merely maintain.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from professional challenge (translating the letter) to personal revelation (the letter's message about silence damming love) to active choice (calling Mira). The wedding invitation provides time pressure. The cost - years of lost connection - is palpable. Minor issue: Henrik's challenge could have provided more sustained opposition before yielding.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decrypting compassion—is signaled early but lacks escalating pressure under the accumulative lens. The amphitheater's breathing quickens and rivers roar, but these remain atmospheric rather than forcing trade-offs. The resolution emerges through methodical process rather than meaningful tightening that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake - preserving the echo of lost songs - signals early but escalation occurs primarily through discovery rather than active pressure. The pigeon's return with empty scroll case represents the sole on-page reversal; most development happens through passive revelation (finding the cassette, dream interpretation) rather than choices that narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pattern recognition—from reading weather codes to analyzing wood grain to discovering the hidden path—with each revelation narrowing Lira's options. The cost manifests in her choice to step through the light-door knowing "sacred thresholds weren't meant to be revisited," though the stakes could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake of finding "rhythm of belonging" progresses through Mara's invitation and the group's shared experience. The alignment provides meaningful deepening as skepticism transforms to wonder. However, the conflict lacks sharp edges—no character genuinely resists or pays a price for this connection, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering why paths disappear—is signaled early and maintains coherence. There's one meaningful deepening when the shard's regret "pulses" in response to the seed, changing Lira's understanding. However, escalation lacks protagonist agency; Lira mostly observes and conjectures rather than making choices with visible trade-offs, and the final revelation arrives through passive observation of the pool rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: individual reactions (teen pausing, vendor's curiosity) crescendo to collective movement toward the fountain. The "deliberate discord" creates the pivot point. Cost appears in the disruption of routines—vendor abandons cart, clown mechanism fails—though agency remains somewhat passive observation rather than decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on Lirael's need for renewal against the nostalgia ban's prohibition, with pressure building through the dance's intensification and the burning pain of verse-writing. However, the Council of Whispers remains abstract, never manifesting as concrete opposition. The cost of defiance—potential madness—is declared but not viscerally felt beyond physical exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding value in the mundane—is signaled early and maintained throughout, with the stone-throwing creating a minor deepening as patterns emerge. However, escalation is minimal; there's no tightening of options or meaningful pressure that forces choice. The resolution arrives through contemplation rather than earned struggle, lacking the visible price or foreclosed path that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of self-forgiveness is signaled early and deepens through the hourglass revelation, though escalation is primarily internal/reflective rather than driven by external pressure. The tightening occurs when memories surface and Elias chooses acceptance over continued self-punishment, with emotional cost visible in his rare smile and softened face.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding hope equations across fractured realities—escalates through the trial balloon sequence, with each thread color representing a different timeline's cost. The moment when "the grotto's walls vanished" marks a meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding. The tension between seeing failed versions of herself and choosing to continue creates genuine pressure with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (discovering walls' dreams/understanding legacy) signals early and deepens through diary discoveries that narrow Lira's understanding from external to internal. The walls' grinding creates physical pressure mid-scene. Cost becomes visible when she burns the film negative, accepting the burden. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length, though the final "you are the map" revelation could use more concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on Lirael's need to "persuade mirrors to show possibilities beyond their edges" - essentially to breach death's boundary. The escalation through three increasingly difficult mirrors (ornate to round to cracked) shows mounting cost through her sweating and exhaustion. The bells create time pressure that forces completion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.6)
    Escalation follows the textural pattern appropriately—from "posturing... accusations" through "weary resignation" to final signatures—but lacks concrete stakes or specific treaty terms that would make the cost tangible. The shift from hostility to resignation marks genuine progression, yet the abstract nature of the conflict ("terms of a treaty that could reshape nations") prevents full engagement with what's actually at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving an echo versus accepting extinction—tightens through the ritual's progression from placing to water-pouring to walking away. The philanthropist's agency drives each micro-choice with accumulating futility as cost. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful reversal or deepening beyond the initial setup; the phantom trill could have created more pressure if it forced a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on defying conformity's "lullaby" through unlocking trapped echoes. Escalation builds as Lirael's dance intensifies from "slow at first" to "more urgent" movements, with threads responding and finally snapping free. The resolution is earned through her agency, though the opposition (conformity) remains somewhat abstract rather than embodied in concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding ethical storytelling after compromising truth for elegance—is signaled early and tested through the puppet show performance. The drifter's challenge ("Sounds like you're just making excuses for half-truths") forces Elias to crystallize his stance, though this confrontation could carry more immediate cost. The resolution through accepting paradox ("Half-truths are the only kind worth telling") represents a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring the moth's death before the monarch passes—creates gentle pressure but never truly escalates. The monarch's arrival and departure constitute the only turn, and Lirael faces no opposition or complication to her goal. The "interrupted cadence" of her breathing mirrors her work but doesn't deepen conflict or force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving his mother's forgotten voice—is clear early and tightens as Kael works the rope mechanism despite trembling hands. The ritual's physical demands (aching back, raw hands) provide concrete cost. However, escalation feels somewhat mechanical through the rope's stages rather than driven by deepening internal pressure or meaningful reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding "why paths choose walkers"—is signaled early but escalation remains largely internal and conceptual. The storm provides external pressure that enables the dream sequence, but no meaningful tightening occurs that forecloses options with visible cost. The revelation from the hologram arrives without Mara's agency driving it, reducing tension despite the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (uncovering celestial secrets vs. accepting uncertainty) established early and tightens when the tile reveals "a mirror" of intentions rather than answers. The escalation from physical exploration to philosophical acceptance works, though the disembodied voice reduces tangible opposition. Cost lands in accepting questions over answers.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are declared ("teaching resentment to release") but each visitor interaction follows the same template without escalation—anger, explanation, touching pin, release. No meaningful tightening occurs; Kael's slight resistance ("This is a trick") resolves too easily. The "reality's shifts were not infinite" suggests urgency but never manifests as actual constraint affecting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from fixing a broken instrument to capturing a runaway dream through synchronized collaboration. The pressure coheres as breathing synchronization literally manifests the glass mountain path. Cost appears in the sextant's permanent transformation and the implication of future dream-seekers.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (keeping the orchard alive despite abandonment) is clear, but escalation is minimal - Lira climbs, finds eye, mends it, orchard blooms. The breach of contract provides backstory pressure but doesn't create active conflict in the present scene. The transformation lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening that would raise the cost of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (pursuing forbidden nonlinear inheritance) escalates from discovery of the cameo through the fractal revelation to the final choice to fuse with the tree. Cost is visible—Elara sacrifices institutional credibility—though the museum board's opposition remains abstract rather than embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (accessing the library) is clear, with one meaningful tightening when Elara must "acknowledge her ignorance" to proceed. However, escalation feels mechanical - the guardian test resolves too easily through humming a childhood tune. The negotiation lacks genuine risk or trade-off beyond abstract acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding the garden) escalates through Veyra's skepticism, the hidden room discovery, and memory flooding that reweights the quest's meaning. The cost is legible—losing the ship as "trapped freedom" transforms to "just freedom." One meaningful deepening occurs when the garden reveals itself as choice rather than place.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from academic curiosity to reality-management responsibility, with the gear jamming creating immediate physical danger that tests Elara's resolve. The cost becomes clear when she must accept her transformed role, though the middle section could use more concrete opposition beyond mechanical resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating sensory pressure: energy beings' "dissonant hum" → "razor-edged" laughter → "tidal wave of noise" → pure tone that "erased all others." The mapkeeper's agency drives the resolution through deliberate action (pressing stone to spiral, conjuring the bloom). Cost is felt through physical pain ("teeth ached," "ribs ache") that releases only after success.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as failed attempts compound into bleeding fingers and storm-threatened work, with the dominant stake (proving meaning exists in chaos) tightening when moonlight finally refracts. The cost is legible in physical toll and years surrendered, though the storm's arrival could feel less coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding memory's relationship to identity—emerges through Lirael's deepening engagement with the forecourt. Escalation reads as textural accumulation: fog solidifies → shadows stretch → crystal hums → participation replaces observation. However, the pressure lacks urgency; the fog's fracturing creates time pressure but doesn't sufficiently raise the cost of her choices or force harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal redemption to igniting dormant potential, with the kerosene knot's flame spreading to trigger the chain reaction. The cost is visible in Lira's transformation to "becoming fire," though the middle lacks a clear tightening moment under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (relationship impasse) is clear from Kael's quoted challenge. Escalation occurs through Elara's internal realization that she must "bridge the gaps between people" and her decisive action with the cicada. However, the resolution feels somewhat predetermined - Kael's acceptance comes too easily without sufficient on-page resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (escaping claustrophobia through silence collection) tightens when the doll—her "anchor"—floats away irretrievably. The hourly time limit creates genuine pressure, and the father's "limit your exposure" warning establishes risk. Cost manifests in the permanent loss and days of mourning, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily through the sprout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding how to heal the terrace's anxiety through silence—is clear, but escalation remains gentle. The storm glass stilling provides the key turn, yet this arrives without sufficient pressure or complication; Elara's weeks of struggle are told rather than dramatized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate through time pressure (sunrise deadline) and physical challenge (climbing the humming stairway past bones of failed predecessors), with the guardian providing a final test. However, the resolution through answering a riddle rather than paying a tangible price weakens the cost—Lira gains everything without sacrificing anything concrete on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether isolation protects or destroys—escalates through Elara's choice to use the doorknocker despite knowing the risk. Kael's crossing of the threshold ("The sanctuary shuddered") represents a meaningful tightening that forecloses her isolation. Cost is visible in the sanctuary's reaction and her acceptance of vulnerability. The conflict could benefit from more concrete consequences of the "fading thresholds."

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the diamonds crystallize and threaten implosion, forcing Mara's decision. The quantum device messages create mounting tension ("The bolt is a key. Turn it."), though the stakes feel somewhat contained to this single choice rather than deeply testing Mara's core values.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - uncovering the truth about her dynasty's end - is signaled early and tightens through the gramophone sequence. The standing waves create escalating pressure from "groan" to "crackle" to room-altering vibrations, with Lirael's agency driving each turn of the crank. However, the conflict lacks significant resistance; the revelations come too easily once the mechanism activates, missing opportunities for meaningful obstacles or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation tracks from discovering the program through unsnapping strings to reality dissolution, with each action narrowing options under the accumulative lens. The cost becomes visible as Cedric loses his armor and the greenhouse crumbles, though the middle section could show more immediate stakes between program discovery and string-cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (finding meaning in forgotten histories) is signaled early but pressure remains static—Elias moves through discoveries without meaningful resistance or cost. The button's discovery and date revelation deepen knowledge but don't force trade-offs. Agency exists in the final decision to document, but escalation under the Accumulative lens needed sharper density increase or pattern break.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal proof ("prove them wrong") to systemic exposure of erased dissent, with the three-minute drone window creating time pressure. The underwater escape with exploding station provides concrete cost. Agency drives the infiltration and evidence distribution, though the explosion's timing feels slightly convenient rather than earned through protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal haunting to active threat as the figure materializes and speaks the prophecy Elias must silence. The saxophone's progression from "low, mournful cry" to "frantic staccato" to final "wail" shows meaningful intensification with cost ("lungs burning"), though the figure's dissolution feels slightly convenient without more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (decoding the message) is signaled early and deepens through the moonstone discovery and monument-building sequence. Escalation follows the accumulative lens as density increases—dust trail leads to monuments which draw leaves whose messages become readable. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost; accepting three tasks (harvest, warn, seek) doesn't show meaningful trade-offs or foreclosed options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding truth versus accepting uncertainty—signals early and tightens when Elias must physically risk himself for the compass. The waterfall plunge creates genuine danger with consequence (hitting water hard, struggling to surface). However, the resolution feels slightly convenient; the compass's behavior as "weighing possibilities" arrives without sufficient resistance or cost beyond the physical ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (understanding Lira's fate) is signaled early and deepens through the coin's activation and Lira's appearance. The escalation from physical action (dropping coin) to spectral encounter provides one meaningful turn, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily without forcing Kael into a harder choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—integrating laughter into healing—faces meaningful deepening when the spectral figure challenges Lira's assumption, forcing her to confront deeper truth. The cost registers in her admission of fear and acceptance that healing requires enduring pain. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat; the spectral figure's disappearance and immediate warmth lack the friction expected at this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking "mathematics of mercy" through physical endurance (UV spores burning) to accepting mercy as an unanswerable question requiring continuous choice. The woman's arrival provides the tightening that forces Elias to articulate and accept his transformed understanding, with cost visible in his ongoing trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from seeking anchors of intuition to unfastening reality's fabric to reclaiming drowned worlds' memories. The ink transformation creates meaningful escalation by revealing hidden instructions. Cost manifests in the fragment's "sharp yet soft" edges and the weight of forgotten histories.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the ghosts' trapped story—signals early and tightens when Elias discovers the hidden compartment. Escalation occurs through physical investigation (floor→counter→ceiling) with the ghost clown pointing toward resolution. The cost remains primarily emotional rather than forcing a trade-off, and agency manifests through observation and acknowledgment rather than a decisive choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from Elara's secret whisper-distilling to the discovery of the spiral anomaly, then to her frantic printing that risks "unravel[ing] not just the library but the very clouds it floated upon." The transformation costs the library's order and Elara's role, though protagonist agency feels slightly mechanical in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on proving Luminari fraudulence versus Council's myth-making, with escalation through mirror-covering during temporal storm to fungal bloom revelation. The cost is visible in Kael's heretic status and the societal upheaval beginning. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the Council's opposition could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from mechanical repair to moral reckoning as Elias reveals the box requires truth rather than technical skill. Lira's admission "I knew he lied about the mine" carries genuine cost in acknowledging complicity. The pressure coheres under the textural lens through accumulating revelations about the stone's nature, though the single confrontation point limits deeper escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from collecting curiosity through the compass's intensifying behavior to the lagoon's indifferent presence, with Lira's realization that "human logic didn't apply" forcing her retreat. The cost—accepting mysteries must stay unsolved—lands clearly, though the expedition's fate resolution feels slightly deflated by explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding the island's fractured timelines—escalates through the portal crossing, but Lira faces no meaningful opposition or trade-offs. The transformation happens to her rather than through her agency, with convenient revelations replacing earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes build through Mara's deepening obsession and the window's progressive revelations, but escalation plateaus after finding the violet glass inscription. The final understanding arrives without sufficient pressure or trade-off - the "communion" insight lacks dramatized opposition or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from archival discovery to personal dissolution ("her own identity fraying") to confronting systemic erasure, with the lagoon's time limit adding pressure. The final confrontation forces a true sacrifice, though the antagonist's convenient appearance undermines earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reviving a dead civilization through memory—is clear from the opening. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of artifacts and the bottle's growing warmth, culminating in the cove's awakening. However, the middle lacks active opposition or meaningful tightening; Elias faces no real obstacles to his methodical work until the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from decoding a curiosity to understanding an impending world-shift, with the foghorn's silence creating temporal pressure. The discovery of the "harmonic hum" beneath the shriek deepens understanding. However, the protagonist faces no genuine opposition or difficult trade-offs—his path from curiosity to acceptance lacks meaningful resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from waiting for the egg to hatch, through the creature's emergence, to Lirael's dangerous dive into the vortex. The dominant stake - discovering borrowed time's texture while reopening the path - tightens as she must offer "just enough chaos" without unraveling stability. Cost is legible: the shock and breathlessness of the vortex pull, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—maintaining harmony between sanctuary and storms—escalates from routine bell testing to actively calming agitated weather patterns. The secondary rope discovery creates a meaningful turn that forces Lira to manage unintended consequences. However, Veyra's arrival deflates some tension by providing immediate guidance, and the resolution feels too smooth once Lira finds the alternating rhythm pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—validating spiritual observation over mechanical tracking—escalates through Zara's decision to follow the fractured star despite Veyra's dismissal. The journey to the crater and kneeling beside dying starlight shows agency through attention. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful tightening that would force trade-offs; Zara's choice costs her little beyond time, limiting the pressure that drives transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure: ghosts becoming visible, then solid, then the box glowing and revealing visions. The dominant stake (releasing unspoken words) tightens when Elias must choose between preserving silence and speaking. Cost is legible in the decades of solitude broken, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering time's texture after clocks fail—is signaled early and tightens when Elias discovers the capsule's broken mechanisms require poetic cataloguing rather than repair. The mercury stilling and wife's face appearing provide escalation, though some transitions feel convenience-driven rather than earned through protagonist agency. The final cost (leaving the urn fragment) lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of finding beauty in discord is signaled early but lacks escalating pressure—the kite string's snap catalyzes action without creating opposition or raising cost. The fisherman's nod provides minimal external validation but no meaningful complication or choice-forcing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal project to interspecies harmony, with the spirit's resistance creating genuine tension ("The spirits were never violent, but their displeasure could shake foundations"). The copper-wire connection serves as the meaningful tightening point. Cost is visible in Lira's death, though middle escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (exposing fraud vs. discovering truth) tightens when the amber dissolves and reality inverts. However, Kael's appearance reduces tension by providing explanations rather than forcing Lirael to discover through action. The "familiar longing" provides emotional cost but lacks the visceral price that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming battlefield through garden) intensifies through accumulating details rather than reversals, fitting the textural lens. The bird's "Khalis" message deepens meaning effectively. Cost is visible in the reef's death and the slow, patient work required. Escalation could be stronger - the storm gathering adds atmosphere but doesn't fundamentally alter options.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes escalate through riddle progression from names to memory to love, each answer building communal understanding. However, no riddle creates genuine difficulty or forces a trade-off—Hush solves each through immediate intuition without cost or struggle, reducing tension despite the accumulative deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elio's isolation versus connection—escalates from passive observation through the grandmother's visitation to his active choice to follow the compass. The cost is legible when he leaves his familiar exile for the unknown path. However, the escalation relies heavily on the apparition event rather than protagonist-driven pressure, and the final movement through the door lacks immediate opposition or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear dominant stake established early (prevent spire collapse/save Aetheria) with escalating pressure through the groaning walls, trembling chamber, and darkening sky. The chess piece swap creates genuine tension with each move increasing risk. Cost is visible in the physical danger and magical resistance, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the board's secrets to document unseen historical moments—tightens through Elara's persistent walking against the gallery's resistance, culminating in the board's reconfiguration. The cost appears in her aching scars and the choice to leave rather than hide, though the middle section could apply more direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes build from personal need ("understand the shape of home") through mother's revelation to accepting a larger role as memory-weaver. The feather activation creates a decisive turn, though the cavern sequence with falling stones frozen into feathers stretches credibility slightly without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from external (unfreezing village) to internal (self-forgiveness) as Alaric winnows the threads and confronts his memory. The black thread moment forces him to face his guilt directly, with cost visible when he accepts that the prince's death created wounds that can only be "woven into something new." The resolution comes through his agency in touching the pedestal and accepting the woven hush.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from artistic defiance to disrupting a binding ritual with community-wide consequences. The confrontation with the elder provides one meaningful tightening, though her curiosity shift feels abrupt. Cost is visible—tomorrow's heresy charge—but the immediate consequence of mass enlightenment lacks darker complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from uncertainty about the charm's purpose through memories surfacing to the final choice to remove the respirator and embrace the acid's burn. The progression from "adjusting her respirator" to deliberately removing it shows agency foreclosing safety with visible cost, though middle beats could tighten the pressure more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake of finding solace progresses through Elias's choice to enter the cave and place his shell. However, escalation is gentle rather than pressured - more accumulation than conflict. The "wrong turn" framing suggests higher stakes than delivered. Cost exists but lacks the sharp edge of true conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—escalates from private experiment to Thalos's interruption to village-wide transmission. The tension builds through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens. However, Thalos's instant support deflates potential conflict, and the success feels too frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating midnight calls that provide cryptic instructions, each deepening Mara's commitment and physical investment. The cost is visible in her exhaustion ("sweat dripping") and emotional release. The moon's fluctuating influence on the censer foot creates natural pressure that tightens toward the noon climax when signals finally return.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake of psychological safety is signaled early and tightens when Jorn's ledger revelation forces Mara to choose between hiding and acting. The storm creates external pressure but the escalation relies heavily on Jorn's exposition rather than dramatized conflict, and the final cost of choosing truth remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from investigating a flower to uncovering deliberate murder and memory theft. The revelation about the captain's guilt and the woman's stolen memories creates meaningful pressure. However, Elias's final choice to return memories lacks immediate dramatic tension—there's no opposing force at the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of confronting stagnation escalates from curiosity to physical journey to psychological confrontation. The vision sequence provides meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the emotional weight of confronting lost family, though physical stakes remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal disenchantment through prophetic warning to existential confrontation, with the climb providing physical pressure that mirrors internal conflict. The revelation that "you bleed because the starlight bleeds" creates meaningful deepening, though the resolution lacks a concrete price—understanding alone doesn't demonstrate what she sacrifices or gains.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear dominant stake: saving the nexus before its light fails completely. Escalation occurs through the revelation of the "palette of resolve" concept that reframes Elara's approach. The cost is legible—three destroyed engines, the risk of another explosion—though the final success comes somewhat easily once the perspective shift occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake of reconciling with one's past selves escalates from grave discovery through scroll instructions to cave revelation, with each beat narrowing the protagonist's understanding of his temporal predicament. The climb despite physical limitation ("limp and permanent distrust of gravity") shows agency under pressure. The resolution lacks a visceral cost—the "bittersweet clarity" and compass metaphor feel conceptual rather than dramatically earned through concrete struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering Mrs. Voss's emotional truth through the screw—builds through accumulation: engraving discovery, photo correlation, realization about Eleanor. Pressure coheres as details narrow toward revelation. However, escalation relies on Lira's detective work rather than active opposition, and Mrs. Voss's absence prevents direct confrontation of the discovered truth.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating ritual elements (quill placement, ink mixing, incantation, childhood rhyme) toward the crystallization moment. The risk of "shards that cut the caster's soul" provides clear stakes. The resolution feels slightly rushed after the buildup, with the forest path appearing too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake - reconnecting with the dead sister - is clear from Elias's introduction. Pressure builds through Clara's investigation and the revelation about induced currents. However, escalation feels mechanical rather than emotionally charged; the reconnection happens too easily once Clara explains the method, lacking meaningful resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—unraveling cosmic illusions versus accepting mystery—emerges clearly but escalates through philosophical abstraction rather than concrete pressure. The mural scene provides one meaningful deepening when figures step out and challenge the Witness to "see yourself," forcing internal confrontation. However, the resolution lacks visible cost; the Witness achieves peace without demonstrating what illusions were abandoned or what understanding was sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The counting ritual creates escalating tension as perception shifts and the fjord reveals its secret. The dominant stake—understanding time's true nature—deepens through accumulation, though agency remains primarily observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming rigid defensive systems through surrender—escalates from technical analysis to emotional understanding to systemic change. The barrier's shift from "afraid" to flowing creates meaningful pressure. Cost becomes visible when the barriers dissolve completely, risking vulnerability for strength.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from Clara following cryptic clues to confronting a supernatural subway car where she must choose at the fork "where time bends," with her father's teachings about chaos guiding her decision. The pressure coheres through accumulation of contradictory messages leading to the crystallized choice moment. Cost is legible in her tears and the implicit confrontation with her father's mortality she's been avoiding.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulating wrong-number connections that transform isolation into belonging, with the disc's melody as textural pressure. The pattern of misdirected calls creates coherent escalation, though individual call stakes could carry more immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through density increase as Elara moves from documenting to actively steeping the photo in ink. The dominant stake (preserving the covenant through small acts) tightens when she realizes her great-grandmother "vanished" after the renewal, suggesting real cost. But the escalation lacks a decisive moment where options narrow palpably.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from seeking a cure to confronting what loneliness actually is, with the moon rock's warming and pulsing marking progression. The conductor's challenge forces Elias to reconsider his entire premise, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (finding the stillpoint/mother) drives forward through accumulating sensory pressures. The ring's translations and the river's command create meaningful turns. However, escalation plateaus rather than intensifies - the discovery feels predetermined rather than hard-won against mounting opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt to understanding history's web structure, with the girl's fever as concrete cost. The anomaly's reaction to Elias creates immediate pressure, and Lira's intervention forces him to confront his approach's limitations. The meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes editing requires collaboration not control, though the resolution's ease (fever breaking immediately) slightly undercuts earned difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - translating silence into communal music - develops through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. Pressure builds as more townspeople join, creating collective investment. However, the conflict lacks visceral tension; there's no real opposition to Kael's goal, and the transformation happens too smoothly without meaningful resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen as Mara's artistic interventions literally reshape the archive, building from individual paintings to the climactic portrait healing. The tension between preservation and transformation provides consistent pressure. The cost becomes tangible in her tears and role acceptance, though middle escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding Eli's connection to the lagoon—remains consistent but lacks escalating pressure. The drumming scene provides one meaningful deepening as shared rhythm transforms understanding, but there's no visible price paid. The arrival of the female character adds possibility but doesn't genuinely complicate or raise costs.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers beat shouts—manifests through Elias's navigation choices and culminates in his final refusal to shout directions. The geomagnetic storm provides escalating pressure (lights flickering, containers shifting), and Voss's challenge creates a ticking clock. However, the discovery of the chamber feels coincidental rather than earned through protagonist agency, and the "double pay" prize undercuts the personal stakes Elias claims.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the dominant stake of bringing light to darkness is clear, escalation remains static—Lira performs her ritual without encountering resistance or having to adapt her tactics. The fisherman's question provides minimal pressure, and the "stillwater tension" never meaningfully tightens or forces Lira to make a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through seven chess games where Lila's unspoken words shift from "I'm alone" to "I'm learning"—a textural deepening under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake (connection through grief) tightens as Clara reveals knowing Lila's father. Cost is legible in Lila losing all games while still returning, though could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—freedom versus attachment to the island—escalates when the whale appears and Lira must release the scrimshaw, foreclosing her connection to the past. However, the "violence" that triggers departure remains vague, and the cost of letting go feels more declared than dramatized through concrete losses.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preserving grief against mandated happiness—faces steady accumulative pressure through the whittling ritual, with each stage ("find the grain," "shape the bowl," "smooth the edges") deepening resistance. Cost is visible in the family's loss and Lirael's reduced state, though the conflict remains primarily internal without a decisive tightening moment beyond the commitment to continue.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract—"dissolution of boundaries" and "the sacred and profane might blur"—without concrete opposition or cost. Lirael achieves her goal of reshaping reality but faces no resistance; the world simply yields to her will. No meaningful tightening occurs under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias finding beauty in his colorblind world—escalates through the magical reed tongue discovery and cobalt dust transformation, with cost visible in his headache and disorientation. However, the phoenix backstory revelation doesn't organically emerge from protagonist agency but rather from sudden magical vision, weakening the earned quality of the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—progresses through Lira's questioning and exploration, with one meaningful deepening when she realizes the cave itself is an instrument. However, the artificial pilgrimage lacks genuine risk or resistance; the world "still reeling from the grid's collapse" is mentioned but never pressures her choices, and the discovery comes too easily without meaningful obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief into renewal—maintains coherence but lacks significant tightening or reversal. The discovery that shadows become "invitations" provides a deepening moment, yet this arrives without sufficient pressure or trade-off. The cost (bleeding fingers, emotional exhaustion) feels proportionate but doesn't force a meaningful choice between competing goods. Agency manifests primarily through endurance rather than decisive action under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—mapping/rebuilding culture after crypto crashes—is signaled early and maintained. Escalation occurs through Mara's transformation from skeptic ("Hope?") to believer ("I'll bring others"). However, the conflict lacks sufficient resistance; Mara converts too easily without meaningful obstacles or cost. The measuring tape's revelatory power needs more concrete demonstration of struggle before acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to embrace or resist dangerous knowledge—is established early through the forbidden pagoda. Pressure escalates through the pagoda's increasing activity (shimmer to hum to light). However, Kael's opposition provides minimal resistance before he simply vanishes, and the resolution lacks concrete cost beyond abstract acceptance of "questions" over "answers."

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on preserving/reshaping hope through the shadow's metamorphosis, with escalation from discovery to investigation to transformation. The pressure builds adequately though the personal cost to Lirael beyond tears remains understated - the story privileges conceptual over visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether compassion is weakness or strength—deepens through the reconstruction process, with each scale placement representing rebellion against cynicism. The con's revelation forecloses her previous path (working with the handlers), creating genuine cost. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens, though middle sections could tighten pressure more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract—"seeking closure" and "untangling threads" never face concrete tests. The visions show past events but don't force Mara to choose or sacrifice. The hourglass shattering happens to her rather than through her agency, undermining earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) deepens through psychometric revelations that narrow Mara's understanding from abstract to specific. The tightening occurs when she discovers the letters were never sent and love remained "unused." Cost is legible in the emotional weight but lacks a harder trade-off or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: adjusting the sextant, hearing voices, discovering the chamber, absorbing stardust, experiencing cosmic dissolution. The cost manifests physically ("sank to his knees") and psychologically (walls dissolving into overwhelming sky), though agency becomes somewhat passive once discovery begins.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal (Kael's dreamlessness) through systemic (fading sparks) to resolution (cultivation). The clock discovery tightens pressure when sand dims. Cost manifests in Kael's physical multiplication and the archive's transformation, though the "occasionally everywhere" mechanism feels convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest (finding father) to preserving the forest's wild-mechanical balance. The gear's transformation from memento to seed deepens pressure—Elara must sacrifice her last connection to her father. Cost registers in the trade-off: keeping the gear means losing the wild frontier; planting it means accepting permanent separation.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes center on the guides' duty to help travelers find "unused courage" through the ridgeway's tests. The journey escalates through encounters with various travelers and Jorin's growing understanding, culminating in the clearing revelation. While the philosophical stakes are clear and the cost is conceptual (understanding courage as ongoing choice), the immediate physical or emotional pressures could be more visceral to heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding safety's true cost—escalates from abstract philosophy to concrete crisis when Lady Veyra arrives. Elric's agency drives the resolution through his choice to speak and fix the bolt. The cost is visible in the broken silence and altered fortress dynamic, though the transformation feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (unmasking the pretender/reclaiming legacy) is signaled early and maintained throughout. The Silent Convergence creates time pressure that forces action. The escalation follows a clear path: research → discovery → infiltration → confrontation, with Veyra's agency driving each step. However, the pretender offers no active resistance, reducing tension at the climactic moment—the sundering happens too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.6)
    Initial conflict between Lira's findings and Kael's dismissal establishes clear stakes around scientific truth versus institutional denial. However, escalation jumps from data analysis to mystical journey without intermediate pressure points, and Kael's instant conversion from skeptic to believer during the storm lacks the resistance that would create meaningful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal ("They think I'm mad") through discovery (stones' symbols) to collective transformation (rebellion reignited). The hum's crescendo provides accumulative pressure that forces Lira's decisive action. Cost appears in the risk of failure and the collective commitment required.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clear escalation from finding kite → decoding message → discovering vault → choosing how to use embryo. The dominant stake (evolving tradition vs. control) tightens as Nana moves from curiosity to decision with visible cost - she risks being called "mad" but commits anyway. Agency drives every beat through her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding peace after trauma—is clear from the opening, with one meaningful deepening when Lila moves from scoffing at somatic markers to actively using them. The cost appears in her acceptance of loss without erasure. However, Mrs. Voss's arrival lacks tension, and the conflict remains largely internal without significant external pressure beyond the initial trauma.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Elias moves from passive observation to active creation—collecting threads, tearing cards, painting with crushed tarot ink. The walls "closing in" creates urgency that forces his descent "into necessary darkness." Cost appears in his acceptance of fragmentation over order, though the metaphorical walls lack a concrete consequence that would elevate stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from following the drone to discovering the tower's reality to confronting what "stole" her brother. The child's revelation that "time gets stuck" meaningfully deepens understanding. Cost is visible in Lira's decision to defy the elders' warnings, though the final confrontation remains ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake - preserving vs. revealing truth - escalates from internal conflict to external action when Lirael awakens Kael. The cost is clear: she sacrifices her position and safety. However, the Council threat remains abstract without immediate pressure in scene, and the revolution's launch feels declarative rather than earned through mounting opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Lira will embrace or abandon her father's legacy—intensifies through the accumulation of paradoxes (weight/freedom, confinement/growth) reaching the crystallized moment where she embeds the sandbag scrap beneath the rose. The cost appears in "hands calloused from soil, not combat" and her acceptance that the farm demands presence over force, though the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through the garden's increasing dissonance, Kael's deliberate spike strikes creating different resonances, to the goddess's manifestation and dissolution—each step narrowing options under the textural lens. The cost of losing the goddess to save the constellations is clear, though the middle could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (family legacy vs. truth) is clear with escalation from suspicion through discovery to public exposure. Clara's agency drives the investigation and decision to publish. The cost is visible (family fracture, public backlash), though the compressed timeline and convenient evidence discovery ("Pay off the inspector" note) reduce tension.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—confronting the scientists' guilt to prevent dissonance consuming everyone—is established early and escalates when Lira must face her mother's specific guilt. The personal cost of confronting childhood abandonment charges the final forgiveness. However, the threat of "dissonance will consume us all" remains abstract without concrete demonstration of what consumption means.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal documentation to decoding collective truth, with the tile's urgency ("pulsed faster") creating time pressure. The "interject" directive forces a meaningful choice between preserving or disrupting the emergent hush. Cost appears in Mara's shift from cherishing silence to actively engaging it, though the physical/emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—rebuilding meaning from destruction—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation or tightening. Elias's placement of the tessera represents agency through symbolic action, but no opposing force or internal resistance creates genuine conflict. The story presents aftermath without active pressure, making the resolution feel predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes emerge clearly: mend the fracturing timeline before possibilities wither. Pressure escalates from solo humming to chorus-weaving to collective dance, with the tarot coin warming and reshaping to signal intensification. The reversal when the flapper recognizes him as "earlier" recontextualizes the timeline problem, though the resolution through dance lacks a sharper cost-driven choice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding authentic awareness without corporate pills—is clear, with escalation through Elias's experimental process. However, the conflict lacks immediate pressure; Mara's gentle questioning doesn't create genuine opposition, and the "breakthrough" moment arrives without sufficient resistance or cost to feel fully earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: fossil reveals emotional history → projects timeline → floats → dissolves into spores → transforms Lira. Each stage narrows her path from observer to participant. However, the transformation lacks resistance or genuine struggle - Lira accepts each escalation without meaningful internal conflict about the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through the jar's increasing resonance and Mara's methodical button-sorting, with the echo's message forcing her stance crystallization. The release of the echo into the world carries clear cost (giving up possession of the relic), though escalation could tighten further in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.6)
    Pressure accumulates through textural layering (memories surface, wind plays tricks, mist parts) rather than causal escalation, fitting the accumulative lens. The dominant stake—reclaiming courage—tightens once when Mara commits to transcribing despite paranoia, though cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Thaddeus waits, boards, crosses, and disembarks without encountering resistance or making difficult choices. The "palimpsest promise" suggests layered vows but never manifests as concrete pressure. The rain gutters' ticking provides temporal boundary but doesn't tighten options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from understanding resistance to witnessing fractured timelines, with the sunflowers' endurance forcing Mara's realization about nurturing chosen timelines. The vision sequence provides meaningful deepening rather than reversal. Cost becomes legible in the "stubborn hive of memory" she leaves behind.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—bringing light to darkness—is clear early and deepens when Elias decides to try again with Mara despite past failure. The pressure builds modestly through his descent to the docks and approach to her shop. However, escalation remains gentle without significant opposition or cost until the final acceptance, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of independence versus isolation is signaled early but escalation remains gentle—the sundial's glow and library's transformation happen to Lirael rather than resulting from her agency. The hum's crescendo provides texture but doesn't force difficult trade-offs. The final choice to write lacks opposition or visible cost beyond the abstract "coexistence" already achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Lila's fear of disconnection—is signaled early through her hollow feeling despite helping others connect. Pressure builds through the spiral's mystery, Elara's challenge, and the installation's demand for vulnerability. The final act of writing and releasing her secret demonstrates agency with emotional cost, though escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes escalate from community division to direct confrontation with tricksters, with Lila's intervention as the pivot. The resolution feels too easy - the tricksters yield after one subsonic pulse without meaningful resistance or cost to Lila.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (obtaining the key) faces escalating spatial obstacles and the organ's tests, with one meaningful tightening when the corridor rebels against intrusion. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient when stabbing the compass instantly solves the spatial mutiny, and the final "whatever came next" lacks specific cost articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on solving Lila's disappearance, with escalation through the handprint discovery and locket revelation. The pressure builds adequately but lacks the visceral urgency that would elevate the score—the investigation proceeds too smoothly without meaningful obstacles or reversals that would test Clara's methods under real stress.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (reversing ancestral exile/shame) is signaled early but escalation remains modest—Clara moves from discovery to investigation to ritual attempt without meaningful tightening of options. The director's evacuation warning provides external pressure but Clara dismisses it without cost ("Wait. There's something I need to do first"). The final ritual attempt lacks visible price or consequence; we don't see what Clara risks or loses.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake - understanding and using the pixelated amnesty to reshape possibility - is signaled early and maintained. However, escalation occurs primarily through Elias's fiddle-playing rather than through meaningful opposition or cost. The transformation happens without visible price paid; Marisol's reappearance feels convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—breaking cycles of greed—is declared but never tested through present action with consequence. Marcus's growing restlessness happens offstage; Elias watches "from a distance" without risk or cost. No meaningful escalation occurs; the bills create vague unease but don't force any character into a decisive choice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear dominant stake (understanding the temple/finding brother) that deepens when Veyra reveals the inscriptions demand "shared burdens." The pressure coheres as Lirael must surrender her protective detachment, with visible cost in accepting others' pain. Could be stronger if the middle section had more active resistance before acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—discovering hidden truths about herself—escalates through the vortex pulling her in, the seed's release, and the vision's revelation. Cost is visible in confronting the buried memory of killing someone. The tension builds adequately through "expanding circles" of consciousness, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once the seed does its work.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from finding the intersection to confronting what that choice means—accepting pain of both worlds. The golden-eyed double forces the key decision about humanity versus covenant repair. However, the resolution arrives too easily; pressing the clipping to her heart instantly resolves the fractured covenant without dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate through ritual accumulation: initial bargain → touching skeleton → stitching bones → eating fruit, each deepening commitment with tangible cost. The "fiercely gentle blade to cut through illusion" and vision of "every mistake and triumph woven into a single, flawed whole" demonstrate meaningful pressure, though agency feels slightly guided by the keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—finding purpose after public failure—escalates from cloth discovery through research to the bassist call, with Lenny's emotional walls gradually breaking down. The tightening occurs when he chooses connection over insulation. However, the resolution lacks visible struggle; the phone call succeeds too easily without meaningful opposition or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding the transition between realms—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure builds through Elara's methodical attempts culminating in the seed's opening. However, the escalation lacks external opposition or meaningful trade-offs; the transformation occurs without significant resistance or visible cost beyond intellectual effort.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the woman's choice to shed her identity despite fear, with visible cost in the dissolution/reformation process. The dominant stake of preserving wonder through accepting contradictions manifests concretely, though the child's section doesn't meaningfully deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—dissolving isolation between survivors—is signaled early and escalates through Elias's discovery of the shell's confessions to his decision to place the pearl. The cost is legible (pearl dissolves, Elias is permanently changed), though the resolution's scope (affecting all bunkers simultaneously) somewhat dilutes the personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as each graffiti message forces Mara to confront her stagnant guilt, building to her decision to map her heart instead of rivers. The cost is visible when she abandons her "meticulous, daringly methodical sketches" for something "meandering and messy," though the escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate through pattern recognition as Lira moves from documenting delays to discovering the cyclical cipher to finding the specific shelf. The dominant stake (finding the library of unspoken words) tightens once when the pattern emerges, though agency remains primarily observational rather than forcing difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation occurs through the accumulation of "propagate" across three beats, each revealing different futures, with the violin's strings snapping to mark resolution. The cost appears in "letting ice shards melt into her palms" and the mulberry stain remaining. However, the empire stake never faces concrete pressure—it remains an abstract possibility rather than a live choice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the chip's dimming light, then the pool's cracking surface threatening all preserved echoes. Lirael's agency drives resolution through her unconventional "embellishment" technique. Cost is visible in the pool's near-destruction and her physical exhaustion, though the tightening could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (finding contentment through understanding cycles) is signaled early and deepens when the hairpin's return reframes forgiveness. However, escalation remains gentle—the sister's arrival creates tension but resolves quickly without forcing harder choices. The final realization lacks the pressure that would elevate this score.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from Mira's initial grief through Elias experiencing the cloak's disorienting power to the decisive act of removing specific chimes. The cost manifests in what must be surrendered (the oak chime's "mournful whine") to achieve harmony. Could push harder on what Mira risks by choosing clarity over comfortable haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on teaching vanishing through withholding, with pressure building through Lira's increasing desperation over weeks. The shift from fractal to spiral ripples marks meaningful deepening. However, the conflict lacks visceral cost—Lira's struggle remains somewhat abstract without concrete consequences for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is clear but escalation remains largely internal without concrete pressure points. The figure-eight pattern provides a deepening moment but no genuine reversal or tightening occurs. The resolution comes through contemplation rather than tested choice, and the final walking action somewhat contradicts the stated goal of navigation without movement.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking validation in a dangerous spire to confronting personal history through the fountain's visions, culminating in the choice to recreate his mother's garden. The cost is primarily emotional rather than physical, and while the "mist walking" provides some tension, the spire never truly threatens Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build from external quest (finding the library) to internal recognition (accepting his grief). The key fitting lock "13" creates meaningful coincidence that forces confrontation. Cost is visible in decades of denial, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once inside the library.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: static bursts → fractured timelines → coherent vision → wavelength alignment. The dominant stake (deciphering the prophecy before contraction completes) tightens as understanding deepens. However, the pressure lacks a concrete deadline or visible consequence for failure until the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to confrontation with the void's monsters as whispers become voices and resist naming. The prism's light flaring and monsters solidifying creates meaningful tightening. Cost appears in the "ache of knowing" and newfound weight, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily after the resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of healing the cosmic rift through bell repair escalates through the physical challenge of calibration, with one meaningful tightening when "the bell's cracks widened slightly" threatens failure. Agency manifests through Elias's persistent adjustments despite Marla's skepticism, though the resolution feels somewhat convenient with the synchronization succeeding just as "the last fish was caught."

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from dam inspection to confronting suppressed history through the liqueur label discovery, photograph placement ritual, and the woman's appearance forcing Mara to choose her role. The dominant stake—preserving memory versus letting the past drown—tightens when the woman reveals the dam's failing state creates urgency. Cost becomes visible when Mara places her own photo, accepting guardianship's burden.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on achieving balance before "final transformation," with pressure building through the ritual sequence. The hand-in-flame moment provides clear escalation with visible cost. However, external pressure remains somewhat abstract—the transformation's urgency isn't fully dramatized, limiting the felt immediacy of the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal duty to arbor-wide catastrophe that would destroy "the hidden city below." The lunar phase deadline creates genuine pressure, and each node correction builds toward preventing unraveling. The cost is visible in Kael's physical exhaustion and the risk of failure, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth after establishing such high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are declared (custody battle over existence) and escalation occurs through energy channeling, but the conflict resolution through "merging energies" feels convenient. The clone's resistance ("You'll destroy us both!") creates tension but dissolves too easily. Cost remains conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—solving the seed mystery—is signaled early and tightens through investigation, planting, and the plant's escape. However, escalation lacks genuine pressure; Elias faces no meaningful opposition or cost beyond time and curiosity. The resolution through finding the key feels earned by his methodology but lacks the visible price that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are established early (restoring lost laughter) and pressure builds through Marlowe's physical exhaustion and the tunnel's gradual response. The story shows one meaningful deepening as echoes stir and strengthen. However, the conflict lacks sharp edges - there's no real opposition or risk of failure, just effort against inertia, which limits dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from waiting/watching to confrontation to the choice between power (keeping pendant) and home (destroying it). The cultist's arrival with the revealing lantern tightens pressure, forcing Mara's decision. Her choice to destroy the pendant rather than use it shows clear agency with immediate cost in the cultist's suffering and her lost answers.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from repairing a broken relic to interrupting centuries of stifling destiny, with Kael's realization that "This wasn't about the crozier. It was about him" marking the decisive tightening. The cost is legible (blood drawn, essence poured, permanent scarring) and the successive approximation method creates genuine struggle through trial and error.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through Kael's progressive dismantling of the tower's systems, with each discarded component bringing the hush into sharper focus. The cost manifests in the searing heat of the fragment and the tower's complete transformation, though agency could be tested more severely.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal unease about vanishing commuters to the choice to merge timelines despite knowing it "could unravel reality itself." The dominant stake—completing unfinished journeys—tightens when Kael realizes the hourglass is "a vessel not for sand, but for the echoes of time itself." Cost is visible when the ferry dissolves and Kael stands alone, transformed into a guardian role.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes center on Clara's need to prove logic and magic can coexist, with escalation through the thread's eruption forcing her into the void. The resolution depends on her agency in continuing to weave. However, the curator's convenient explanations and the too-neat return to the gallery reduce earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake of learning to navigate shifting horizons remains consistent but never faces concrete test with visible cost. Tarel's question about changing light patterns introduces mild complication without escalating pressure or forcing trade-offs that would foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (delivering the unspoken message) is clear but escalation is minimal - Lila faces no real opposition or difficult trade-offs. The "pulse" discovery provides mild tightening but there's no moment where she must sacrifice or risk something meaningful. Cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—proving her brother existed beyond a single bubble—establishes early and tightens through rising water that forces immediate action. The tide's turn creates genuine time pressure that narrows options progressively. Cost is visible when Lira must abandon the facility despite her discovery, choosing preservation of proof over further exploration. The escalation follows the accumulative lens coherently, though the final physical escape feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure coheres through OBS-7's demands to "choose" between alive/dead states, building to Elias's decision to defragment for himself rather than the system. The cost is visible in accepting permanent liminality. Some escalation softness in the middle prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest (translating languages) to existential confrontation with oblivion, with the diamond's curse revealed as a mirror of deepest fears. The birds' arrival triggers the climactic test, and the canyon's roaring echoes force her decisive action. Cost is legible when she sacrifices the diamond, though the middle section could tighten pressure between observation and climax.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from observation to participation as the static confessions accumulate pressure, forcing Elara's transformation. The cost is legible—she risks losing her humanity ("how light it felt") but chooses a middle path. One meaningful deepening occurs when she sees the herbalist as "not a guardian but a mirror."

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission to systemic transformation as Lira's music progressively affects the statues' cores. The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in mechanized order—tightens when she discovers the crack and must play "until her fingers bled." Cost is visible in physical pain and the risk of the statues' response, culminating in their destruction and the orchard's chaotic rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—fostering connection across the border's gaps—is signaled early and tested through Elias's risky choice to release the storm. Escalation occurs when the storm transforms passive observation into active wonder, with visible cost in the shattered bottle. However, the conflict resolution relies heavily on the magical storm's unexplained powers rather than character agency driving the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of finding possibility in silence is signaled early and maintained, with one meaningful deepening when the courtyard responds to Elio's song. However, escalation remains gentle—there's no genuine resistance or complication to Elio's quest. The halo fragment discovery and door finding feel frictionless; the story would benefit from obstacles that test his "quietly persistent" nature more rigorously before the transformative moment.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor's need to reawaken dormant stories—is signaled early and deepens through her midnight ritual. The shimmer and rippling floor provide textural escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, no genuine opposition or trade-off emerges; Eleanor achieves her goal without visible price or foreclosed options, and the transformation occurs through discovery rather than costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (capturing the runaway dream) deepens when light "refused to blend" and "pulsed, alive," forcing Elara to confront that she's been the pursued rather than pursuer. Cost is conceptual but legible: "her hand passed through the glow" shows the price of understanding. Escalation through accumulation rather than reversal fits the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing the trapped idea—is signaled early and pressure builds through the unlocking sequence with physical manifestations (trembling, cold, disorientation). The tightening occurs when the locket opens and reality shifts, forcing Elias to bear the woman's secrets as "heavy burden but also profound release." However, the conflict lacks a true oppositional force beyond abstract fear, and the resolution arrives without requiring Elias to make a further choice once unlocked.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: dream fragment → pattern detection → constellation mapping → physical search → discovery, with each layer narrowing Elias's focus toward the fairy ring. The cost registers in his forty-year investment and physical toll ("knees ached"), though the resolution relies somewhat on coincidence rather than pure agency.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (reversing the village's exile/death) is signaled clearly when the woman arrives. Pressure tightens once as Lirael moves from passive archiving to active mentoring, though the escalation feels modest. The cost remains somewhat abstract ("confront what you've avoided") rather than showing specific trade-offs or losses.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake - preserving the orchard's magic - is established early and pressure builds through the ritual sequence. The story delivers one meaningful deepening as Elara performs the essence-capture ritual. However, the resolution lacks genuine opposition or cost; the magic works exactly as intended without complication, and no meaningful option is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of breaking silence to free spirits escalates through the net's unraveling and light eruption, but agency remains limited. Mara follows instructions rather than making difficult choices, and the "hush" breaking lacks concrete opposition or cost beyond her stated fear.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: the 1923 footage dissolves to static, modern footage reveals widened cracks, carvings shift inward "as if guarding a secret." The escalation from archival research to physical descent into darkness carries clear cost, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once he applies holy water.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding loss through physics—deepens through Elara's discoveries, with the transmission revelation forcing a reconceptualization. The conflict is primarily internal but gains texture through the external investigation. The cost is legible in how Elara must confront her mother's absence through Earhart's disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs through ghost-mediated graffiti—progresses through three encoded messages with increasing personal weight. The storm's arrival creates temporal pressure, but the resolution ("maybe, just maybe") deflates rather than crystallizes the accumulated tension, lacking a definitive foreclosure of options.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes escalate from simple cleaning duty to uncovering the captain's death mystery, with the diary and goggles creating progressive revelations. The widow's "You found nothing" creates brief pressure. However, the conflict resolves too easily through mutual understanding without genuine opposition, and Mara faces no real cost for her discoveries or choice to share them.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from professional vindication to personal transformation as Lila's observations intensify from "Cumulus joyus" to "Nimbus iratus." The gondola's lurch and the tower's disappearance tighten pressure, forcing her final choice between proof and belief. Cost is visible in her acceptance of drift over certainty, though the conflict could push harder against her scientific training.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: discovery of indentations → coin alignment → safe opening → journal revelation → demolition beginning. The wrecking ball's first blow forces immediate choice between preserving the painting or saving the safe. Cost visible in abandoning her commissioned work to preserve the guild's true legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from mapping floors to discovering cosmic truth, with the leap as decisive risk. Pressure builds through Jax's discovery, captain's orders, and the narrowing window ("The gap between them widened"). Cost could be more tangible - we see risk but not price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation—from deciphering fragments to finding the specific mirror to unlocking the chest—with each layer adding pressure. However, no significant obstacle or reversal tests Kael's commitment; the quest proceeds smoothly once he identifies the correct mirror, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=4.9)
    The crumbling arches establish stakes but escalation is minimal—settlers simply gather and fix the problem without meaningful obstacles or reversals. No concrete cost is paid; the "hours" of work lack specificity about trade-offs or sacrifice. The resolution arrives through collective effort without dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: glass humming → patterns shifting → memories flooding → lighthouse shuddering → pane cracking. The dominant stake (gentle vs violent apocalypse) faces meaningful deepening when Mara must accept her flaws to complete the task. Cost is visible in the destruction of the puppet head and pane.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from traveler's cry to birds circling to frost forming, with clear time pressure. The "leave impressions without touching" constraint genuinely narrows options. However, the resolution feels predetermined—Kael succeeds without meaningful reversal or cost beyond what the curse already demands.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulation: scientific observation leads to emotional insight, then tentative reconnection, then shared creative work. The text from Mara provides the key tightening moment. Cost is felt in the "shaky harmony" and acknowledgment that the song is "changing" not perfect.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding where stories begin—is signaled early but escalation remains conceptual. The man's request for "a story that hasn't happened yet" deepens the question without forcing a trade-off. Elara's warning about the absence seeking an unwanted shape suggests risk but no actual cost materializes on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate when Nessar moves from tasting wall condensation to entering the forbidden pavilion and finally submerging his hands in dangerous water that makes him experience the founder's crushing guilt. The guard's approaching footsteps add tension, though the resolution through cooking feels insufficiently pressured compared to the pavilion's established danger.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (bridging silence between people) is signaled early but remains largely metaphorical. The conflict lacks concrete opposition - the weight simply "resisted her touch" before yielding to her songs. No meaningful tightening occurs; the resolution arrives through mystical harmony rather than earned struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from technical challenge to psychological risk as "the headband's feedback loop threatened to overwhelm him." The dominant stake - transforming failure into archaeological discovery - tightens when his own painful memories threaten the process. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    The fifty-seven minute deadline creates initial urgency, and gravity inversion provides a meaningful complication that forces adaptation. However, escalation plateaus after the inversion—finding the keys feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle. The stakes of becoming a "keeper of thresholds" lack concrete cost or visible sacrifice at the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through physical cost ("nails bled," "shoulders ached") and the grove's responsive transformation. The dominant stake - proving music exists without sound - faces concrete tests through strumming attempts. The shattering insulator forces a decisive shift from individual creation to communal teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to cosmic covenant renewal through accumulative pressure—stone's glow, hologram appearance, keyhole revelation. The dominant stake (correlating stone with covenant before eclipse) tightens through each discovery. Cost is visible in Alaric's tears and isolation. Deduction for the convenient brass key from Lira and the star-mage's validation feeling slightly unearned despite groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from physical lock-picking through vibration discovery to emotional revelation about grandmother's silence. The firework interruption creates genuine pressure during the humming sequence. Cost becomes visible when Lirael reads entries revealing "lost loves...secrets kept to protect." However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off—understanding arrives without forcing Lirael to sacrifice or choose between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—proving the corpse flower can bring harmony despite elder skepticism—is signaled early but lacks genuine escalation. The seed's dormancy creates mild pressure, resolved through Lira's shift to patience rather than external complication. The elders' opposition never manifests as active obstruction, making the conflict feel static.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - discovering the source of resilience - escalates from observation through navigation to active participation when Lira inserts the arrow tip. The gravity inversion creates temporal pressure, though the actual one-hour constraint could have been tracked more precisely. Cost becomes clear in Lira's shift from potential exploiter to guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulating details—wind patterns, the patch's vibrations, the engineer's discovery—but lacks a decisive moment where Anya must choose or sacrifice something tangible. The revelation lands intellectually but doesn't force her into a corner where the cost becomes undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: silence pools → song seeps → cavern shifts → sculptor transforms. The dominant stake (proving wonder essential) deepens through cascading sensory effects, though the lack of meaningful resistance from Veyra slightly weakens the pressure trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—mastering the flute's true purpose—escalates from playing a melody to confronting past failures to accepting the lesson of unmaking. The broken flute represents genuine loss that forecloses the path of seeking answers through sound. However, the mentor's appearance feels slightly convenient, and the resolution through breaking arrives somewhat abruptly.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Central stake of understanding emotion's mathematics escalates from theoretical experiment to visceral merger that destroys Elias's detachment. The fragment's resistance creates genuine opposition, and the cost is legible when his analytical framework crumbles. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fragment flares and forces empathic merger, though additional intermediate pressure points could strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from courier duty to understanding one's purpose through the mysterious woman's intervention and the seed-planting ritual. The pendant's increasing vibrations create tactile pressure, and Kail's choice to plant despite uncertainty shows agency. However, the resolution lacks a clear trade-off or sacrifice—the transformation feels too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal validation to epistemological crisis as Mara channels emotions through the prism, with the arbor's intensifying response ("amber light," "mist thickening") creating pressure. The shattering glass marks a clear tightening moment, though the resolution's swift acceptance slightly deflates the built tension.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal restoration to village-wide healing, with clear tightening when Mara must sacrifice the beads. The puzzle creates intermediate pressure with pieces vanishing and reappearing. Cost is visible but the middle section's puzzle-solving lacks sufficient resistance before the breakthrough "on a rain-soaked morning."

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (planetary decay) establishes early and escalates through physical trials in the cavern. Cost is legible through blood and pain. However, the confrontation feels somewhat mechanical - Lira appears to explain rather than oppose, reducing genuine conflict pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to confronting the truth about his mother's disappearance, with the shard's pull "overriding his caution" creating genuine pressure. The choice between keeping or discarding the shard carries weight ("the truth was a knife that cut both ways"), though the alternate mother's appearance could have been more dramatically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from practical (fixing the lamp) to existential (maintaining hope without the lighthouse's literal light). The accumulating letters create pressure through their cryptic demands, and Elias's growing investment shows in his daily checking of the window, though the conflict could benefit from one moment of sharper resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal routine to world-shaping responsibility as the shadows reveal "a new dawn...different. Heavier." The progression from adjusting the wick to confronting living shadows to accepting both light and dark provides meaningful deepening. However, the final choice lacks a sharper trade-off; we understand she accepts responsibility but not what specific path she forecloses.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what makes people magnetize stories—intensifies through Lin's heightened post-surgery perception and the wing's dramatic light display. The escalation from private observation to witnessing shared story connection provides meaningful deepening. However, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off or more visceral cost beyond the wing's loss.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    Pressure builds through the accumulation of discoveries but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options. The pin's sound creates tension twice but never forces a choice or trade-off; Elias proceeds through each revelation without confronting resistance or paying a price for his knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen effectively as Lira's humming ignites the forgotten song's power, spreading from child to village to realm. The escalation from individual memory to collective awakening shows clear accumulative pressure, though the opposition remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from Eleanor's initial impulse to hide toward the confrontation with her mother's letters, with clear cost in facing "what you bring" to the blank book. The mirror chamber showing alternate selves deepens pressure effectively, though the resolution relies somewhat on discovered wisdom rather than Eleanor's active choice under maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure builds through accumulation - from noticing decay to finding the tea house to planting seeds to daily tending. The dominant stake (finding sacred in ordinary) deepens when the bread transforms to seed, though the woman's arrival doesn't escalate tension as much as confirm understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—saving the library's knowledge—is signaled early and pressure escalates through fading vows and time constraints ("Not yet"). However, the resolution arrives too easily after one successful reconstruction, without the meaningful tightening or foreclosed option that would demonstrate real cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—preventing the weaponization of trust—escalates through Lira's false starts and tightens at the midnight deadline. The reversal when she discovers her father's voice on the device forces a trade-off between family loyalty and preventing harm. Cost is visible in the destroyed device and cracked fob, though the buyer's escape slightly undermines the resolution's completeness.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why people carry weather—escalates through sensory intensification from lavender to copper/blood taste, forcing Kael's physical retreat. The forests' election provides external pressure that converges with his investigation. Cost is visible when the compass slips from his thumb and his worldview forcibly shifts, though the resolution relies somewhat on Lira's exposition rather than pure dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—confronting suppressed creativity—is established early and maintains coherence. The painting process creates some escalation as "strokes were hesitant at first, then freer," but the conflict lacks genuine resistance or complication. The resolution arrives too smoothly without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs that would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to existential revelation about the city's functioning. The wilting quill creates immediate tension when detecting the keeper's lies, forcing confrontation. The cost—accepting her mother is truly gone while finding meaning in echoes—lands clearly, though the keeper's quick capitulation slightly softens the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a world "drowning in noise"—signals early and develops through the sculpture's creation. Escalation occurs through accumulation (arranging bells, building pendulums, the first performance) but lacks a moment where options genuinely narrow or a price becomes visible. The iceberg's melting provides temporal pressure, yet Elara faces no opposition or trade-off that would force a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    The magnetic shift creates escalating pressure that forces Clara-7's decisive action with the box. The controlled burn represents genuine risk with stakes (overwhelming her systems). Cost is visible in the "fragmented wholeness" achieved—not perfection but balance. The internal conflict between containing and integrating chaos drives meaningful tension, though the external pressure could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (solving the mailbox mystery) is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure builds through accumulating stories, though escalation remains gentle without forcing difficult trade-offs. The resolution arrives through deduction rather than costly choice, limiting the felt stakes despite the emotional resonance of the discovered letters.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual puzzle-solving to life-saving antidote retrieval, with the security drone arrival forcing immediate physical response. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through dance-mimicry. However, the drone defeat feels slightly convenient—their sensors overloading from "chaos of rhythm" lacks sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake (finding deleted memories) is clear but escalation is minimal. The gravity pockets flare once but don't create mounting pressure. Elias's discovery of the memory chamber happens too smoothly—no failed attempts, no cost for accessing it, no choice between competing goods. The resolution grants him both understanding and purpose without requiring sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (preventing cosmic chaos) is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No meaningful escalation occurs—the summoner performs her ritual without opposition, complication, or rising cost. The prophecy threat never manifests concretely on the page, making the resolution feel predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the seal to the revelation of the building's sentient nature, with the meteor shower creating temporal pressure for action. The dominant stake—whether to believe and act on impossible knowledge—tightens as evidence accumulates. However, the actual consequences of speaking to the building remain vague ("somewhere, deep in its walls, a voice answered"), limiting the felt cost of the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming isolation into independence—escalates through the shell ritual where Lirael arranges fragments containing "a laugh, a tear, a whispered goodnight." The cost manifests in the garden's destruction and the "burning but not hurting" sensation. However, the conflict remains largely internal without external pressure, and the resolution's mechanics ("resonance structures flared") lack concrete grounding to fully earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure builds through the accumulation of ritual details—the stolen ink, the thorn's curse, the blood seal—culminating in Lirael's choice to hide rather than deliver the treaty. While the stakes are clear (unraveling empires, breaking cycles of vengeance), the absence of immediate opposition or time pressure limits escalation under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen progressively from personal curiosity to cosmic responsibility as Kael learns echoes are "memories trapped in stone." The hooded figure's revelation forces Kael to accept his role as keeper of lost stories, though the opposition could be more visceral. Cost becomes clear in his acceptance of this eternal burden.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—revealing the sailor's truth to heal fractured relationships—is signaled early and deepens through each dream revelation. The progression from child's innocence to son's guilt to widow's grief creates meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens. However, Kael faces no real opposition or cost to his gift; the resolution feels too smooth without visible price for bridging worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—appreciating hidden effort—progresses through Kael following the whistle, discovering the firefly code, and using the whisk to trace their rhythm. However, escalation remains gentle without meaningful tightening; no option is foreclosed, no price paid beyond time spent observing.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from investigating disappearance to preventing world-ending catastrophe. The flawed diamond as decoy creates genuine reversal that reframes prior understanding. Mara's agency drives the resolution with visible cost - sacrificing the diamond to save the world. Pressure coheres through discovery sequence leading to forced choice.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - decoding prophetic frequencies to shape humanity's future - is signaled early and deepens through accumulation. The storm intensifies, the radio messages grow clearer, and Kael's understanding crystallizes. However, escalation lacks visceral pressure; the transformation feels predetermined rather than fought for, missing the resistance that would make the cost tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - transforming silence into connection - escalates from private experimentation to public performance with emotional payoff. The music box's initial resistance then sudden animation provides one meaningful turn. However, the resolution feels somewhat easy; the transformation from failed poet to successful sound-keeper lacks sufficient resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from protecting the key to confronting the ghost to understanding harmony as solution, with one meaningful reversal when sonic attack becomes sonic bridge. Cost appears through physical exhaustion and the weight of ongoing vigilance, though the ghost's capitulation feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through failed attempts forcing Kael to abandon haste for patience, with visible cost in his aching back and exhaustion. The dominant stake of unyoking power through patience rather than force is tested through concrete action, though the arrival of approving elders reduces tension rather than heightening final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—breaking free from Cole's control—signals early and escalates when Mara discovers the "Eliminate" files proving systematic murder. The lantern visions of Eliza provide historical parallel that deepens the stakes. However, Cole's absence as an on-page antagonist limits immediate pressure, and the resolution lacks a concrete test where Mara must pay a visible price for her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether broken lives can be repaired—escalates from Marcus's skepticism through seeing the clockwork heart to his final commitment. The storm's arrival coinciding with his decision provides textural pressure. Cost becomes visible when Marcus accepts the weight of facilitating redemption for those who've done terrible harm.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual puzzle to physical risk as Lira launches into "sulfurous wind" with "gears screaming." The kaleidoscope visions narrow options progressively (crashed glider → embedded arrow → necessary collision). The final dive with the arrow tip as "conductor's baton" shows clear agency driving toward irreversible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal investigation to corporate conspiracy to physical confrontation. The dominant stake - uncovering truth despite corporate suppression - drives every beat. The pressure tightens when Hale arrives with drones, forcing Lira's choice. The cost becomes tangible as she abandons her position to become a fugitive, though the immediate physical danger could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—quieting a fear-storm through empathy—is signaled early and pressure builds through the mirror sequence. Each vision (sailor, mother, lover) tightens the emotional accumulation toward transformation. However, the resolution lacks a clear trade-off or foreclosed option; Elara succeeds without visible personal cost beyond the effort of weaving empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Lila's journey between death-seeking and life-saving—develops through accumulative pressure. The rescue provides meaningful deepening as she acts "when the moment called" despite coming for opposite reasons. The cost is primarily internal/emotional rather than external, appropriate for this textural approach but lacking the visceral edge of higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Lila's creative/emotional numbness—is signaled early but escalation remains gentle conversation rather than mounting pressure. Elias's philosophical nudging about sun/moon mismatches and vineyard metaphors doesn't tighten options or force trade-offs; the resolution arrives through persuasion without visible cost or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving the echo of wisdom—is signaled early but remains static throughout. The consecration proceeds without meaningful opposition or cost; the prophet's arrival enables rather than complicates. No tightening occurs; the ritual unfolds as planned without forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (transmuting pain into art) is signaled early but lacks meaningful tightening or deepening. No real pressure forces difficult choices—Lila simply observes, sketches, and decides to photograph without opposition or cost. The dove's appearance is coincidental rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain internal and abstract—Elias needs to "decode the pattern of growth" but faces no opposition or time pressure. The conflict centers on intellectual discovery without concrete consequences for failure. No meaningful escalation occurs; the crystal's appearance doesn't tighten options or force trade-offs. The vague mention of dismissive colleagues provides insufficient external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (capturing the sound of growing older) signals early and tightens through failed attempts and adjusted markers. The pressure coheres under accumulative lens as fog shifts, visions slip away, and physical exhaustion builds. Cost appears in accepting fragments over wholeness, though the middle section could show more distinct pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to harness or surrender to temporal chaos—emerges clearly but escalation relies heavily on external phenomena (tremors, portal appearance) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. The clock's acceleration provides mechanical tension but Elias's actual choices remain limited to technical responses until the final leap.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional duty to personal resonance as Elias reminds Mira of her mother. The tightening occurs through Elias's progression from silence to singing to death. Cost is visible through Clara's grief and Mira's emotional response. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from academic curiosity through three nights of research to the critical astronomical window. The "spoons bent reality" event creates urgency and mystique. However, no clear cost or trade-off appears when Lirael succeeds - the revelation comes without sacrifice or narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from Mara's intellectual curiosity to emotional confrontation when Elias appears, forcing her to risk both understanding and reconciliation. The tooth placement creates genuine tension with uncertain outcome. However, the resolution comes somewhat easily once both teeth are placed—the garden's immediate forgiveness lacks sufficient resistance to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—creating and sharing captured starlight—progresses through polishing, weighing, and release. Escalation reads as density increase and pattern accumulation fitting the textural lens. The cost is visible when Elara releases the pearl she worked to create.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: pendant revelation → moss grafting → sapling planting. The stake of processing grief through transformation deepens when Elias suggests "expanding his story" rather than losing it. Cost becomes tangible in accepting impermanence: "It'll outgrow this place someday."

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation occurs through accumulation—from dock to nexus interior, from fragment to key, from resistance to acceptance. The cost manifests in Clara destroying her "neat resolution," though the middle section with the guide-figure reduces agency. Stakes tighten adequately but lack the visceral pressure that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the arbor's fading magic—signals early and escalates from preparation through ritual to community commitment. However, the resolution comes too easily; the tendril works perfectly on first attempt without meaningful resistance or complication. The shift from "magic needs tenders, not just tinkerers" provides the one meaningful deepening, though cost remains abstract beyond physical exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of capturing/sealing starlight progresses through accumulative ritual steps with one meaningful deepening when the plate begins to hum and respond. However, the resolution lacks visible cost—Elias succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. The three previous failures are mentioned but don't create present pressure or force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as Elias uncovers the timer's hidden complexities—from scattered gears to micro-etchings to final harmonic resonance. The "wounded season" provides temporal pressure, and his daily returns show commitment cost, though the conflict lacks a decisive reversal or moment where failure feels imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from thorns (cooperative) to obsidian (resistant) to mother's locket (refused), each requiring recalibrated technique. The "crack split the stone, a sound like a heart breaking" delivers visceral cost. Agency drives all choices under the accumulative lens, though the final refusal could land with sharper immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - transforming grief into something tangible - deepens through the carving process. The tightening occurs as Clara moves from avoidance to tentative cuts to completed lion. However, there's minimal resistance or complication; the carving proceeds too smoothly without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—Veyra's need to negotiate with her ghost about forgiveness—escalates through the camera wheel discovery to the confrontation where she drops it into the lagoon. The ghost's challenge ("where's the courage to let go?") forces her choice with visible cost in her departure/dissolution. However, the pressure could be more acute, and the transformation mechanism remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake of proving "fractured systems could be redirected" is signaled early and tested when Lila recalibrates the terminal's systems. The escalation from finding the sextant to activating dormant infrastructure shows agency, but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options—she achieves her goal without sacrificing alternatives or facing genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: from petrichor intrusion to the bear's paradoxical presence to the forecourt's unexpected song, each element reweights Lira's relationship to silence and wildness. The cost is legible in her acceptance that "the keep's gears had kept her safe, but they had also kept her small."

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from general legend-seeking to understanding "the architecture of lies" through the sundial's guidance to the warehouse discovery. The tightening from abstract quest to concrete blueprint provides one meaningful turn, but lacks visible cost—Elias faces no real opposition or sacrifice in obtaining his revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from decoding knots to understanding the weavers' true nature, with the fulgurite glass enabling progression through each knot's revelation. The woman's appearance provides external pressure, though the resolution lands more as philosophical acceptance than a choice with tangible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake - understanding absence through the vanished woman's story - is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation. The spectral encounter provides atmosphere but no genuine resistance or complication; Elara simply observes and writes without facing obstacles or making difficult choices. The resolution arrives through passive reception rather than earned struggle, with cost remaining abstract rather than dramatically tested.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in the mechanical world—is clear from the start. Escalation occurs through the egg's increasing responsiveness culminating in hatching. However, agency feels limited as Corvin mostly observes rather than makes decisive choices. The appearance of Thalos deflates tension rather than heightening it, and the resolution feels too smooth after the buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—proving transformation is possible—escalates through the bird-healing challenge and Mara's fear of loss. Cost becomes visible when Lira must confront her father's legacy directly ("But I'm not him") and when Mara releases the bird. The pressure coheres but could tighten further; the family's arrival feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation as each found object intensifies the box's hum from gentle pulse to sharp cutting sound. The dominant stake—freeing trapped memories—faces genuine resistance requiring physical cost ("fingers scraped raw"). However, the conflict lacks a true reversal or complication; the progression feels predetermined despite the earned final effort.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reconciling the Enclave's rejection of fire with Lumin's belief in healing light—intensifies through the ghost's revelation about violence versus gentleness. The sonar pinging creates urgency and the gear's calculations suggest possibility, building to Lumin's choice. However, the conflict lacks visceral opposition; the ghost provides answers too readily without forcing Lumin to struggle for understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake of discovering "the shape of collective grief" progresses through accumulative visits and family stories. The butterfly migration provides temporal pressure and symbolic weight. Cost becomes visible in Marlow's confrontation with his own unspoken losses, though the spectral mentorship reduces some agency in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    The Hush creates coherent pressure with clear escalation from stalled pendulum to ridge cracking to potential chaos. Stakes are embodied through physical details (ridge shuddering, obsidian cracking). However, the resolution comes too easily—pressing palm and whispering words immediately restarts the pendulum without sufficient struggle or cost beyond "raw hands."

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation as each thread reveals deeper meaning - from stars to chess knight to the phrase about silence. The dominant stake of understanding the dead's intentions tightens, though the final revelation lacks a sharper cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—breaking the village's perpetual winter through predictive modeling—signals early and escalates through Lira's persistent work against skepticism. The thaw represents meaningful change with visible consequences (farming, children playing). Cost manifests through physical toll (cramped hands, bloodshot eyes) and the burned journals. The conflict could deepen if the Elders posed more active opposition beyond verbal dismissal.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on Lira's quest to recover lost stories, with pressure building through the elusive broadcast signals that "flickered in and out of existence." The story deepens through accumulating fragments ("The dust remembers," "The wind carries secrets") but lacks a meaningful tightening that would foreclose options or force a trade-off with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on Lira's attempt to capture "the ache of longing, the sting of betrayal" against the gallery's entropic nature, with Elias providing mild oppositional pressure ("You're chasing ghosts"). The conflict deepens through acceptance rather than escalation, though the emotional stakes could intensify more sharply through the creation process.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central conflict—preserving ancient methods versus pragmatic survival—establishes clear stakes, but escalation stalls. Mara's challenge prompts Elias to dig deeper and align artifacts, but this action doesn't meaningfully tighten options or force trade-offs. The ending ("she didn't leave") suggests change without demonstrating cost or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake of preserving vanishing arts against cultural hatred is signaled early and maintained. Elias's arrival with the matching violin motif creates one meaningful tightening that forces Clara to risk harmony despite "knowing the risk." However, escalation stalls after their duet—the expansion to full choir happens through summary ("Clara invited others") rather than dramatized pressure, and no concrete cost materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the pruning sequence—from traumatic memories to gentle ones—with each cut narrowing the plant's potential path. The celestial alignment provides temporal pressure, though the conflict lacks a moment where Elara might genuinely fail or pay a steeper price.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring collective wonder to save the city's power—escalates from personal observation to public action with clear cost. Clara's shift from passive keeper to active catalyst shows agency, and the city's disbelief creates genuine pressure. The resolution feels slightly mechanical in how quickly the city responds to her speech, reducing tension at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—gets established but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The ritual proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or meaningful choice under pressure. While the accumulative arrangement builds toward the sanctification moment, there's no tightening of options or forced trade-off that would create dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (saving the ocean from blight) is signaled early and escalates through the pedestal challenge. The structural weakness discovery forces a specific tactical approach. However, the resolution comes somewhat easily once the ampoule is found - drinking it involves minimal struggle or trade-off beyond implied transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing the texture of loss through perpetual motion—deepens through accumulation: dice tests, mathematical proofs, and the rupture experiment. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as density increases toward the climactic rupture that creates the orbital dance, though the middle section could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—deepens through Mr. Voss's arrival and recognition of his mother. The shift from painting alone to learning together represents meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in tears and 97 hours without sleep, though could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal frustration ("voice had frayed") through communal loss (vanished bees, dying arts) to active intervention (festival planning, teaching children). The spring thaw creates temporal pressure that forces action. Cost registers in the beekeeper's absence and Lila's resolve hardening against loss, though middle sections could tighten the pressure between preservation and practice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from initial stone examination through failed first attempt ("the light vanished") to successful mercury-coil modification that feeds the stone's hunger. The protagonist's agency drives each attempt through reverse-engineering choices. The tightening occurs when Elias must innovate beyond his father's design, though the final triumph lacks immediate trade-off or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from entering the funhouse to confronting the shadow to gripping its burning thread. The paradoxical solution (welcoming what repulses) creates meaningful reversal with visible cost. However, Vey's role as whispering guide reduces some agency, and the shadow's dissolution feels slightly mechanical despite the physical price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as density increase under the Accumulative lens - from flat lifeless sound to rich resonance to full orchestration with apples and seabirds. The dominant stake (transforming chaos into harmony) tightens when the driftwood groans "under the strain," forcing higher stakes. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and the faded mallet patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to city-wide catastrophe as Lira's investigation triggers the shells' awakening. The pattern language discovery leads to the tunnel opening, which reveals her mother's warning, culminating in the shells cracking open with seawater. Cost is visible in the city's destruction, though the watchers' agency could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rosebush deadline creates urgency, and the tunnel discovery deepens stakes from exposing lies to understanding survival compromises. The revelation about delayed war (not prevented) meaningfully tightens options—Elara must now decide how to frame this complex truth. Cost is visible in the final choice to present "cautionary parallels" rather than simple heroic narrative, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from mapping erosion to discovering personal/familial connection, with the hidden chamber providing meaningful escalation. The drawbridge's isolation creates temporal pressure. However, the discovery lacks opposition or trade-off - Elara gains connection without sacrificing anything tangible, limiting the cost's visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from cataloging knowledge to uncovering buried truth to accepting responsibility for sharing it. The vault discovery tightens pressure, and finding Elara's journal forces Lira to confront the city's self-destruction through lies. Cost is visible in the "heavy" truth and isolation of the long swim home, though the final confrontation could press harder.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on transforming grief through craft, with one meaningful deepening as the protagonist shifts from trying to outrun darkness to transforming it—"The shadow wasn't something to flee—it was something to transform." The confrontation with the returning shadow tests this realization with visible cost in the "trembling fingers" and emotional price of holding the painful memories, though escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation through circuit breaker countdown creating time pressure, Elara's choice to override safety protocols, and the node's expansion "devouring the crater." The cost is legible (observatory destroyed, complete isolation) though the final transformation's stakes could be sharper. One meaningful tightening through her decision to enter the unstable node despite warnings.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding and assembling the matrix chip to decode belonging—is signaled early and tightens when Lira must trust the pilgrim's guidance about stellar alignment. The lever-pulling moment forecloses other options and commits to this specific method. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost; the "resonance" discovery feels abstract rather than carrying the weight of what Lira risks or loses in this pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from questioning Lila's request to discovering family erasure to choosing truth over comfortable lies. The driftwood revelations tighten pressure—each carving narrows Elias's options toward inevitable disclosure. Cost is legible but could be sharper; we see potential consequences (Lila's reaction) rather than immediate price. The "sieved hush" must be broken despite professional risk.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on the prisoner exchange with personal details (terrified son, eight-year-old daughter), but the exchange itself lacks complication—it goes smoothly without testing Clara's philosophy. The drawer pull creates internal pressure about carrying versus releasing mistakes. Escalation remains modest; the storm arrives but doesn't force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from external navigation to internal reckoning as the compass reveals itself as a "measure of regret." The lighthouse climb and decision to leave the compass create meaningful tightening. Cost is legible in her acceptance that "chaos...was indifferent" and choosing to navigate without anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering empathy after neural reset—is clear, and pressure builds through the descent and lake immersion. The revelation of alternate lives provides meaningful deepening that changes Mara's understanding. However, J.T.'s appearance lacks sufficient resistance, and the resolution comes too easily without forcing harder choices or visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from reluctance through creature offerings to physical transformation, with each element (fox feather, obsidian shard, willow-whispers) tightening pressure toward metamorphosis. The cost—losing human form to maintain the phoenix bond—is explicit, though agency wavers slightly when she "let the spice-scent carry her."

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from seeking prophecy to finding the mother's voice in the saucer's crack to climbing the time-tree to witnessing the reversed city. The dominant stake—reconciling with maternal absence—deepens when Elara realizes she's been waiting in the wrong way. Cost manifests in the saucer healing and the glade's dissolution, foreclosing return.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Central stake (ship's survival requiring Lira to confront her shadow) escalates from avoidance through forced engagement to transformation. The cost is visible—she must abandon her pacifist stance of non-engagement and face painful memories. The tightening works: ship shudders → locket dims → must act now. Slightly mechanical in places but achieves meaningful pressure that forecloses her avoidance path.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding transformation—deepens through the man's revelation that Lira has been "fulfilling prophecies accidentally," forcing her to reconsider her entire approach. The cost is legible in her years of misguided effort. However, the man's disappearance reduces agency at the crucial moment, and escalation could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal puzzle-solving to network activation as Kieran and Elara decode the sundial together. The blackout as "test" raises pressure, forcing action before lights return. The tightening from individual vigilance to collective revolution lands, though the Council remains abstract opposition without immediate counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through mathematical sequences (Fibonacci to Pascal's to Möbius) with each attempt raising stakes through increasingly dangerous visions. The storm threat provides coherent pressure, though the resolution's ease slightly undercuts the established danger.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to write censored safety or raw truth—escalates through the storm's intensification and the cartographer's revelatory poem. The cost becomes visible when Kael seals his uncensored work for mailing. The conflict could tighten further if the Ministry's threat were more immediate rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation operates through accumulating philosophical stakes rather than physical danger—from "questions meant to be answered" versus "traveled" to the revelation that "the duel wasn't about victory; it was about translation." The blood drawn marks physical cost, though the transformation to collaboration feels slightly abrupt given the competitive setup.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Cedar's struggle with identity fragmentation—intensifies through the molting scene where "his mind fracturing and reforming" forces a crystallized stance. The cost is visceral: "felt the shift like an earthquake." The friendship with Marla provides secondary pressure that deepens rather than distracts.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: from escape seeking to cage recognition to active search for refuge, culminating in the discovered room. The dominant stake (finding artistic freedom beyond "strategic creativity") tightens when Clara descends the hidden stairs, though middle-beat pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (preserving collective memory before monsoon) escalates through Lira's doubt-test when she questions whether memory is "worth protecting." The tightening occurs when she must choose between "fear and courage" after seeing dual futures. However, the antagonistic pressure (the fracture) remains somewhat abstract, and the resolution through seed-dissolution feels slightly convenient despite being earned.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - finding what the father "never said" - drives the action and resolves with visible emotional cost. However, escalation is limited; once the lace-weaving begins, the path to resolution is straightforward without meaningful reversals or complications that would deepen pressure.

    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (using the vial, following the trail) under the accumulative lens. The stake deepens through a meaningful cadence shift at the pool, with visible cost in the emotional surge. No coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Causal lens, escalation is driven by Elara's agency: her decision to use the fragment triggers the garden's reaction, which narrows her options and overwhelms her, forcing the climactic choice to press on. The cost is unmistakable: the disintegration of the bridge and her visions. The dominant stake (discovering time's texture) is tested and ultimately reweighted by her actions. A minor deduction as the final cost, while felt, is slightly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens; the approaching scavengers create coherent pressure that tightens options.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by the accumulative pressure of the thaw, which reveals first the bookmark's crack and then the hidden compartment. Kael's agency—his decision to narrate, to re-examine the bookmark—directly leads to the discovery. The cost is the conceptual shift from seeking perfection to embracing fracture, made legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the causal lens, pressure escalates cleanly from discovery to decryption to confrontation. Lila's agency in outwitting the enforcer and later confronting her mother narrows options and forces trade-offs. The cost is legible in her refusal to relinquish the shell, proving her newfound power through vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the accumulative lens: each summarized silence deepens the stakes.

One meaningful intensification is sufficient, though the pressure could compound more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is masterful under the causal lens; the stakes shift from simple curiosity to comprehending the nature of thought and time itself. The protagonist's agency is paramount in driving the escalation, from investigating the violin to choosing to step through the temporal door. The cost of its newfound, isolating clarity is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift—the discovery of the message and the subsequent meeting with Lira—which reweights the dominant stake of truth versus record-keeping.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens: Joren's skepticism introduces pressure, and Elara's demonstration forces a tactical choice. The cost is legible in Joren's adoption of her method and the maze's responsive change. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: Veyra's overcompensation creates the destabilization, and her recalibration earns the resolution. The cost is legible in the creatures' thrashing and her sweat. One meaningful tightening (the flicker) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive intensification through the discovery of the code and the final surge of water. The dominant stake (proving the ghost's existence) is tested and deepened, narrowing Clara's options to a single, costly vow. The cost is felt in the loss of the physical program, cementing her commitment. The surge is a coherent environmental pressure that forces her stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a density increase of doubt and discovered evidence, culminating in the discovery of the "QUARANTINE" folder.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly the nurturing of wonder versus skepticism. Escalation is driven by the accumulating pressure of the eclipse and Elara’s deliberate actions, culminating in Mara’s choice to accept the curl and its meaning. The cost is her altered worldview, made visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the accumulative lens, with probing diaries and deciphering tapestry letters tightening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure escalates through a cadence shift (the child's question, the thaw) that deepens the dominant stake (saving the arts) and reweights Lila's options. The cost of the beekeeper's absence is a quiet, felt price. The escalation is coherent but could be more pronounced.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens. The initial failure raises the stakes, forcing a more desperate, inventive attempt. The cost is legible in the stone's deepened hunger and the island's shuddering transformation, narrowing options to a single path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Mara's agency under the causal lens, with one meaningful tightening (confronting the shadow) and clear cost (seared hand). The dominant stake (breaking the curse) is tested and resolved with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven entirely by Leeward's agency under the accumulative lens, as she layers sound upon sound, each attempt narrowing her options and raising the physical cost. The stake—mending the circle—is signaled early and tested by the "rogue current" backstory. The cost is unmistakable: "her arms ached, but she kept dubbing." A single, meaningful intensification from a flat sound to a blooming, resonant "cello's cry" is sufficient and powerfully executed.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds masterfully through a series of discoveries that deepen Lira's knowledge and narrow her options. The dominant stake (survival/understanding) is clear and escalates to an existential threat. The cost is legible in the final image of the city breaking apart. A point is deducted as the initial inciting incident (the gate rusting shut) is reported, not shown, slightly lessening the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (rescuing truth) escalate through protagonist agency: Elara chooses to follow Tomas's clue and explore the tunnel, leading to a decisive tightening of options. The cost is legible in her reconfigured understanding—the lie was a "bridge, not a barrier"—which reweights her mission and the historical narrative she must now write.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive intensification: the groaning sound disrupts the quiet reverie, forcing a new, riskier action (opening the hatch). This narrows options and deepens the mystery, raising the stakes from personal reflection to tangible discovery. The cost is the vulnerability and effort of the act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Causal lens, from investigating the groan to decoding the door. The dominant stake (seeking truth) tightens meaningfully with the vault's discovery. The cost of the revealed truth is legible and reweights the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation is driven by her agency under the Accumulative lens: polishing the gem deepens the stakes, and her decision to confront the shadow reweights the conflict. Cost is felt in the "luminous torment" and the shadow's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes are clear from the first line. Escalation is driven entirely by Elara's agency under the causal lens, her refusal to abort forcing the system to its breaking point. The cost is unmistakable: the destruction of the observatory and the permanent, dangerous transformation of the protagonist. The final, charged image of her walking toward new nodes confirms the stakes have been irrevocably raised.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is driven by Lira's agency: she tracks the pilgrim, uses her drone, and ultimately pulls the lever. The stakes are clear and tighten meaningfully, culminating in the reconfiguration of her goal from a physical object to a resonance. The cost is the foreclosing of a simple answer, though it could be more viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: each carved discovery tightens the stake and forecloses the option of lying. The cost of truth-telling is legible and charges the final image. One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Clara’s agency under the Accumulative lens, as her revelation about the cartographer’s innocence and her final choice to discard the pull constitute a meaningful cadence shift. The cost is legible in the final image of the object vanishing into the mist. A minor deduction for the external exchange itself feeling somewhat peripheral to the central internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Clara’s accumulating realizations under the accumulative lens, culminating in the decisive choice to leave the compass. The cost is felt on the page through her renunciation of old navigation methods. Agency is clear, though the pressure is more internal and reflective than externally causal, which fits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (relearning empathy) is signaled early and escalates coherently under the Causal lens. The lake scene provides a meaningful, agency-driven tightening, forcing Mara to confront her unchosen lives and foreclosing the path of pure erasure. The cost is felt in the loss of the maternal reflection. The escalation is driven by her choice to wade into the water.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens—her decision to sing and then not fight the change. The cost is legible on the page in her physical transformation and the redefinition of her identity, though the initial refusal could apply slightly more tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a cadence shift and density increase that reweights the dominant stake of lost time. The pressure coheres through the wind, the card reveals, and the saucer's crack widening, forcing Elara's stance crystallization. The cost is felt in her climb and the final, charged image, though the agency in the final choice is slightly passive.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the causal lens: the ship's decay forces Lira's confrontation. The dominant stake (dimensional integrity/survival) is clear, and the cost of her choice (shattering the locket) is legible. A single meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift triggered by the stranger's revelation, which reweights Lira's entire life's work and the dominant stake of understanding change. The cost is the foreclosing of her old, tidy "fixing" mindset, made visible in her altered perception of the world. Agency is her choice to listen and accept the new jar.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: the blackout as a test forces a tactical choice to use the quill holder, which meaningfully tightens options and leads to the discovery. The cost is legible in the risk of Council retaliation. A single, well-executed tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Lira's sequenced attempts, each narrowing her options under the accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the blinding star dust and the terror of the "howling void" vision, forcing her final, costly stance shift from control to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by the accumulating pressure of the storm and the revelation of the poem, which deepens Kael's understanding and forces his stance crystallization. The dominant stake (artistic freedom vs. censorship) is tested and reweighted with a clear, felt cost—the physical risk of sending the poem. The final choice is an active, agential response to the coherent, intensifying pressure. A slight deduction as the external storm's threat remains largely atmospheric, not concretely narrowing his options.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the Hybrid lens: Kael's manipulation of the tin card creates a decisive turn that recontextualizes the conflict from physical to philosophical. The stakes evolve intelligibly from winning a duel to achieving mutual understanding. The cost of this shift is Kael's disarming and the thin line of blood, making the trade-off palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through a decisive intensification: the tin feels heavier, and the new poem forces a conceptual deepening. The dominant stake of self-preservation/understanding is clear. Agency is demonstrated through Cedar's choice to write and reinterpret his mantra. The cost is felt in the final, fragile image of something blooming against the indifferent city.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation under the Accumulative lens is a decisive cadence shift: Clara's trance turns cagey, prompting her to act (playing the piano, projecting the film). This deepening reweights the dominant stake of seeking refuge, culminating in her descent. The cost is her surrender to unplanned creation, a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate through a single, meaningful deepening in the dream sequence. Lira's agency drives the escalation ("Show me the fracture"). The cost of choosing courage over fear is legible, though the felt price of the choice is slightly conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: the act of stitching the lace deepens the stakes and narrows options, leading to the decisive rowing out. The cost of the unspoken apology is legible and felt. A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient and well-executed.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on identity and method: continue cosmic work or risk reputation by pursuing “trivial” dust. Pressure tightens via the institute’s call, the chrysalis’ unexpected patterns, and public exposure at the symposium, with visible social cost. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A single decisive narrowing (choosing to present this work) carries the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: deciphering an ephemeral map before it vanishes, crawling a narrowing crevice, and confronting an identity pivot. The meaningful tightening is the chamber discovery that narrows her options to a values choice. Cost is present but subtle, more vocational than existential. No antagonist on page, but internal/external threads interweave effectively at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (prove silence can sing) is clear and tightens via the on‑page experiments and the lullaby alignment. Escalation is credible but gentle; risk or loss isn’t sharply foregrounded in the key beats, and options don’t visibly narrow beyond technique‑honing. The visitors’ arrival adds recognition pressure, but little jeopardy. The cost remains largely internal and retrospective rather than acutely paid in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (revive the city’s signal vs. Elias’s resistance to reviving) is clear and coheres. Escalation occurs via the decision to repair and the activation, but we lack a meaningful setback or costful trade‑off in scene beyond endurance and labor. The tightening is present yet gentle; danger or time pressure never truly narrows options. The resolution arises from Elias’s agency, though the price is largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (community survival vs fear/anonymity) is clear and escalates through Mira’s risky public naming. The visible price—loss of donations—forces a tactical shift to reciprocal notes. Pressure is coherent under a causal/situational lens, though on‑page pushback at the bell scene is muted, reducing friction. Still, the turn is protagonist‑driven and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible from the outset, and escalation deepens via chosen risk (taking the Tear) and method (breath revealing the path, then activating the pool). Pressure remains inward and lyrical, with limited visible price. The tightening is sufficient for this length, though the resolution’s cost reads more as serene repricing than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (unlocking/stabilizing time) is signaled early and escalates to a decisive intensification as the garden and memories come apart. Agency drives turns: she places and then presses the fragment, actively “pulling threads.” The cost is legible (tool spent, visions gone), though pressure could tighten earlier with a shaper trade‑off moment. Still, the single decisive escalation suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: unlock the vault before scavengers, preserve resilience. Pressure tightens as footsteps approach, narrowing options and prompting the costly choice to shatter a vial. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (wall’s collapse drawing scavengers) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The price is legible and alters future options.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via a purposeful tightening: the initial mix isn’t enough, forcing the sharper choice to desecrate the dead tree’s root. The eruption’s pain and sonic overload test commitment and exact a price. Agency drives each turn; no coincidence resolves anything. The narrowing is modest but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (steal the jar) is clear, and the key tightening arrives when the jar “warns,” forcing a real trade. The cost (abandoning the photograph; sacrificing the lily) registers. Escalation is muted by frictionless obstacles (sleeping guard, off‑stage pressure floor), so tension plateaus between entry and offering. Still, the internal/external hinge is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is coherent (recover blueprint; protect inquiry) and tightens when the thaw accelerates to expose the schematic. Escalation is quiet but clear; internal and external threads interweave at the reveal. The price—letting go of the quest for “perfect answers”—is modest yet meaningful. Absence of sharper external pressure keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is survival/control of the heirloom’s leverage, signaled early. Pressure tightens with the armed enforcer’s arrival; Lila’s choice to use the decrypted notes cracks his composure, then she commits to escape. Costs are present but mostly implied (risk of being shot, later boundary with her mother). The decisive deepening is strong; the resolution’s external consequence occurs off‑page.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates through a live clock (one star), deepening hush, and bodily cost (aching fingers), culminating as the star winks out. The tightening arises from her chosen method—each captured silence advances the spiral toward a poised end. Stakes are internal, so the price feels subtle rather than drastic. Still, the cadence shift at the end reweights options convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering where thoughts come from—is signaled and pursued. Pressure deepens via the temporal loop and meetings with self‑variants, culminating in the weaving act. However, resistance is low and solutions arrive smoothly; consequence reads more reflective than costly. The tightening is present but gentle rather than exacting.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will Elias accept a truth‑based, wordless mode—tightens as he uses the lens, confronts Lira, and commits to decoding through the night. The walk‑through decoding sequence is a credible deepening rather than a mere montage. The resolution is driven by his stance crystallization (not writing), but the price is soft, with minimal visible loss or risk. A sharper trade‑off on the page would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (human intuition vs algorithmic maze) is signaled early and tested once during the path shift. The sensor block is the meaningful turn, but escalation remains low and risk minimal; no option is foreclosed with a felt price. Joren’s skepticism dissolves without hard pushback, reducing pressure. Quiet tension fits the lens, yet stakes never bite.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (prove time’s sideways motion without losing control) is clear and escalates with the nexus flicker. The tightening beats (urgent “Recalibrate! Now!” and rerouting through secondary coils) are earned and protagonist-driven. The price feels modest—no lasting loss or foreclosed path—so the final image is charged but not searing. Tension runs well at sentence and beat scales.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake (decoding/proving the ghost) escalates through environmental pressure and loss of the program. The key tightening is the pipe burst that removes a resource and forces a new tactic (memory and commitment). The price is legible but largely implied rather than dramatized with a direct counterforce. Still, the vow is an earned stance crystallization under rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (truth vs institutional denial/self‑preservation) is clear; pressure tightens with the file’s reveal and culminates in leaving. The escalation is primarily internal, but the external beat (quarantine evidence) credibly forces stance. Lack of on‑page confrontation trims edge, yet the renunciation reads earned with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (unearth the buried truth), with one strong tightening (activating the intake/shaft → descent → panel activation → reveal). Agency drives the escalations; the price is a reweighted burden and renunciation rather than a hazardous tactical trade-off. Stakes are more epistemic than survival, but tension holds at sentence and beat levels.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around reaching the refuge and renouncing judgment, tightening through thresholds (slick tunnel, root fissure, groaning stairs, reflective pool, rusted door). The reflection beat is the clearest price point and narrowing of options; the library’s resistance (“as if the library itself resisted”) adds mild external pressure. Cost is internal but felt, and the return reconfigures stakes. Slight softness remains in the absence of a sharper trade‑off or external consequence beyond identity loosening.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—will wonder be rekindled—tightens as light dwindles to totality and Mara consents to “allow.” The glow is a meaningful deepening that reweights skepticism. The price is chiefly internal, with low external friction; tension is gentle but sustained. Resolution grows from the characters’ choices rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring the axis from ignoring to hearing—is signaled and deepens through patterned discoveries. The meaningful tightening occurs when the embroidered letters are decoded, reweighting all prior detail. Agency is attention/recognition rather than confrontation, appropriate to the lens. The on-page price is more conceptual than visceral, reducing peak intensity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (whether to assume the network’s power) is signaled early and tightens with the discovery of the letters. The escalation beat—reframing the fortunes as keys—deepens stakes credibly. Still, the price she pays is mostly deferred; no on‑page loss or hard trade‑off tests her resolve. Tension is steady but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unravel stillness before the possession completes—is signaled early and escalates as loops accumulate and the anchor destabilizes. A meaningful tightening occurs at the crack/void expansion; his choice to persist through paradox rather than brute force earns the outcome. Cost is conceptual and systemic rather than intimate, but it’s present. The conflict never stalls or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—create a timeless symphony before exhaustion/day’s demands—is clear and coherently pressured by the ticking dawn and incoming customers. Escalation is modest: the nautilus flares and memory intensifies, but no option is decisively foreclosed. The “work before it hits” frame supplies urgency but yields little visible loss beyond fatigue. Resolution arises from stance crystallization rather than a hard trade.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens at the first arch when Mara must choose between two costly selves. After that, pressure proceeds via accumulative glimpses rather than fresh external constraint, but the cost of renunciation at the end lands. The ebbing power hints at a clock, though it doesn’t force a specific tactic. Overall tension holds, if more contemplative than pressing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—piercing numbness—tightens once when Lila risks the backward play with the hush coil, which immediately deepens sensation. Pressure grows more by density and communal widening than by adversity; no significant reversal or cost threatens failure after the first try. The closing gift drum signifies an earned shift but not a high‑friction trade‑off. Tension is present yet gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. safety/solitude) tightens through the note, the alarm, the clinic reveal, and the perimeter lights flaring. He makes active choices that foreclose safer paths (enters zone, accepts vial, burns the message). The price is conceptually strong but not deeply felt in-body at the peak; the exit is a touch safe. Still, pressure coheres and grows under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (risking emotional unraveling to understand her tears) is signaled early and tightened when she commits to UV revealing and inhales. A path is foreclosed: she abandons avoidance for engagement, paying with immediate vulnerability. The escalation is primarily internal but coherent and sufficient for the length. Cost is felt, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to engage his pattern of “maybes”—is signaled early and tightened when the being forces a choice. The reversal/turn arrives with the options (unravel, keep, cut), and the cost manifests as released memories and foreclosed self-myths. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and rising under the chosen lens. A slight softness remains in external consequence, but the felt price is credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes focus on whether Lira can transmute communal grief into shared potential; pressure tightens as the music swells and the crowd’s hush turns attentive. Escalation is a credible deepening rather than a reversal; agency is central in choosing to risk breaking tradition’s silence. Cost is mostly social/emotional and might read light for some editors. Still, the shift from wall to threshold is a meaningful narrowing and reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—relief at the price of lost joy—is signaled early and tightened when Lira tests the scent and must decide. The warning creates a clear trade‑off, and her acceptance closes the loop. Still, pressure remains gentle; there’s no significant reversal or deepening beyond the test. The cost is present but not viscerally dramatized in‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are intimate: will Clara expend attention and bend rules to uplift the unseen. The main tightening occurs when the locket’s note (“For the one who notices”) reframes her morning indifference, prompting the forged letter. Escalation is gentle and credible but rarely presses her into visible sacrifice beyond ethical risk and time. The resolution follows from her agency without reliance on luck to solve.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible—connection vs. isolation—and the investigative path tightens once via the light‑bending clue leading to a time‑stamped tag. Escalation is mostly procedural and contemplative; little visible price or foreclosed option tests Kael’s commitment. The reveal reweights meaning but doesn’t press a consequential choice beyond recognition and acceptance. Tension remains warm rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—witnessing the birthplace of echoes—tightens cleanly as the pendant heats and the fissure demands a choice. The meaningful turn is her decision to twist the pendant and step in, paying with disorientation and risk. Stakes remain personal yet thematically scaled to the city’s balance. The cost could be sharper, but the escalation is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming ambiguous loss—tightens through the ritual’s intensification and the mosaic’s on-page shift. The key deepening is Elara’s embrace of flow over preservation, with the “eyes aligning” functioning as the turn. Price is primarily emotional; no hard trade-off but a credible relinquishment of a prior stance. Pressure remains coherent and grows to the charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    There is a dominant stake (protecting the vulnerable by decoding the message) and one meaningful tightening (committing to the basement and activating the decoder). However, obstacles are minimal and coincidences assist rather than press (the labeled machine works immediately). The price of visibility is stated but not stressed on the page, so escalation feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—intervention vs. release—tightens at the hellebore beat when she pulls back, foreclosing her standard tactic. Pressure is primarily internal, coherently escalated by Mara’s check and the plant’s live metamorphosis. The price is modest (ceding control, not a material loss), but it’s legible and alters her future approach. No extraneous subplots dilute the throughline.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding a way to make meaning/art post-wars—is established early and tightened by the discovery and exchange. Escalation is modest but clear: chance find → stranger’s proposition → irreversible act of grinding the brooch. Cost is visible; the resolution grows from her choices rather than coincidence. External antagonism is low, but internal pressure stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s stewardship of the cave’s harmony versus embracing unpredictability—is clear and tightens at the pearl transfer. The decisive act (closing her hand) triggers visible loss and redefinition. Agency drives the turn; the cost persists (shattered crystals, pilgrim/pearl gone). Stakes remain intimate but consequential at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on recovering communal memory; escalation occurs through patterned returns and discoveries (journal → fisherman’s testimony → locket fit). Pressure remains gentle; few options are foreclosed and costs are minimal. The final tightening is the trumpet’s completion, but the path lacks a sharp test or sacrifice. The calm, accumulative mode is coherent but low-heat.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early (reach the “fortress”/cross the habit threshold), and pressure tightens through physical progression to the chamber. The decisive moves are protagonist‑driven (using the punch, placing it on the pedestal). The primary cost is internal and conceptual; external jeopardy is minimal, keeping escalation quieter than it could be. Still, the cadence shift at the hologram/ticket beat works.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain purely skeptical or embrace a charged unknown—is clear and intensifies as transcribing escalates memory‑flood pressure. The meaningful tightening arrives when Clara commits to transcription and then to keeping the tile. The price paid (relinquishing certainty) is understated but present; external jeopardy is minimal. Tension is mostly internal and steady rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—escape vs. fear of the unknown—is signaled early and escalates through the storm’s intensification, Lira’s reveal, and the mirror’s counterfactual. The decisive tightening is the demand to “let go together,” foreclosing the path of stasis. Cost is legible: surrendering anchors, risking void, renouncing the loop. External coincidence (storm timing) pressures but does not resolve without their choice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stakes are clear and escalate: guns drawn, a reveal, then leverage-based negotiation. The meaningful tightening is Elara stepping out and forcing the casket to be opened, narrowing options. The price—surrendering the scroll—registers, but the agents’ swift capitulation and the summarized hour reduce felt resistance. Tension is present but resolves too smoothly to fully charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are largely internal (can she “collect” time’s textures), and escalation occurs when the hum synchronizes with her breathing and unleashes the writing torrent. There’s little adversarial pressure or a foreclosed path; consequence remains conceptual rather than felt. The tightening is singular and satisfying in mood but light in cost and trade‑off. Overall tension is steady rather than mounting.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaim identity) is clear and escalates through the storm and the container shift. The storm supplies the meaningful tightening, narrowing options and catalyzing the locket find. The price is largely internal, with limited foreclosed alternatives or visible cost beyond risk endured. The crucial reversal hinges on discovery more than a pressured trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are focused: prove the riddle’s sanity through action. Escalation is clean and textural—the hum intensifies, dials react, then a hard stop forces reappraisal—earning the shift. The price is an internal relinquishment rather than a concrete loss, which reads true but somewhat gentle. A sharper trade‑off under pressure (risk of breaking the cello, letting go of a key proof) would deepen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (resisting privatization) is clear, and pressure coheres around the Council’s arrival and demand for answers. The tightening is credible—public confrontation—but the escalation is relatively smooth, with little sacrifice or reversal to narrow options. The outcome (Council withdrawal) involves stance crystallization rather than a price that bites on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving a human mark before automation—tightens via the live clock and approaching drones. The meaningful deepening is the dawn-triggered dissolution and photograph capture just before interruption. Opposition is light and largely atmospheric; the price is primarily existential. Still, the cadence shift at dawn provides a tangible escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (make HB‑7 mission‑ready before launch) is clear; a single tightening occurs when the problem proves deeper than a patch, requiring recalibration guided by water‑mapped oscillations. Pressure escalates coherently but gently, with no major reversal or visible sacrifice beyond time/attention. Resolution arises from Lira’s agency, not coincidence. The clock (dawn/launch) is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (reach/understand the Singular Convergence) is signaled and tightened through a midnight escalation that demands physical risk and interpretive courage. The decisive deepening—revealing light beneath the ice—reweights options and knowledge and exacts a bodily price. Conflict remains mostly external/internal to Clara; Jorn’s pressure is light but effective as a sanity check. The tension is steady rather than harrowing, yet it credibly narrows her path to a single commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are coherent (revival vs. desolation) and signaled early, but pressure is soft; success unfolds with few obstacles or trade‑offs. The escalation is primarily a density increase rather than a test that forecloses options. The crowd’s arrival and the bell’s harsh tone hint at friction, yet no turn forces a meaningful sacrifice. The final renunciation is gentle, reducing felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (decode/release before storm damage) tightens at the chamber when the hush overwhelms and she must endure rather than flee. The key reversal is her renunciation of capture for release. The price is present but understated, with the storm clock mostly atmospheric rather than tactic‑shaping. Still, escalation coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (claiming authorship vs. being drowned by inherited hush) is legible; pressure tightens with the ghost’s warning, the hooded twin’s demand to “finish,” and the placed lattice. The meaningful turn is Elias’s stance declaration and placement beside the father’s lattice. However, explicit costs or foreclosed alternatives are understated, softening escalation. Tension is steady but rarely bites.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear—freeing the bound soul and ending the night—and escalates via the resonant awakening. The tightening is singular but effective: Elara’s choice to press bead to fruit triggers the split and forces the release. The price lands more as conceptual/emotional repricing than as a palpable loss; risk feels largely controlled. Still, pressure coheres and deepens to a satisfying cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates via density rather than confrontation. The main tightening is the heart‑room merge and the commitment to finish “the final stitch,” with the plates’ depletion as price. Pressure remains low‑friction: no credible opposition tests her resolve beyond endurance. The result is resonant but short on felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are legible (can she re‑ignite communal faith and her own) and tighten with the tomb find and the sundial’s activation. Escalation is primarily atmospheric and spiritual; there’s little pushback beyond eerie roots and patience. The harmonic tone and pulsing walls provide a decisive intensification that forces a stance. The price is present but underplayed, keeping tension strong but not peak.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (decoding the margins to recover a thread to her past) is signaled early and deepened by the letter’s arrival and the fountain revelation. Escalation coheres through Lira’s agency; the clue chain narrows options effectively. Price is primarily emotional/missional rather than a foreclosed alternative, muting intensity. Still, the tightening beat at the fountain reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (preserving/encoding truth before the council seizes tools) is signaled, but on‑page escalation is soft. The main tightening is moving the sacred flame and revealing the chart’s shift; no option is clearly foreclosed and the danger remains largely offstage. Agency exists (Zara directs Jaxon, employs the candle), yet the price of that action is not made legible. Tension hums, but doesn’t bite.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (recover the unspoken to heal) is signaled early and tightened by the apparition of letters and the choice to accept fragments. Pressure escalates through intensifying songs and the moonlight ritual, culminating in an endurance choice (stay till dawn, accept imperfection). The cost is emotional and legible but quiet, with no sharp reversal beyond the pattern break of letters appearing. Effective for the lens, if a touch gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (can meaning be regrown from ruin) tightens as she shifts from decoding the cast to intervening publicly with the coral. The meaningful turn is her choice to bring the object to the table and speak; the general’s touch confirms pressure meets resistance. The price is primarily conceptual/emotional; external stakes remain soft, keeping escalation modest but coherent. One further on‑page consequence would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reviving joy/memory) is clear and escalates via the public display and Marla’s recognition. The crowd’s growth and spontaneous music mark a single meaningful intensification. Costs are primarily emotional and reputational; no hard trade‑off narrows options beyond exposure/vulnerability. Tension is steady but not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (awaken the mural’s secret) is clear, with a meaningful deepening when the awakening folds back to her grandfather. Escalation is more revelatory than adversarial; tension builds through discovery rather than threat. The decisive tightening is the harmonization moment; after that, pressure eases quickly. A clearer on‑page cost or foreclosed option would lift stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (access to the club and amplifying defiance) is clear, with one tightening via the pheromone trial and the seed’s activation. Yet pressure remains low: the test is passed instantly, and the amplification faces no on‑page opposition. The final glow is triumph without a trade‑off shown. Without a felt price or a foreclosed option, escalation stays modest.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—finding a truce between pain and beauty—tightens through the postcard’s disruption and culminates with the planting and the first sleep. Escalation is a deepening rather than a narrowing; still, the seed’s appearance forces a trust act that forecloses the old tactic of sleepless control. The felt price is giving up the shield of insomnia; the payoff is earned. Tension is quiet and could support one sharper mid‑scene pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: maintain the chime’s function to keep extinct feelings dormant. Escalation tightens via the director’s impossibility claim and the risk of improvising a new harmony. The turn is protagonist-driven (choosing the lullaby), with consequences visible in the stirred “joy” and “grief.” The price is more philosophical than material, slightly softening the sense of peril.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding trust—tightens through Henrik’s pointed question and the restricted‑section key, forcing a move from analysis to vulnerability. The visible price is risking contact after prolonged silence, with time pressure implied by the impending wedding. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent and sufficient at this length. The absence of a stronger counter‑force on the page keeps intensity modest.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (decrypt the adhesive’s compassion) is clear, and the amphitheater’s breath quickening implies a mild clock. However, escalation is mostly atmospheric; no option is foreclosed nor a price exacted during the solve. The decode arrives without a hard test or reversal, keeping pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—what to do with the chip/legacy—tightens when the ledger entry and dream refract the dust‑mapping into a “time map,” forcing a stance. The meaningful turn is the shift from delaying/decoding to action: pack and go to Voss, while foreclosing client work. Pressure is more internal than external but grows coherently under the chosen lens. The on‑page cost is modest yet credible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (find truth/father; reframe thresholds) tighten as the terrace aligns, she descends, interprets patterns, and authors a code that forces a step with cost. The visible price is the renunciation embedded in “not meant to be revisited” and the terrace’s disappearance. Pressure is internal but coherent and escalates once decisively. A more explicit risk of failure or competing pull could have intensified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (to witness/affirm belonging via alignment) is present, and pressure rises as the light pattern shifts, converting skepticism to awe. However, escalation is gentle and cost‑light; no option is foreclosed and no tactic is forced under duress. The alignment’s arrival supplies the turn more than Mara’s pressured choice. The result is moving but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is clear and coherent, and pressure accumulates via new evidence (seeds) and the move to the geode’s heart. Escalation is primarily knowledge‑deepening rather than option‑narrowing, with minimal visible price. The pool sequence provides the single tightening and turn needed at this length. Stakes remain largely abstract, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—to prove pattern can guide the crowd—escalates through the deliberate discord that stops the arcade’s breath. The mechanized clown serves as a catalytic pressure, and the pivot to the fountain provides a meaningful tightening. However, the price of that tightening (risk of failure, backlash, or loss) remains largely implied. The resolution is earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—renewal under prohibition—is evident early; pressure tightens when she adheres the dust and moves to the forbidden inscription. The decisive intensification (writing the verse) exacts cost and forecloses a safer path. No antagonist is needed; internal and situational pressures interlock coherently. The ban’s momentary “waver” gives a clear peak before settling into an earned, costly refusal to overturn the order.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is internal clarity; pressure builds gently via the ripple‑watching, not through tightening alternatives or risk. The “before everything shifted” line hints at stakes but remains abstract on the page. The only turn is the ripple‑induced realization and note—satisfying but low‑intensity with minimal price. Escalation is more tonal than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether he remains haunted or finds a livable stance—is clear, and pressure tightens when he opens the cracked box and tips the hourglass. The cadence shift at dawn is the meaningful deepening that narrows his self-story options. Cost is internal and credible, though resistance is modest and the path risk‑free physically. A single tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can she engineer hope by patterning the grotto) is present and intensifies via the trial balloon’s launch and the needle’s “17,” culminating in the vista and reframed gauge. Under the accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase and pattern break rather than reversal. The price remains abstract—no concrete loss or foreclosed path on the page—so the tightening is felt but not bruising. The decision to continue tomorrow is earned yet low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (how to bear legacy/listen to the walls) tightens through diaries and the physical groan, culminating in the decision to burn the heirloom. The price is legible and alters the field of meaning. Pressure is mostly internal and atmospheric, but it coheres under the accumulative lens. A hair more external constraint could have heightened the commitment test.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (convince mirrors) is signaled early; pressure coheres through sequential mirror attempts, increased effort, and the interrupting bells. Escalation is a density rise rather than reversals, with a clear tightening at the bell‑strike that threatens collapse and forces her to spend the last of her energy. The price is felt but not devastating, keeping tension tempered rather than acute. Resulting trade‑off is acceptance of unseen outcomes, which fits the lens but limits visceral bite.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—securing a peace treaty—is clear from the outset. Escalation is modest but coherent: posturing → lull → softened hostility → guided clauses and signatures, with Elara’s agency catalyzing the turn. The price is present (concessions, ambiguity, regret), though concrete trade-offs on-page could be sharper. Tension is steady, if more atmospheric than combative.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (can an act of release answer his need for grace?) is clear and tightens: placement → imagined trill → water poured → storm erasure. The choice forecloses a path—he gives up the relic and refuses verification. Pressure is mostly internal but coherent under the chosen lens; the storm is complication, not solution. Cost is unmistakable in the loss and in moving on to the resort.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear (free the echoes; resist conformity) and escalate through a density build—threads glow, motion intensifies, then release. The tightening is largely cadence‑based; there’s no reversal or hard trade‑off, and price is mostly exertion plus ongoing opposition. Still, agency drives the turn (her dance unbinds the threads) and the outcome reweights her stance. A concrete cost or lost option would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—can he test a more ethical mode and earn a live audience—tightens when a drifter scoffs and he must commit to reversal rather than retreat. Pressure is coherent but gentle; the price is social credibility and the risk of failing publicly. The reversal is the lone decisive deepening and it lands. Costs don’t foreclose a path beyond conceptual stance, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring the overlooked—tightens with the monarch’s arrival and the risk of breaking the moment. The meaningful turn is the butterfly’s landing, which validates the signal; the visible price is labor and chosen impermanence. Pressure remains gentle; escalation is textural rather than narrowing options sharply. Still, the cadence shift at the landing credibly reweights the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through glow→pulse→beam→embodied presence. The tightening is clear as effort intensifies and the sanctum “listens,” with the names burning brighter as a price and payoff. The cost is mostly exertion and emotional exposure; no option foreclosed beyond endurance, keeping the pressure slightly gentle. Still, agency drives the turns and the resolution is earned by his committed labor.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are internal—can she align with the directive’s question—and pressure coheres as the storm approaches, the seal reveals, and the dream intensifies. The meaningful tightening is her active invitation of chaos and the choice to leave as “architect.” Cost remains largely conceptual; few options are foreclosed on the page. The beat structure is clean but could use one tangible loss or trade‑off to sharpen consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant/answering the unknown—is signaled early and tightened by the rumble, the chamber reveal, and the requirement to align the tiles. Each apparent solution generates deeper stakes (key → lock → merger → self-implication). The primary cost is internal and conceptual, not visceral, but it’s legible enough to reweight options. Tension sustains at beat level without needing a hard antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightens through resource depletion and the skeptic (Kael). The last drop and the time constraint from the waning reality shift are credible escalations. Tension remains gentle; conflict is persuasive rather than adversarial. Resolution arises from Lirael’s agency and Kael’s decision, with a contained, believable price.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capturing the runaway dream—is clear, and pressure coheres through the rebuild/ritual to the path opening. The key tightening is the mirrors activating and the sextant selecting a non‑stellar horizon. Still, tangible risk or a hard trade‑off is minimal; success arrives without visible loss beyond letting the stranger go. The end’s inward pivot deepens meaning more than it escalates threat.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (keep orchard alive; mend a generational promise) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens—no obstacle challenges the repair. The single turn is the successful mend → bloom; there’s no narrowing of options or visible price. Agency is present but untested; persistence reads as given, not strained. The result feels serene rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to embrace forbidden, nonlinear inheritance—tightens from curiosity to committed act. The key deepening beats (portrait shell, library vision, map) narrow options toward the tree. Resolution is decisively hers, with institutional defiance implied. Pressure remains mostly internal, so the felt price is restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are focused on gaining access (and implicitly rescuing Kael/knowledge), with a meaningful tightening at the guardian’s demand. The decoding choice forecloses failure paths and narrows options. The price—a surrender of certainty—registers, though the beat could press harder on risk. Escalation remains coherent and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding/earning the garden—appears early and tightens at the hidden‑door turn. Escalation is largely smooth rather than strenuous; each step works, generating little resistance or trade‑off. The resolution stems from Lira’s choices, but the price paid is minimal. Tension sits more in wonder than in jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—accessing and aligning lost knowledge—stays clear. Escalation is present (gears grind, sparks fly, glow intensifies), with her persistence narrowing options to “finish or fail.” The price is mostly momentary danger and strain; no lasting foreclosed path is felt. Resolution is earned by her method, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake (quiet the storm) tightens as the beings’ hum crescendos, pressing her to commit to the spiral/stone conjuration. Escalation is coherent under the hybrid/accumulative lens, with a decisive intensification (light eruption; pure tone) that flips the field. The price—physical strain and the acceptance of coexistence, not eradication—lands, if softly. A slightly sharper trade‑off or foreclosed option would elevate stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rekindling the beacon’s song to break the hush—is signaled early and tightens through repeated failed attempts and physical degradation. The storm night functions as a pressure spike; Elara adapts tactics under stress and pays a price. Slight reliance on an external flicker softens the sense of pure agency, but her preparation and decisive act govern the outcome. The enduring void at the end preserves meaningful consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (what kind of archivist she chooses to be) tightens under the fog’s live clock and the deepening hush. The decisive intensification is the final crack and evaporation, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is present but gentle, more renunciation of habit than sacrifice. A sharper external pressure or lost opportunity would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (redeem craft/defy hopelessness) is clear and pressure coheres from rumor → note → chamber → ignition. Escalation is more atmospheric than oppositional; the key tightening is choosing to risk lighting the lilies. Price is primarily internal; external hazard is hinted (fortress shudder) but not tested. Still, agency drives the turn and reweights options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to bridge the rift with Kael—stays focused and tightens through the embrace of the pause. Escalation is quiet: the cicada’s glow, the repositioning, and Elara’s final overture produce a credible deepening rather than a reversal. The legible price is patience and risk of non‑resolution. Pressure could sharpen once more on the page to reach higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake—brief escape to harvest silence versus safety/time—tightens via the live clock and the doll’s loss under reversal. The inversion hour narrows options and forces a trade-off (reach for doll vs return). The visible price (losing the doll) charges the aftermath. Escalation is clean if modest, driven by the window’s pressure rather than an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is internal—to find a method to comfort through silence—and pressure coheres as the terrace quiets. Escalation is a single decisive deepening (vial stills → silence “speaks”), not a multi‑step narrowing, so it reads modest but sufficient for length. Agency resolves in a practical decision (adjust routes), yet the price is mostly philosophical (relinquishing a controlling frame). Stakes could feel sharper if any competing good or risk pushed back on her new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (find stairway, claim/restore), and pressure tightens via the clock, bones on the steps, and the guardian’s demand. The decisive deepening is Lira choosing inquiry over force, narrowing options to truth/purpose rather than power. The price (renunciation and irreversible collapse of the stair) is legible but moderate; danger feels curated rather than harrowing. Escalation holds under a causal lens with one meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: preserving the fading threshold versus the cost of reconnection. Escalation is modest but real—knock, arrival tension, decision to cross—foreclosing the path of isolation. The sanctuary’s shudder marks a visible price. A sharper on‑page complication post‑crossing could further intensify cost, but the core tightening works.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is explicit (implode/collapse/death), pressure coheres, and escalation tightens toward a single choice. The decisive action is protagonist‑driven and resolves both external and internal tensions. However, the on‑page price for that choice feels light, and threat dissipates quickly after the turn. Tension at sentence level is steady but not jagged.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (unearth the truth) is evident early; pressure coheres and tightens via the escalating sound and thickening atmosphere. The decisive tightening—the hum revealing the lock—narrows options and leads to the letters. Costs remain mostly internal and conceptual; no meaningful loss or risk beyond psychic strain. Escalation is clean but a bit safe.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—break stasis and seize/reshape reality—is signaled early and tightened by agency-driven acts. The key escalation is the string break that forecloses stasis and forces descent, with the orb-shatter deepening pressure. The cost (relinquishing capture, greenhouse crumbling) is felt but could cut deeper on page. Tension scales coherently under the causal lens without coincidence doing the solving.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to extract meaning from erasure—tightens with the date discovery and the dust‑ring inference. The door slam gives a small cadence jolt. The final choice to open a new file is a credible escalation of commitment, though the price is understated. Pressure coheres but never becomes acute.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: expose the Council’s erasures and escape with proof. Pressure tightens via the three-minute sweep, alarms, and drones, culminating in a forced dive and the relay’s destruction. Escalation follows the chosen tactics rather than coincidence; one clear tightening suffices at this length. The cost is visible (station lost; life-risked extraction), though internal moral tradeoffs are minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates coherently: mist thickens → figure speaks in code → Elias intensifies and pays breath-cost. The tightening forecloses a path (letting the code complete) via endurance rather than reversal. Stakes stay a touch abstract (cosmic “end begins”), but the on-page pressure is felt through tactic and bodily price. The resolution feels earned and not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are articulated (decode leaves to avert storm/harvest silverseed), but pressure escalates gently without meaningful resistance. The decisive act (prodding dust and building monuments) succeeds without setback or tradeoff. The storm remains offstage, and options never truly narrow beyond the ritual’s commitment. Tension is atmospheric rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (find the compass/what it signifies) is evident, with one meaningful escalation via the sudden fall and near-drowning. Agency manifests in choosing to dig, grasping the compass, and reinterpreting its use; however, the decisive turn is partly accident-driven. Cost is present but light (physical jolt, relinquishing perfection). A slightly sharper trade-off under pressure would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (know/atone) is signaled early and tightens with the irreversible drop of the coin. The apparition reframes options and extracts a price (irrevocable loss and incomplete answers). Agency is present in the initiating act and the acceptance at the end, though the conflict’s external resistance is gentle. Tension escalates modestly but coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (can laughter be integrated into healing) is present early, with escalation when the figure challenges her fear and she offers the tooth. The pressure deepens via a single tightening—admit truth, risk redefinition—rather than multiple turns. The price is internal (risking that joy alone fails); external stakes remain modest. Resolution stems from her stance, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can he adopt a stance of mercy without breaking—tightens through the hum/spore escalation and the woman’s challenge (“Mercy isn’t a equation”). The reversal is internal but earned: he renounces the “formula” solution for endurance, with sensory cost. Tension operates sentence-to-sentence via body-environment friction. Slightly soft on overt foreclosed options, but the charged refusal reads consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around retrieving the shard through non-brute means; the decisive tightening is the mural’s crack becoming a door and the breath/star alignment. Stakes stay conceptual and personal rather than perilous, so the felt price is modest. Still, agency drives the turn and the surrender at the end crystallizes stance. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing trapped ghosts by uncovering what’s hidden—tightens as clues accumulate to a concrete find and a reframed mission. Escalation is quiet but credible: observation → climb → listen/knock → evidence → commitment. The price is mostly internal (taking on haunting as work), so the tension never bites hard. Still, agency drives the turn, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (rupture the system to awaken vs. risking total unmaking) is established early and tightens through the frost anomaly and the volatile whisper. The decisive act (printing the spiral, allowing the whisper to break) forecloses the path of safety. Cost is visible in the library’s violent upheaval, offset by the transformative outcome. Pressure remains coherent and escalates without coincidence resolving the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early (expose the Luminari’s fraud) and tightens through the storm and Council retaliation. Kael’s agency drives the key turns; the heresy charge and mirror teardown escalate cost. The price is present and ongoing, though the mid‑piece montage softens immediate jeopardy. Still, one meaningful deepening and a visible narrowing of options land.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—realign the box by confronting truth—is signaled early and tightens when Elias makes Lira name the theft/lies. The decisive beat (her confession) narrows options and triggers change, with an emotional price. Escalation is more deepening than adversarial, but reads coherent under a causal lens. A hint of resistance before confession could have intensified pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—seek untainted, perhaps unknowable, petrichor—tightens as the compass locks, psychometry surges, and the lagoon “presence” appears. The meaningful deepening is the shift from pursuit of sample to confrontation with an indifferent threshold. The price is primarily conceptual (accepting limits) rather than consequentially costly; still, it reweights her options and prompts retreat. One more concrete jeopardy or loss would intensify escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (to unify the island’s fractured timelines) is clear and tightens with the portal encounter. Escalation hinges on discovery rather than opposition; pressure is mostly situational and thematic, not antagonistic. The price paid is subtle (accepting a role), with minimal foreclosed options shown. The “Teach me” beat is the main agency pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure deepens via pattern density and light‑driven discoveries; the inscription triggers a tactic shift (painting the negative space). Stakes remain internal—understanding and legacy—so escalation is quiet rather than narrowing options with a hard price. Agency is steady and coherent, but no beat forces a painful trade‑off on the page. The final charged poise promises further cost rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake is legible early (retrieve truth vs. identity/death) and tightens via the lagoon’s time constraint and Elara’s charge. Escalation is protagonist-driven, but the confrontation resolves abruptly; the trapdoor collapse sidesteps a deeper ethical or tactical squeeze. Cost is present (forfeiting the codex; identity strain) and carries into the ending. Coherence holds under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are singular (revive the cove) with one meaningful tightening when the bottle reframes as lens, enabling the town’s gradual reanimation. Pressure is largely internal and procedural rather than oppositional, which slightly softens cost. The revival beats (fish in net, opening door) escalate consequence credibly. The price—Elias’s hollowed self co‑opted as conduit—registers but could be more sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around decoding the sound pattern and interpreting the shriek, with a clear tightening when he detects the hum matching the foghorn’s silence. Stakes remain largely internal and interpretive, and the price of his final stance (listening over intervention) is implied rather than tested. The escalation is clean but modest, with no hard foreclosure beyond his renunciation of “stopping.” Strong, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reopening the path without collapsing stability—is signaled early and tightened when the creature appears and the cap spins. Escalation is primarily atmospheric and ritualistic rather than adversarial. Agency drives the turn, but the on‑page price for success is modest, with risk largely asserted. Tension swells but never bites down into a painful trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear: solstice hush balance vs. prematurely triggered storms. The meaningful tightening arrives when the secondary rope’s tone agitates the clouds, forcing a new tactic (alternating ropes) that narrows options. Prices are present but mild (risk incurred, responsibility assumed, physical fatigue). Tension is steady and coherent, if more serene than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—attend to the “flourishing stillness” over institutional duty—is legible and coheres. Escalation is quiet but real: the star fractures, she chooses the walk, witnesses the extinction, and returns having foregone the report. The price is modest yet felt; no gratuitous complication. A single, meaningful deepening lands at the crater.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are singular and legible early: whether to keep preserving silence or release the trapped words. Escalation occurs through a pattern break (the box glows; ghosts grow bolder) that tightens options toward speech. The price is emotional and identity‑level rather than situational; it lands but remains gentle. A touch more resistance or trade‑off in the beat before speaking could intensify pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rediscovering time’s texture—tightens through a decisive intensification when the urn fragment interacts with the capsule. The price (leaving the talisman of grief) is legible and alters options going forward. Escalation is more deepening than adversarial, appropriate to the lens, though a touch more resistance or risk in the middle beat would amplify pressure. Still, the turn is clearly driven by Elias’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (harmonize discord) is clear, with the kite-snap as a catalyst, but escalation is gentle. The meaningful tightening is more tonal than consequential; risk or loss remains largely conceptual. No reversal tests her commitment beyond endurance; the cost is the accepted transience of the work. Effective for a lyric mode, but pressure never truly narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: harmonize humans and spirits through a remodel before time runs out. Pressure tightens via the rumble and the risked final connection; escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. The price (pain, potential disruption, and ultimately her life) is felt, though a sharper on‑page jeopardy at the climax could heighten strain. Resolution follows from her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (expose vs. understand “homecoming”) is clear, and pressure tightens through the guided ascent and the choice to enact the ritual. The cost arrives as a loss of cognitive armor and a return of longing; the opened door teases consequence without deflation. Opposition is mostly conceptual (Kael’s counter-belief), which works but keeps the escalation quiet. One clean deepening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can life take root here—stays coherent and tightens with the storm and the tern’s “Khalis” deepening. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens. The cost is primarily ongoing effort against a hostile site, not a foreclosed option on the page. Still, the choice to proceed under tightening conditions credibly crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—binding the settlement—remains relatively abstract and faces limited on-page resistance; riddles resolve smoothly without credible setbacks. The tightening is present (from first riddle to the communal answer of “love”) but lacks a visible price or foreclosed option. Agency belongs to Hush, but solutions rarely force trade-offs. The result is touching yet low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (finding direction/purpose) tightens through the extended glimpse and the grandmother’s departure, forcing a stance crystallization at the three-way junction. The agency is clear: he chooses motion guided by charged uncertainty rather than waiting for certainty. The price is intangible but felt—abandoning prior caution—and it charges the last beat. Pressure scales coherently for the length without false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (Aetheria’s risk) and pressure coheres through the board’s reactions. Escalation is paced and legible, but the resolution comes without a trade‑off; the danger subsides immediately after the final swap. The tightening around the king works, yet no option is foreclosed beyond “fail or succeed.” Stakes feel telescoped—world end is invoked while the on‑page struggle remains comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—unbinding the board/self—tightens through persistence → king topple → reverse pattern; pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. The reversal to “unbind” backward is a clear escalation and tests her resolve to continue acting against the gallery’s pressure. Costs remain mostly conceptual and atmospheric; no option is starkly foreclosed beyond internal stance, which tempers intensity. Still, the cadence shift is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (recovering the shape of home) tightens through the decision to engage the stone, then escalates into physical peril and irreversible loss. Agency drives the turns, and the cost is on the page (shards embedded, stone destroyed). The conflict interweaves internal and external cleanly. Slightly guided help via the mother’s voice softens pressure marginally.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (break the curse/forgive himself) is clear, and escalation tightens through the tapestry to the pedestal. The key deepening beat—the black thread triggering embodied memory—raises internal pressure credibly. However, resistance is minimal and there’s no real reversal; cost is mainly internal and stated rather than stressed through consequence. The resolution feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early (disrupt/retune the ritual), and tightening is clean: illicit ink → word on bone → elder confrontation → spire refracts. Agency drives turns; coincidence doesn’t resolve. The cost is mostly reputational/ideational, which reads but feels low‑risk in the moment; a sharper on‑page jeopardy would heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether she can conjure meaning and self‑mend under dissolving conditions—tightens via the charm’s activation, the workshop’s failing, and her choice to inhale the fumes. The reversal/deepening centers on reinterpreting the charm’s function (“promise”), immediately paired with a bodily price. Pressure escalates coherently to the final stillness. No off‑stage fixes or coincidences resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (seeking a restorative reconfiguration) escalates once: entering deeper, choosing the left fork, and confronting the pool’s vision. The caves’ danger is declared but never bites, so the felt price remains largely conceptual. The reveal of the mother’s face reweights the quest effectively, but tightening could be sharper with one concrete cost imposed by the cave. Resolution is earned by his agency, though pressure stays gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through the humming attempt and Thalos’s interruption. The reversal (expecting reprimand; receiving mentorship) deepens rather than resolves by coincidence. The visible price is light; the conflict resolves smoothly once Thalos allies with her. Tension is steady but not harrowing, capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and advances through one meaningful tightening: the cryptic instruction cycle compels the build and culminates in activation. Pressure mounts, but opposition remains soft (no counterforce beyond time and uncertainty), so the felt price is relatively low. The final command (“Now navigate”) crystallizes a stance rather than a trade-off. Still, the cadence shift at activation works.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stakes are coherent (safety vs. dangerous truth). Escalation occurs via the storm clock, Jorn’s fear, and the ledger, culminating in a strategic decision. However, antagonistic force remains offstage and prices are mostly conceptual; no option is concretely foreclosed on-page. The tightening is real but not scalding.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories/guilt—emerges early and tightens with the revelation that the captain scuttled his ship and stole a child from a mind. Escalation is primarily knowledge-deepening rather than obstacle-based; discovery of the trunk and confession raise moral cost more than tactical risk. Elias’s choice to accept burden is clear but faces limited on-page resistance. The pressure coheres but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (stasis vs. a charged choice) is clear; pressure tightens from pursuit to contact to passage. The decisive deepening occurs when she touches the chip and then steps through the doorway. However, external risk is minimal, and no option is forcefully foreclosed beyond an internal stance shift. The visible price paid is primarily internal and soft.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (face the dreams/what they mean) is signaled early and escalates through the physical climb to a metaphysical interrogation. The tightening beat is the figure reframing the grotto as wound and self, narrowing her options to acceptance or evasion. Her agency drives the end (she turns to descend), but the price remains largely inward, with minimal external consequence on the page. A sharper trade-off or sacrificed option would elevate the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (save the nexus) is signaled early; the ledger intensifies pressure by narrowing tactics to a risked, new approach. The key tightening is Elara choosing uncertainty over control despite prior explosions. While the scene lacks a fresh complication post‑pivot, the choice under danger earns the resolution. Costs are more conceptual than materially paid.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant internal stake is clear and tightens through the decision to risk the ledge despite injury. The meaningful deepening occurs in the cave, where the blank scroll forces a stance shift rather than a simple discovery. Cost registers in stamina, fear, and relinquishing self‑pity. Stakes stay intimate but coherent and sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—can Lira responsibly unveil a buried “ordinary miracle”—is clear but the pressure remains gentle. The meaningful tightening arrives with the engraving and photo click, changing knowledge and prompting the note. Prices are implied rather than dramatized; no option is sharply foreclosed. Tension works at a quiet hum rather than a crank.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—risking harm to transform failure into agency—is clear, and escalation concentrates around the crystallization moment and platform shudder. The tightening is primarily internal but legible: he risks shattering vs. completes the rune and accepts the scars’ transformation. The price remains conceptual and foregone rather than paid on the page, tempering intensity. One strong deepening is present; a sharper cost or foreclosed option would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (reconnect with Lila) is signaled early and tightens through the induced‑current attempt, the voice’s accusation, and the directive to “finish the song.” The price is legible (relinquishing the bottle’s contents; the orchard’s loss cued by chainsaws), and the escalation is driven by Clara’s and then Elias’s agency. Stakes remain intimate but palpable; a minor limitation is that the outcome arrives without a strong on‑page risk of failure once the glow appears. Still, the cadence shift at the voice’s arrival is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (unraveling illusion) is signaled early; pressure deepens via the mural encounter and inward vision. Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a density increase toward the singularity realization, but tangible cost is light. The decisive internal shift is earned, though no concrete path is visibly foreclosed. The piece remains cohesive without a reversal; the cadence shift to peace functions as the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early and escalates via pattern intensification (deeper chime, fjord ticking, water parting). Agency is attention and endurance; the counting ritual is a tactic that narrows options to listening. The visible cost remains mostly internal, which keeps pressure elegant but modest. One sharper trade‑off (risk, renunciation) would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around saving the system and Kael’s stance toward control; the tightening beat arrives with the core “dying” reveal and the barrier’s fear. Escalation remains low‑key and resolves without a real price paid—no pests breach, no sacrifice beyond an internal shift. Agency drives the solution, but the path offers little resistance. The turn is meaningful, not grueling.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (finding a way to live with contradiction/grief) is clear and tightens at the fork. The left turn is a real choice that narrows options, though the external consequence is largely symbolic. Emotional cost registers in the return and decision to face her father rather than chase spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure accumulates through misdirected longing—the suicide misdial and the child’s call are credible tightenings. Mara’s agency drives turns by who she pairs and when she spins the disc; the “because/therefore” is soft but present under the accumulative lens. Stakes stay intimate and humane, yet the on‑page cost to Mara never spikes, keeping escalation modest. The ending endorses her stance rather than testing it to a painful trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear—shore up an unraveling covenant through small acts—but escalation is mostly tonal and reflective. The gust moving the locket and her decision to ink and pocket it provide a mild tightening. The resolution is an interior crystallization rather than a trade-off under visible duress. It works for the lens but lacks a sharper cost or foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: “cure for loneliness.” The meaningful tightening arrives when the rock keens and the ghost interrogates motive, but the scene pays a relatively low visible price to achieve reconfiguration. Elias’s agency (offering, speaking) earns the turn, though Lira engineers much of the plan. Tension is steady rather than ratcheting; potential failure feels faint.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (reaching the stillpoint/finding the mother) is clear early and tightens when the cosmic pause ends, removing the auditory advantage. Elias’s choices escalate commitment (entering the cold river, obeying “dig,” pressing on for “hours, days”). The cost is primarily endurance and sensory strain rather than a hard trade-off, but it meaningfully narrows options. The final meeting reads earned under the established pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (undo harm/responsibility) is present early and tightens when Lira redefines the method and the anomaly groans, forcing a stance choice. The turn is internal but consequential: confess and cede control versus continuing to “edit.” Cost is legible though mostly conceptual/social, not immediate physical. Escalation is clean under a causal lens, if somewhat guided by Lira.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation operates via density: from Kael alone to duet to town, then a second round at the fisherman’s request. The dominant stake—disrupt forgetfulness by turning silence into music—tightens as community enters and responds. Cost is subtle, arriving as ephemeral joy and dawn’s fade rather than a foreclosed option. Effective for this lens, if not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are personal—recovering a promise and the archive’s “true” mode—and the pressure accrues through pattern rather than opposition. One meaningful tightening arrives with the chamber of self-portraits and the grandmother reveal. Still, there’s minimal counterforce or cost that narrows options; her path is largely unimpeded. Escalation is felt but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early; pressure tightens when the woman arrives, tactile contact with the lagoon changes options, and the drumming ritual commits him. The escalation is primarily textural, not antagonistic, but it coheres. The price remains soft—accepting entanglement as identity rather than a clear loss. A sharper foreclosed path (e.g., rejecting the clinical “cure”) would increase stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (reach the hub under storm pressure; prove a tactic) is signaled early and tightened by the ominous shift and the key/symbol puzzle. The staircase and surveillance chamber deepen pressure through changed knowledge rather than a hard foreclosure. The price paid is mostly time and risk, not dramatized as a loss that alters later tactics. Tension works but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure remains coherent but gentle; the fisherman’s question glances off rather than tightening options, and no substantial price is extracted. The meaningful turn is a tonal softening of the canal’s tension, not a narrowed path. Agency is endurance and attention, but the cost is largely deferred and abstract. Stakes stay internal and low‑flash.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether connection and learning can take root—is signaled and coherently deepened by the father reveal and the endurance of losing seven games. The tightening arrives as Lila acknowledges the displays and reframes them as “planting,” narrowing them both toward a shared path. Prices are quiet (pride, privacy, sleep) but felt within the scale. No major reversal, yet the pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs clinging to home—tightens when the whale appears and “Detach” demands a price. The key turn (letting the scrimshaw go) narrows options irreversibly, and the island’s dissolution renders the loss concrete. Pressure could intensify further through one more beat of resistance or risk; as is, the path feels a bit unopposed once she commits. Still, the renunciation is active and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—refusing grief erasure—tightens as she escalates the ritual from selection to polish to vow. The price is largely conceptual/social rather than immediate, yet legible via backstory and ongoing exposure to enforcement. Escalation is subtle but cumulative, fitting the lens. A more immediate on‑page threat would have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (to rewrite boundaries) is signaled early and escalates through intensifying phenomena (humming → cracking → falling crystals). The key tightening is her risked step onto water, which reweights options. Yet consequences remain largely abstract; no palpable loss or trade‑off is incurred on the page. Coherent pressure without a concrete price keeps tension strong but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can Elias “see” and make art that matters—escalates through the plant experiment, the mural’s dangerous beauty, and the revelation of Marla’s complicity. He pays prices: breaking his pigment vow, confronting a benefactor, and trading back the powerful object. Pressure is coherent but primarily aesthetic/ethical, not survival-level; still, the tightening is meaningful at this length. The climax is more revelatory than oppositional, but agency drives it.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering the texture of connection) tightens when the cave hum becomes a melody, reweighting what “capture” means. Escalation is more deepening of knowledge than pressure; external risk and material price are minimal, so the narrowing of options is conceptual rather than consequential. The key tightening beat—pressing the lens to the carving—works, but the lack of a felt trade-off keeps tension modest. Resolution arises from Lira’s stance rather than a contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transmuting grief into mending—tightens when the shadows prove “invitations,” reweighting the ritual’s consequence. Escalation is mostly internal and procedural (working through night, emptying pockets), yet the first‑lantern reveal is a credible deepening. Costs are present but not sharply narrowing options. Resolution comes from his altered stance, earned by the work sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is largely conceptual, escalating through density: the knock → teaching → overnight mapping → dawn resolve. The dominant stake (how to orient in a post‑crash city) tightens into a stance (rebuild via measured echoes). A felt price is muted; there’s no hard trade‑off or foreclosed path beyond a repositioned ethos. Still, the “bring others” beat credibly raises scope and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—risk forbidden contact vs safety—tightens as the pagoda activates and Kael presses her to stop. The meaningful turn is the hum/glow sequence that forces her stance; she pays by losing Kael and accepting danger. Stakes stay mostly internal and conceptual, but pressure coherence is strong for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (“preserve the shape of hope”) is signaled and tightened by the fragile shadow that could shatter; escalation moves from inquiry to enactment. The key narrowing arrives with the decision to utter “Bloom,” risking a brittle state. Some tension diffuses via explanatory dialogue, and the solution arrives smoothly, but agency drives the turn. A more visible price or complication at the peak would lift pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming a viable ethic of care) is signaled early and tightens as labor and reflection interleave; the night‑long reconstruction serves as the pressure channel. Escalation is quiet but coherent: her self‑concept is tested against betrayal and the risk of hardening. The felt price is interior and credible, though external pressure is minimal. The cadence shift at dawn provides the needed turn.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates via successive rings that increase emotional cost and scar pain, narrowing her options to confront rather than avoid. The plants’ urging and the mother‑scene reversals deepen stakes without introducing new threads. The resolution is internal but earned; a small sense of ease smooths the sharp edge of cost. One clear tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on whether love can be located/released; pressure coheres through the intensifying reading and discovery of Elise/Thomas. The reversal is modest: nothing at first, then a flood; a second attempt yields names and a past that reframes the present. Consequence is mostly conceptual; little is foreclosed beyond the implied life‑path choice. Tension is steady if gentle, with escalation more emotional than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal (freeing creativity), with escalation via a clear intensification sequence culminating in the jar and the visionary overwhelm. The decisive turns arise from Kael’s actions (tracing the path, choosing the jar), though the visible price is modest. Pressure coheres under the chosen lens, but a sharper foreclosed option would raise the band. The dawn fade retains charge without deflating momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are legible and singular (restore fading sparks/imagination). Escalation tightens once at the “midnight between choices” beat where Kael must act. However, resistance is low; learning to be “occasionally everywhere” comes quickly, and no credible loss or trade-off is shown on-page. The final choice is earned but not severely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (recover the mind’s “wild frontier”) is set early, and pressure coheres through the clearing, insertion of the gear, and the realization / renunciation. Escalation reads as a density increase (trees rotate, forest‑brain insight) leading to a single meaningful trade‑off. The cost is present but gentle; tension resolves without a hard test of failure or contradiction. Still, agency drives the turn, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes—learn how to keep vigil and locate/evoke unused courage—tighten through the pattern of traversal and guiding others, culminating in leaving the punch and committing to return. Escalation is a cadence deepening rather than a hard reversal; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond embracing uncertainty and time. The clearing serves as the single intensification beat. Cost is present but subtle, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on the integrity of the pact of silence and the guests’ fragile recovery, with Lady Veyra applying acute pressure. Escalation is modest but real: a neglected routine becomes a crisis that forces a stance. The price of speaking is primarily reputational/social within the fortress rather than materially narrowing options. The tightening beat (bolt click) is a clear turn but the aftermath softens quickly into communal awe.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are signaled early and culminate in a single decisive act, but escalation is nearly frictionless—guards are mentioned then sidestepped, and the pretender offers little on-page resistance. The timing constraint helps, yet there’s no real trade-off or loss en route. The throw of the pellet resolves everything without a counterpunch. As a result, pressure reads elegant but not arduous.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—discovering why paths vanish—is established early and tightens when plankton map the coordinates in the storm. The meaningful turn is their decision to follow into danger, with the visible cost of leaving the station empty. Opposition is light (Kael’s brief dismissal/hesitation), so escalation relies more on pattern density than conflict exchange. Still, pressure coheres under the chosen lens and culminates credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (“reignite the spark”) is established early and tightens as the hum peaks and the crowd gathers. Lira’s agency drives the turn; Jax’s role sharpens timing pressure. The felt price is modest (credibility/social risk) rather than a hard trade-off, but it shades the escalation. The cadence shift at “Now!” provides the meaningful tightening for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are signaled (regime drones, the embryo’s contested destiny), and pressure coherently tightens through discovery to the planting. However, escalation lacks a hard test; no antagonist or obstacle forces a costly trade‑off beyond speed and physical strain. The urgency “before the drones return” adds momentum but never bites on the page. Resolution feels right but relatively easy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (can Lila hold a steady, peaceful moment under pressure?) is signaled early. The escalation centers on the gust/flashback and her choice to ground, a credible tightening at this scale. The on‑page price—enduring the spike of grief without dissociation—reads clearly. Resolution is earned via her deliberate practice rather than convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes concentrate around artistic purpose and psychic pressure (“when the walls began to close in”). A clear tightening occurs when he tears the Hanged Man and commits to the redesign, culminating in the candlelit web and portrait placement. The cost is internal and symbolic rather than combative, but it’s legible and earned under the accumulative lens. Tension scales through pattern breaks rather than reversals, which suits the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is established early and pressure coheres: success with the ink leads to higher risk at the tower. The meaningful tightening occurs when the hologram reveals a concrete target and again when the door acknowledges her—each narrowing choices toward commitment. The cost is mostly forward‑loaded (possible entrapment, repetition of brother’s fate) rather than paid on the page. Nonetheless, agency drives escalation at each turn.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are legible—expose the truth at the risk of Council reprisal—and pressure coheres as she contravenes her role. Escalation occurs at the activation/awakening, narrowing options and prompting a public stance. The cost is asserted rather than dramatized (no immediate breach or consequence), softening the felt price. Still, agency drives the turn, and the final pact tightens the line of conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on carrying forward a pacifist legacy by transforming tools and remnants. The storm outside provides exterior pressure, but escalation is largely tonal; the main tightening is the choice to bury the scrap and redefine the knife’s purpose. Price is felt but soft, with no reversal forcing a difficult trade. Coherence is strong; intensity remains low.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is tight: recover the goddess’s echo to reassert cosmic order. Escalation tracks to Kael’s agency (calibration, two distinct strikes) producing the apparition and then the irreversible stabilization via her dissolution—an on‑page price. The tightening is singular but meaningful; the path forecloses the option of preserving the goddess. A slightly clearer moment of dilemma would sharpen the trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (expose or preserve legacy) is signaled early and tightens at the 1987 memo, which forecloses denial. The choice to give the story and accept public/familial cost is an escalation with visible consequence (lawyers, mother’s plea, unplugged phone). Internal and external conflicts interlock effectively. Slight summary compression keeps it from peaking higher.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—tether the firmware or be consumed by dissonance—is signaled and tightened by the decision to enter the memory-space and face maternal guilt. The nursery scene functions as the core pressure point, and Lira’s action (reading the letter) earns the resolution. Still, obstacles are minimal and the labyrinth yields quickly, reducing perceived cost and risk. One added complication or partial failure would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early: preserve the hush vs. interject to decode. Pressure coheres and tightens through the tile’s escalating pulse and the directive “Interject,” culminating in the insertion that forecloses inaction. Cost is present but soft—no lasting loss beyond the risk to the hush. Still, the turn meaningfully narrows options and deepens knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (reframe/rename the plaza) is signaled and culminates in the placement of the tessera. Escalation is a deepening rather than a tightening; the retrocognitive visions intensify resolve. There’s little external opposition or trade‑off beyond relinquishing the wish to undo. The final choice is earned but not tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates through density—echoes breed arrivals, the Wheel reverses, the maze yields a convergence. Pressure is largely unopposed; success flows smoothly, softening the sense of cost. The key tightening beat is the Wheel reversing and the maze dissolving, which credibly narrows options. Final price (losing the coin’s imprint and fading) lands but without a prior near-failure or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—self‑authored awareness vs corporate recall—arrives early and tightens when the geode “aligns,” reweighting his choice. Escalation is primarily internal and textural; external pressure (recall, refunds) remains rhetorical rather than active. The felt price is modest, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed beyond refusing the recall. Still, the deepening is clear and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are dominantly internal—can she interpret and accept the role the object offers—and the escalation is a deepening of access rather than confrontation. The meaningful tightening occurs when the leaf becomes a portal and then dissolves, foreclosing more study in favor of lived transformation. The cost is felt but soft; there’s little resistance or competing value. Still, the progression coheres and culminates in a stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (unlocking a wisdom‑relic to shape futures) is present but pressure is soft, with minimal resistance or visible price. Escalation comes via density increase (echo intensifying) rather than narrowing options. The “tightening” is more of a pattern resolution than a trade‑off. Outcome is earned, but the conflict never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is internal courage vs. caution, with external aim (transmission) as frame. Tightening occurs through hesitation and the false alarm at the railing, culminating in commitment to descend toward the weather station. The cost—risking trust and exposure—reads, but its bite is muted in-scene. Escalation is steady rather than sharp, appropriate but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    Pressure remains gentle; waiting and crossing proceed without a tightening trade‑off or foreclosed path. The only cadence shift is the ferry’s arrival and the gutters’ tick, which does not force a new tactic or price. Internal and external tensions align but do not escalate. The ending is contemplative rather than forced by conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—comprehension—tightens as the glass thrums and visions escalate from past to branching futures. The key deepening is Mara’s realization of her prior role and the oasis’s agency in nurturing one timeline. Pressure remains internal and conceptual; few options are foreclosed on the page beyond the quiet choice to leave. The cost is felt but subtle, keeping escalation strong yet not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are intimate: risk vulnerability to kindle another’s. Escalation is subtle—his decision to approach Mara and offer the talisman narrows options and risks rejection. The cost is mostly emotional and symbolic, not contested on the page, keeping tension low-key. Still, the window-opening and “let the light in” moment read as an earned tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—dependence on a collective past versus self-sourced future—is legible and escalates as the hum crescendos and the sundial evolves from mirror to key. The micro-turns (her spoken refusal/acceptance, hand on the dial, spiral revelation) tighten options, but pressure remains primarily internal and gentle. The library’s lullaby stasis removes immediate external threat, muting visceral cost. Resolution grows from her agency but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: risk connection by divulging a secret. Escalation is modest but legible—spiral memory → invitation → prompt → confession → submergence—with a single meaningful tightening at the pen’s point. The cost is emotional rather than strategic; Elara cushions difficulty, muting threat. Still, the dusk sink and public nature keep the choice nontrivial.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are legible (community cohesion/reality integrity, the station’s survival) and escalate via Lila’s deliberate interference. The subsonic gambit is a true tightening choice with risk of retaliation that materializes later. Some consequences tilt tidy (board reversal, softened arguments), softening the cost curve in the midgame. The final threat restores pressure and prevents a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (securing the key) is clear, and pressure coheres as the organ’s pull escalates into a twisting corridor that resists him. Agency drives the turn—his leap and the deliberate use of the compass to “pin” space. The price paid skews toward internal endurance rather than a tangible loss, and the resolution feels a touch easy. Nevertheless, options narrow once the corridor destabilizes, and the final step into the unknown carries forward consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (recover meaning/humanity in a cold case) is clear early and tightens with tactile discoveries (handprint, locket). Agency remains with Clara’s method guiding Voss’s action, though opposition is soft (no antagonist beyond uncertainty). The escalation deepens knowledge rather than narrowing options, which fits the lens but keeps cost modest. The “reopen the case” line provides concrete consequence without feeling contrived.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (truth vs safety) tightens when the director orders evacuation and Clara chooses the roof ritual instead. The jet stream’s acceleration provides a credible clock; reading the final stanza with the heating nail is the clear peak act. The price is felt but not enacted beyond deferring evacuation, so escalation stops short of a decisive trade‑off on the page. Still, internal and external pressures interlock cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is coherent (will he use this to rewrite “never”), and escalation is protagonist‑driven through the performance. The vortex transport is a clear tightening beat; the final stance crystallizes pressure. However, concrete costs and foreclosed alternatives are mostly implied, keeping tension more lyrical than biting. No antagonist or counterforce tests his commitment beyond his own resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (dissuade founders and break the cycle without violence) is clear but pressure is mostly reported and low-tension. The “territorial markers” tactic is intriguing yet plays offstage, so escalation registers as reflective deepening rather than narrowing options with cost. Resolution arrives without a significant on-page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (to decode or fail/lose the brother’s trail) tightens when Veyra reveals the temple’s rewriting and the need to “bear weight.” The meaningful turn is Lirael’s decision to witness before dawn, narrowing options and risking the fate that took her brother. The cost is more emotional than perilous, so pressure remains elegant rather than acute. Still, agency drives the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (face buried truth) stays coherent, with a meaningful tightening when the vision reframes her self‑image. Agency drives escalation (choosing to enter, to release the seed, to inhale the spores). The price—confronting the possibility of darkness—lands, though the conflict resolves with relative smoothness. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (mend the eclipsed covenant); pressure coheres and tightens through the maze confrontation. The key deepening is accepting that heeding equals pain, culminating in the choice to integrate the clipping. The price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the escalation from peak intensity. Still, the because/therefore turns are protagonist-driven and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is tight and legible; pressure escalates through the required barter, the invasive sewing act, and the irreversible ingestion. Opposition is quiet but coherent—she must accept doubt and reprice her identity to proceed. The trade has a felt price, and the final stance is earned by her agency. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—identity after public failure—tightens when Gus orders him to toss the cloth, forcing a small but meaningful refusal. The logo reveal and subsequent call deepen stakes by connecting him to a lost scene and compelling vulnerability. Escalation is internal and gentle rather than high‑pressure, with limited visible price beyond defying Gus’s pragmatism. Still, the narrowing of options (discard detachment, accept a new purpose) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on reestablishing a broken dialogue; pressure coheres but remains gentle. Escalation arrives with the ritual’s risk and the tendril’s unpredictable bloom, a single meaningful tightening. The price is understated (risk to the arbor and Elara’s renunciation of tool‑logic for translation), which softens tension. No antagonist, but agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—risking dissolution for transformation—tightens at the dive; fear vs. desire is tested on the page. The turning of the tide and the boiling water provide a single decisive intensification. Cost is legible (sacrifice of a prior self), though pressure remains serene rather than urgent. The reprise with the child maintains momentum without adding a second escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on connection versus isolation, escalating from hum → shell confessions → the pearl’s placement. The tightening choice forecloses a path (keeping the pearl) and assumes a lasting burden. Tension is more numinous than oppositional; no antagonist, and consequences arrive quickly. A sharper pushback or risk in the moment of placement could have intensified pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure builds via accumulation: each found message reweights the stake from decoding place to surrendering to flow. The decisive deepening is Mara abandoning purely geographical mastery to draw a heart‑map and play softer, accepting a cost to her control. Stakes stay legible and singular (self‑forgiveness), though the external pressure remains gentle. The final stance crystallizes without coincidence or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—find the library before the second letter—stays coherent, and escalation occurs via density/deepening of pattern reading. However, pressure remains gentle: no foreclosed option or visible price beyond time drift. The intensification (glow increasing, pattern leading to the emblem book) is effective but safe. Consequences if she fails are implied rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early; pressure coheres and deepens as visions bifurcate and the violin’s strings snap. The tightening forecloses a live option (usurpation) with a visible cost. Escalation is largely internal but the material world (snaps, vines) punctuates the turns, preventing stasis. One more explicit external consequence would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is firm and escalates when the pool spiderwebs: a concrete tightening that narrows options. The reversal (lens insight increases strain) forces adaptation via unconventional methods (embellishment). Cost is present but modest—no enduring loss beyond exhaustion. Tension is credible and sentence-level pressure sustains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure is gentle: the key tightening is Elara’s reappearance and the offer of the hairpin, forcing Lirael to choose trust. Stakes remain relational and internal with minimal escalation; no hard reversal, but a credible deepening of options. The cost is the risk inherent in recommitting to the bond and meaning of the heirloom. Resolution is earned but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (sanity/guilt versus honest listening) are clear early and tighten when Elias dons the cloak and begins removing chimes. The key turn—unhooking first the oak, then prompting Mira to remove maple—narrows options and clarifies the “song.” Pressure is steady but not fierce; prices are more conceptual than visceral. Still, agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure builds accumulatively: repeated tests, sustained withholding, and Lira’s escalating need culminate when Lira acts and the pattern shifts. The dominant stake—learning to “vanish” through perception—tightens through density and pattern break rather than adversarial clash. Cost is modest but discernible in the earned patience and risk of letting the apprentice fail. The reversal is quiet yet real: student’s act reframes the teacher’s project.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is present (mastering navigation without moving), and the bird formation provides a meaningful deepening. Yet escalation remains gentle; there’s no tangible risk, reversal, or foreclosed option on the page. The cost is primarily conceptual and historical rather than situationally pressing. Closure feels earned but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is reclaiming the sacred; escalation is a clear deepening (activating keystone, descent to an impossible garden, then choosing the mother’s garden). Pressure is coherent under a causal lens, but external friction is minimal and solutions arrive readily. The renunciation of spectacle for simplicity is the key tightening and feels earned. The price reads more reflective than lived, moderating intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on whether Elias will face his grief and decode his vow; pressure deepens as rumor becomes site, then threshold, then revelation. The meaningful tightening comes with Door 13 and the humming book; the cost is internal, not peril-driven. The choice to leave the key tag behind forecloses a path. Slight softness in external consequence keeps it from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are declared as cosmic but dramatized as personal alignment; pressure coheres but stays abstract. Escalation arrives via the activation and distillation, narrowing to the single signal. The turn redefines knowledge more than it forecloses options, and the on‑page cost remains modest. Nonetheless, the protagonist’s agency drives the deepening to a clear stance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (naming/containing fear to regain purpose) is clear, and pressure tightens as the echoes resist and the temperature drops. The key escalation is Elias choosing to speak the coalesced phrase despite warnings, which narrows his path. The price is felt but modest; the monsters dissolve quickly, softening the sense of risk. Still, agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres: time, heat, widening cracks, and Marla’s skepticism push toward a single shot at sync. The meaningful tightening is the on‑page lock when drip matches the viaduct’s hum. Prices are present but not harrowing; risk is mostly voiced rather than dramatized. Still, agency drives the outcome without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—what kind of guardian Mara will be—is clear and tightens when the daughter reframes the past and the failing dam resurfaces the town. The escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than a hard reversal, fitting the chosen lens. The price is internal (abandoning her expunging ritual and solitary identity), present but subtle. A slightly sharper on‑page cost or foreclosed option would lift this further.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (unlocking the crystal by reconciling logic and intuition) tightens via the decision to risk pain, which catalyzes the breakthrough. The starlings’ pattern isn’t mere ambiance; it becomes the method that, combined with the flame, narrows options toward surrender-plus-rigor. The felt price (burns) adds gravity to the win. Escalation is single but meaningful and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is legible and early: revise patterns or the arbor and hidden city fail. The tightening is modest (a second disrupted node and an all‑night push) and remains coherent under a causal lens. Resolution arises from his agency and skill, but the price paid is light; no live option is sharply foreclosed. Tension sustains, never spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is explicit from the outset and escalates coherently from force mimicry to ideological/energetic integration. The meaningful tightening occurs when Kael abandons brute parity and commits to merging through complementary opposites, risking annihilation. The cost reads on the page via the clone’s destabilization and the explosive consequence. Tension operates at both dialogue and action levels without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding the seed’s purpose—tightens with the plant’s accelerated growth and disappearance, prompting a clear, risk‑tinged pursuit. The meaningful deepening is the move from analysis to surrender/attunement (following rather than forcing). Cost is implied (loss of the specimen, ceding control) but not sharply dramatized. Tension is steady rather than lacerating, yet it coheres under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: restore the household’s laughter. Escalation comes via intensifying effort, sound, and partial returns (first faint shimmer, then distinct laughter), culminating in the light/voices burst; the price is physically paid. There’s no sharp reversal or foreclosed option beyond stamina decay, but the deepening is coherent under the chosen lens. Agency—not coincidence—delivers the result.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightened: the cultist’s arrival and demand force a trade‑off between control (keep the key) and risk (toss, step into unknown). The reversal is protagonist‑driven; the pendant’s warmth/symbol shift escalates internal pressure credibly. Cost is implied (abandoning post/safety) more than dramatized, which dampens the afterbite. Still, agency and a narrowing of options are unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore/transform order by risking the self; the tightening arrives at “almost whole” demanding personal essence. Agency drives escalation throughout; each approximation fails forward. The cost is concrete and immediate (scars, frayed mind), reweighting the final image. Pressure remains coherent without coincidence resolving anything.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around unlocking the hush; a single meaningful tightening occurs when the system “resists,” forcing him to dismantle and risk damage. Stakes remain focused, and the climax is protagonist-driven. The felt cost is there but mild; a further visible sacrifice would deepen the charge. Still, the escalation reads because/therefore rather than and‑then.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is explicit and escalates: from eerie drift to a pressured choice to merge timelines with existential risk. The tightening is protagonist-driven (switching from a standard broadcast to an architectural resonance pattern) with a visible price. The emotional calculus—completion over safety—reads. Slight smoothness in passenger outcomes trims edge.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—proving logic can hold hands with magic—is clear and tightens once the weaving risks unraveling her sanity. The eruption and void force adaptation and a decisive step through the door; agency drives the central turns. The cost signal is present but low-intensity, more conceptual than felt. The curator’s guiding line slightly cushions pressure at peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is internal: can Lirael find a stance amid shifting horizons. Escalation is mild—the move to the city’s edge and Tarel’s question deepen pressure but don’t force a difficult trade‑off. The cost is largely conceptual (embracing uncertainty) rather than enacted. The result is resonant but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are legible early: retrieve a final truth and deliver it. Pressure coheres as the pulse intensifies and narrows options toward the twin hearing aid and the apparition. The solution follows from Lila’s attention rather than coincidence, but the price paid remains primarily emotional and not especially narrowing. Escalation is present, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: make the invisible visible to honor a lost brother before the tide seals her in. Escalation coheres (hum intensifies, water rises, door forced, machine engaged) and narrows options; her agency turns the key beat. The price is risk and a forced retreat, though the trade-off is relatively clean and quickly survivable. Still, the tightening is meaningful and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—erase the error or repurpose it—appears early and tightens when OBS-7 demands a binary choice. Elias’s counter‑move (defragmenting via ink) is a credible deepening, and the unresolved system error is a non‑fix that costs him certainty. Escalation remains subtle; no option is foreclosed beyond the decision to live with contradiction. A sharper felt trade‑off would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates coherently: long study → controlled attempt → momentary mastery → canyon’s counterforce → forced trade-off. The decisive narrowing is clear when the echoes threaten to drown her and the diamond burns, making the discard the only survivable choice. Internal stakes (oblivion) and external threat interlock at the climax. Slight melodrama in the shouted line, but the cost remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keep human limits or let the wild “harmony” play her—tightens via the handset choice and bodily shift. The metamorphosis forces a real trade‑off, with the herbalist’s temptation clarifying cost. Her agency drives the beats (listening, pressing the phone to her chest, using the arrowhead to fold back). The price of refusing the garden’s “lightness” lingers credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing the orchard from mechanized order—is signaled early and tightened through the crack discovery and the statues’ cores responding. Escalation is coherent and Lira’s agency drives the turns (shell placement, persistent playing, last-resort blowing). The price is felt but not crushing; the opposition never adapts on-page, limiting pressure. Nevertheless, the decisive intensification at the geyser of light credibly narrows options and forces commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—bridging the border’s silence—appears early and tightens with the decision to use the mail drop for contraband. Escalation is modest; the storm’s release is offstage and consequence is contemplative rather than pressured. The price/counterforce never bites hard (no immediate fallout), but the coherent pressure thread persists through the ending. Agency is clear; the turn is singular and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure deepens once (bells narrow his path; song reweights the stake), but external stakes remain gentle and largely internal. The halo fragment’s potential as a contested tool doesn’t test him. The choice to sing is meaningful yet faces little risk or loss on the page. Escalation exists, not strongly tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reawaken the stories) is clear, with a single tightening at midnight that changes options. Escalation is internal and atmospheric rather than oppositional; the risk/cost remains soft. The mirror corridor and portal room are good pressure peaks but resolve without a hard trade‑off. Effective for a quiet piece, but not maximally testing.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (catch the dream) is clear and escalates when the usual process resists and then quickens. Agency is present—she chooses to work “feverishly,” accelerating vitalization—leading to the materialization and then the choice to release pursuit. The cost is internal but legible: surrendering the need to pin the dream down. Pressure is coherent though mostly interior.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: whether to unlock despite fear and possible rupture. Pressure coherently escalates from cold and hum to the click, mist, voices, and world-tilt; the meaningful tightening is the irreversible opening that forecloses safety and place. Agency drives the turn, and cost lands. The moral calculus (defy her wishes vs. liberate truth) could sharpen further for a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering/realigning memories) is signaled and coherently tightened through the detection method to the locket reveal. The meaningful turn is the mirror realization and the endurance choice to remain as water rises. Cost is present but understated; no sharp loss forces a trade-off beyond physical risk and deepened commitment. The pressure scales once, cleanly, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (aid for a dying village) is announced early, and pressure coheres through the consultation. The meaningful tightening is the instruction that reframes the path (“walk backwards”) and the visitor’s acceptance. However, stakes stay mostly abstract and the price is deferred; escalation is gentle and conversation-bound. The lack of a concrete foreclosed option on-page keeps tension from peaking.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and early; escalation concentrates when Elara risks the heirloom seed to capture and release essence. The meaningful tightening is the decision to sacrifice the seed with no guarantee of return. Opposition is mostly atmospheric (dissonant waterfall) rather than adversarial, so pressure reads gentle rather than coercive. Closure is earned but the path lacks a true pinch that forces adaptation or loss beyond the single cost.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (release/ground the hush versus fear) is signaled and escalates as whispers grow and culminate in the burst of light. The key turn arises from her ongoing action, not coincidence. However, the price paid is mainly an internal acceptance rather than a felt trade-off that narrows future options. Tension is steady more than tightening into a painful bind.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—reopening and correctly “hearing” the site—tightens from observation to intervention. The key turn (choosing to listen and consecrate rather than force) escalates pressure credibly and produces consequence (the hidden staircase). However, the visible price is modest; no option is foreclosed beyond a philosophy of extraction the piece implicitly rejects. Tension operates more through deepening pattern than sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates via knowledge tightening rather than overt peril: isolating the 12‑second loop, mapping the hum, and the cross‑frequency recognition. The main stake (how to “let go”) deepens when “release” becomes “transmission.” While the cost is more implied than dramatized loss, the narrowing of options—accepting persistence over erasure—reads. A single decisive intensification suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around whether Elias will risk articulation; escalation arrives with the storm intensifying and the progression of targets culminating in the self‑addressed mirror. The key tightening is his refusal to stop when rain hisses and the walls may erase him—an Earned Stasis of endurance. Stakes remain intimate and internal; no reversal or explicit external cost raises the price further. The final act (pressing the bluebell) crystallizes commitment without adding new jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether and how to confront/reveal the captain’s truth—tightens as the elevator approaches the tenth floor. The meaningful turn is Mara choosing to use the goggles and then hand over both items, narrowing options. Pressure remains coherent but the price paid is understated, muting escalation. No antagonist is needed, but a sharper on‑page consequence would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (to prove emptiness remembers) are clear, with pressure increasing via the lurch, the tower’s disappearance, and the transition to dawn. The escalation is gentle rather than forcing tactical trade‑offs; the cost is mostly internal. The meaningful tightening is the loss of anchor (tower gone) that nudges Lila into her charged decision. Voss’s skepticism maintains coherent pressure without resolving it for her.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving a legacy under a live clock—is established early and tightens as discovery leads to action, then to demolition impact. The meaningful turn is her pivot from decay‑portrait to sky‑mirror, foreclosing rescue of place in favor of encoded memory. Costs are present but relatively gentle (no deep moral bind beyond urgency). Tension scales at sentence and beat level without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (pursuit of discovery vs safety/authority) is established early and tightens with the birds’ parting and the captain’s objection. Escalation culminates in the leap, but the portal encounter lacks a counterforce or complication, softening price clarity. Agency drives each turn. Pressure is coherent but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (find the gear set), but pressure barely tightens and the path offers no meaningful trade‑off or loss. The key turn (uncapping the vial) succeeds without complication or reversal. Internal tension doesn’t scale as options narrow; discovery feels inevitable. The result is satisfying but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear early (save the arches/nebula), and pressure coheres toward the gathering. The tightening is modest: collective action succeeds without a concrete on‑page setback or price beyond labor. No reversal tests commitment; the risk stays conceptual rather than felt in-scene. Resolution is earned but comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early and escalates via the pane’s activation and visible failure (cracking) as she continues. The decisive act—singing despite the break—narrows options and exacts a price (sacrificed heirloom, potential loss of tool). Pressure is primarily internal/ritual, not adversarial, but coherence and tightening are evident. A single sharper tactical trade-off would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is lucid and escalates: public exposure to the birds raises the cost as he commits to markers, then to opening the heart’s door. The convergence at the fountain tightens options and risks bodily punishment. The visible price (nut cracked, frost blooming, immediate danger of being seen) gives the ending weight. A single additional complication to his “impressions” method might have sharpened the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (repairing the sister bond) is clear, and the text message is a meaningful tightening. However, conflict resolves with minimal on‑page friction; the conversation at the studio harmonizes quickly. The cost is present but soft, with few obstacles testing commitment. The accumulative pattern still deepens stakes via image patterning rather than hard turns.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—making room for beginnings—tightens when the shadowed man demands a story yet-to-be and she parts with her apex jar. The visible price is the loss of the Bottled Moonlight and the risk of mis‑shaping absence. Pressure is elegant but muted; the knife and hood suggest danger that never quite escalates beyond a poised exchange. The late note deepens rather than reverses, maintaining a quiet arc.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake—can he carry/diffuse collective remorse without being overtaken—tightens via the guard’s near-intrusion and the founder’s guilt flooding him. The meaningful turn is Nessar choosing to submerge and accept contagion to dilute it, risking becoming a vessel. The price is felt and reweights the fortress’s emotional weather. Escalation is measured rather than sharp, but coherent for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (repair to bridge a social rift) is clear, but escalation is soft: resistance is described (“resisted her touch”) without a meaningful setback or trade‑off. The midnight strike acts as a cadence shift rather than a pressure‑driven test. Agency resolves the scene, yet the price paid is not unmistakable. The conflict remains largely symbolic and benevolent.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—merge/repair without losing self—is legible early and tightens when the feedback loop threatens identity erosion. Kael’s agency drives escalation and resolution through calibrated adjustment rather than luck. However, the recovery comes quickly, with limited visible price or foreclosed path, so pressure doesn’t fully bite. The final success reweights options but without a durable on‑page loss.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reach the chamber and retrieve what the margins promise before gravity flips—is clear and escalates with the inversion beat. The threshold effect reweights options (ceiling becomes floor; map appears), a meaningful deepening. The price paid is primarily urgency and disorientation; no hard trade‑off or loss. Resolution stems from her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—make the silent world sing—tightening via repeated attempts, bodily cost, and the breaking of the only resonator. The shattering is a meaningful turn that narrows options and precipitates the grove’s response. Conflict is mostly endurance and attention; external pushback is minimal yet adequate under the accumulative lens. The price is carried into a new tactic (teaching the grove without the tool).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates coherently—silence to hum to glow to apparition—but the dominant stake remains largely conceptual, with limited felt risk or trade‑off. The key insertion is a strong agency beat; the “before the next phase” clock is present but not pressing on tactics. The ending’s consequence is hopeful but light on cost. One meaningful deepening occurs; a second tightening or price would lift stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—opening the diary to understand silence—is clear, with one meaningful tightening as she abandons force for resonance under the fireworks’ pressure. The fireworks’ boom complicates but does not solve, keeping agency centered on her attunement. Cost is mostly internal (accepting inherited silences) and could read sharper, but the narrowing of options is credible. Tension rises at sentence and beat scales without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early, and pressure coheres via dormancy, doubt, and social skepticism. The meaningful tightening is her shift from forcing growth to stillness, which narrows her options and invites cost in patience and social risk. Elders’ resistance softens quickly, limiting felt danger. The climax is quiet but earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The stake is coherent (discover the source before/through inversion), and pressure tightens as gravity wavers and the arch pulses. The decisive act (inserting the tip) is protagonist-driven, with a visible world reaction. However, the price remains light—no hard trade-off or enduring loss is dramatized. Tension is present but more wondrous than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (diagnose cause; locate engineer) is established early and tightens with the 45 mph gust and the climb. Escalation stems from her choices, but the price paid remains mostly risk and effort rather than a foreclosed path. The reveal reshapes stakes conceptually yet stops shy of forcing a consequential trade-off on the page. Tension operates sentence-to-scene, with one meaningful intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unfettering the cavern and certifying wonder—tightens through the swelling song and architectural shift. Escalation reads as a pattern-deepening rather than contested opposition; resistance is minimal. The synchronization with the chisel adds a faint external pressure but never forces a hard trade-off. Resolution is earned by Lira’s agency, with limited on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: playing to bridge becomes playing to unmake, which forces a harder attempt that breaks the tool. The starfield of failures is a clear deepening, and the snapped reeds are a concrete price that narrows options. Resolution stems from altered stance (surrender) rather than convenience. Stakes remain personal but felt; the quiet ending carries charged consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (mastery vs. surrender to feeling) is active from the outset and tightens when empathy merges him with Veyra, foreclosing his analytic distance. He escalates by choosing disorientation tactics, then doubling down despite warnings. The cost is personal and material (loss of detachment; workshop disorder). Stakes remain intimate rather than outwardly pressured, but they land.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres: trust a hooded stranger, use an unsettling relic, and act under ambiguous instruction. Escalation is one clean tightening—commit to planting at the charged locus—leading to irreversible change. Stakes skew internal and conceptual rather than survival‑based, so the felt price is modest. Still, the act is protagonist‑driven and forecloses the path of continued doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—proving her theory—tightens as the ritual escalates, culminating in the glass shattering that forces a stance shift. Agency drives the build (she initiates the ritual, channels, steps into the arbor) and the reversal forecloses the validation path with a personal price. The cost is interior but legible and carried into the closing resolve. A stronger on-page trade-off or external counterforce could have amplified pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (breaking/bridging silence) is signaled early, and escalation tightens through the puzzle’s hums, vanishing pieces, and the crow theft toward the renunciation. The decisive cost—releasing the grandmother’s bead—forecloses a path and redefines tactics (weaving silence). Agency drives the turn rather than luck resolving it. Stakes remain coherent, if largely interior and mythic.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early (save Veyra), and escalation coheres: entry → keeper’s warning → shard trial with bodily cost. The key tightening is Jorin choosing to endure pain to fuse the core; agency drives the turn. Costs land but feel light for planetary stakes, and the path is relatively linear without a deeper complication. Still, pressure grows appropriately for length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear early (opening forbidden door vs. heeding warning), with one meaningful tightening when the compulsion collapses options into a single portal and a further deepening via the mother-figure’s admonition. The decisive escalation is Kael’s renunciation, paying a price in lost answers. Pressure remains coherent; coincidence doesn’t resolve. The ethical calculus is present but not razor-edged, keeping this just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (preserving a sense of safety/continuity after failure) and deepen via the iterative notes. The meaningful tightening is quiet: Elias relinquishes the “real” beam for a communal ritual, narrowing his options to endurance and attention. Cost is present but subtle; escalation is cumulative rather than sharply turning. One more concrete consequence could have heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: to see and steer the dawn. Escalation arrives as the ritual intensifies and the shadows animate, with a shadowy counterforce edging the frame. The tightening is credible but the price remains mostly atmospheric rather than materially constraining. Agency drives the peak beats (tilt, release, raise) and resolves to a stance.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are internal yet coherent: will Lin find a way to read and serve the stories she senses. The escalation is quiet but present—cautious handling → releasing the wing → following purposeful light → blinding flare and loss—culminating in a binding vow. The price is conceptual and symbolic rather than visceral; a slight lack of external friction keeps tension gentle. Still, the flare and forfeiture credibly narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the labyrinth’s healing geometry to reach arboreal memory—remains coherent. Escalation is modest: the recurring pin, storm, and the wall’s transparency produce one clear tightening that changes options. The choice to proceed (and to stop mapping “for tonight”) lands, but tangible cost or a foreclosed path is light. Tension operates more in tone than in concrete jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is legible (revive a dying realm), and escalation follows a clear intensification—discovering the child’s melody tightens options and compels the humming ritual. Still, the conflict remains largely uncontested; no reversal tests her commitment beyond endurance. The price (exhaustion, loneliness, ongoing duty) is felt but soft. The cadence shift reads, but pressure never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reconciling grief without disappearing) is clear, and pressure coheres toward midnight. Escalation is measured—book to map to mirrors to letters—with one meaningful deepening (the key/Third Shelf). The cost is mostly internal and could read sharper with a risk or refusal moment; still, the final endurance choice forecloses a path (flight). External resistance is minimal, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the impossible bread poses a test, Elias chooses planting over proof, and the bread’s conversion to a seed reframes his pursuit. The escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than a sharp reversal, fitting the chosen lens. Stakes remain internal and conceptual, with limited on-page price beyond the relinquishment of the relic and ongoing labor. The woman’s line clarifies rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve the library’s magic) is clear and pressure tightens when the vow dissolves and she’s forced to resample faster. The key turn is her method shift (brisk precision) that briefly reignites the vow, testing her meticulous habit. Cost and narrowing are felt but moderate, with dawn as a slight relieving factor. Tension is steady rather than wrenching, but it escalates appropriately for length.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: intel scarcity → stall proof demand → time window → ambush at the bell → forced choice to destroy. The price is legible (sacrificing the device and damaging the heirloom; igniting market chaos). Escalation stems from Lira’s agency rather than coincidence. A sharper mid-beat loss (e.g., losing the key or social capital) could heighten cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (understanding the compass/world) tightens as the “release” event peaks and the ring’s function shifts from people to “moments.” Pressure grows coherently, though Kael’s agency is more observational than decisional in the climax. The felt price is light but legible; the option foreclosed is his prior explanatory frame. The final cadence has tension but stops short of a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (unlock creativity) and escalates through ritualized action: paint → shadow door → click. The tightening is real but gentle; there’s little risk of failure or loss beyond internal discomfort, so price clarity stays modest. Agency drives the turn, not coincidence, and the new option (begin to truly sketch) is earned. A sharper trade-off or threatened loss would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (recovering the mother’s words) is clear and the main tightening is the keeper’s reveal, which redefines the prize and forces a stance. The quill’s wilt intensifies pressure credibly. Costs are primarily conceptual/emotional; physical risk remains light, so escalation feels measured rather than bracing. Still, the final choice (seed vs. “empty”) is earned and forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres through the melt clock: dwindling ice narrows options and culminates in the last droplet. The tightening is gentle but unmistakable; the price—sacrificing the fragment to achieve the symphony—lands. Agency drives the turn (Elara builds, calibrates, and chooses the final strike), with visitors adding soft external pressure. Quiet escalation fits the chosen lens while maintaining a felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—prevent internal/external chaos from overwhelming—tightens as the storm intensifies and the box leaks. The meaningful turn is the decision to apply a controlled-burn method to the fear-box, narrowing options. Cost is legible: she internalizes the chaos and accepts residual static. While tension is measured rather than acute, it remains coherent and accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around solving the mailbox; escalation occurs through gathering stories to the lock‑combination leap. Stakes are largely conceptual/emotional and remain low‑risk; no path is truly foreclosed beyond the mystery itself. The turn to the code is a meaningful tightening, if gently rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early (retrieve and escape) and pressure tightens with alarms and drones. Escalation is protagonist‑driven (he chooses dance as countermeasure), but the price paid is modest—no hard trade‑off or lasting loss. The beat where drones “falter” feels easy; still, momentum and coherence hold. A single, credible sacrifice would have raised the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake and tightens once: gravity flares as he follows the pattern, then the discovery of the hidden panel. The escalation is largely frictionless—he stumbles but meets little resistance on the way to the pedestal. The decisive deepening (memories preserved, not erased) meaningfully changes options and stance. A more visible price or foreclosed path would raise stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (hush the prophecy), but escalation is minimal and resistance near‑absent. The meaningful tightening is the moment the ripples still and the wing draws light, yet no option is foreclosed beyond the expendable wing. The success comes without reversal or visible price. Tension remains atmospheric rather than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—risking awakening a sleeping building by weaponizing a lie—tightens once with the decision to act now under the Leonids. Escalation is coherent, but the price is mostly conceptual; we don’t see a concrete loss or irreversible cost on the page beyond tremors and dust. Still, the narrowing of options and agency at the dome read earned.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres: the whisper intensifies, the childhood memory strikes, and Lirael commits to a ritual that risks unsealing pain. The option she forecloses is continued archival avoidance; price is the loss of the garden’s velvet and the shell’s comfort. Opposition is largely internal and the path is smooth, but the single tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (forging and planting a treaty that could reorient heirs) is clear early. Pressure accrues via ritual steps and the blood curse, but there’s limited external push or narrowing of options. The single meaningful tightening is the blood seal and completion/placement of the scroll. Costs are implied and moral rather than concretely paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (learn why echoes linger) is signaled early and escalates via density increases—voices through stone, then the mentor‑figure, then visionary images. The tightening is real but gentle; there’s little tangible risk or foreclosed option beyond committing to the burden. Agency is present in the hand‑off of the shell and the final singing, but the opposition is soft. Cost is implied endurance rather than a hard trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—bridging living and dead through truth—emerges early and tightens via the triptych of dreams. Each dream reweights the problem (love vs blame vs endurance) and culminates in a method choice. The escalation is primarily knowledge/depth rather than risk; the price is gentle. Effective deepening, modest pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres around perceiving and answering a pattern—he hears, follows, decodes, replies—creating one meaningful deepening. Stakes are intellectual/spiritual, and escalation is gentle; no option is foreclosed beyond a long vigil. The cost is implied attention and endurance, not a sharper trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (contain the stillpoint before boundary collapse) is signaled early and tightens through discovery to an action that forecloses a path. The decoy revelation deepens pressure and reframes options; Mara’s choice resolves with consequence. The felt price to Mara remains modest, keeping tension just short of the highest band. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding/engaging the storm to cross a threshold—is clear and tightens when the transmission instructs him to use the portico as prism, prompting decisive action. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens (density → mechanism → hourglass upheaval). The visible price paid remains abstract; options don’t narrow with a concrete loss, keeping tension below peak. The resolution comes from agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres gently: can he coax sound and make it matter publicly? The escalation from private experiment to communal effect works, but stakes stay low and the price of success is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates coherently with the ghost’s assault and the deadline of fading light. The meaningful tightening is the pitch duel—he must risk matching, not repelling—which narrows options and exacts physical cost. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve it. The only slight softness is how quickly the ghost relents once the harmonization begins.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    One dominant stake—unlocking the viaduct without force—tightens through a failed attempt and a recalibration governed by the moon’s path. Escalation is quiet but clear: the failed run narrows options to patient micro‑adjustments. The cost (time, bodily fatigue, renunciation of haste) is legible but not severe, keeping tension subdued yet coherent. Resolution stems from Kael’s altered tactic rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (break Cole’s control) tightens when the lantern’s vision of Cole and the “Eliminate” files reweight risk and knowledge. Escalation is internal-external interwoven, though the immediate on-page price is light. The final commitment forecloses compliance credibly. One deeper cost or a tangible risk beat would lift stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are coherent (approve a program that may be cosmetic vs. substantive), and tension deepens with the inmate’s “apology in metal” as living proof. The primary tightening is seeing the heart and realizing the program’s deeper value; thunder and the storm underscore but don’t raise stakes materially. The price is the decision to act, with limited on‑page consequence. Escalation is tasteful but restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres and escalates: corrosive environment, workshop shudder, aligning devices under stress, then a high‑commitment throw that forecloses further study of the artifact. The tightening is protagonist‑driven, and the sacrifice reads as a visible price. Stakes remain singular and legible (ring the unheard bell) through the dive and collision image. A hair more on the risk of failure mid‑dive could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are established early (truth vs. erasure) and tightened by a clear turn when the video reveals the gateway and corporate deletion. The blaring alarms and drones escalate pressure coherently, forcing a decisive stance. The price is legible but mostly conceptual; we don’t see a concrete immediate loss beyond danger. Still, the narrowing of options and commitment to risk read cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (quiet the fear‑storm) is signaled early and escalates through a clear deepening (mirror sequence to “weighted breath before reply”). Resolution stems from her agency, but there’s little visible price or foreclosed option beyond carrying others’ pain. The conflict resolves smoothly once the ritual is complete, limiting felt jeopardy. Tension lives in cadence more than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant pressure crystallizes with the keening and the decision not to wait for ropes; that choice narrows options and risks harm. Internal and external stakes braid (death-seeking vs. life-saving). The cost reads more as inner reorientation than a concrete sacrifice, which tempers peak intensity. Still, escalation is coherent under a situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Lila’s capacity to feel/paint—tightens via conversation to a walk to a reframed stance. The escalation is subtle rather than pressurized; there’s no sharp foreclosure, only a meaningful deepening. Elias’s choices drive the turns, but the on-page price is understated. The rain cements cadence rather than raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake is clear, but pressure stays gentle; consecration proceeds with minimal resistance. The mask’s fall and the prophet’s brief recoil offer a flicker of cost, not a tightening that forecloses real options. No reversal tests the commitment; escalation is mainly a ritual crescendo. The “for now” cadence hints at deferred stakes rather than on‑page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—how to carry grief into making—tightens through a pattern build (lingering longer, the dove, dusk, “enough,” then active shooting). Escalation is internal and cadence‑based, not conflictual; coincidence (the dove) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The price (renouncing the masterpiece‑as‑endpoint) is present but restrained. One firmer pressure point that forecloses an option would strengthen the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (to decode and then testify) is signaled early and deepens as the crystal reframes perception. Escalation is subtle but present: the chandelier incident sharpens attention; writing becomes a commitment; “He would testify” locks a new stance. The cost remains largely social/psychic and prospective, which keeps pressure moderate. Still, the cadence tightens meaningfully under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and legible: will he locate and hold the sound. Pressure tightens when the hum emerges and he must commit, guided only by improvised markers and failing foresight. The price is endurance and acceptance rather than a sharp trade, which fits the lens but keeps escalation gentle. The final stance forecloses the old path (chasing foresight) with credible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—tame/redirect the clock’s force before collapse—tightens through one meaningful deepening: the reframe from “time” to “escape” which alters tactics. Agency is clear at each turn (listen, hum, wire, align systems, sing, leap). Cost is legible but primarily conceptual; we don’t see a foreclosed alternative beyond staying to die, which keeps the pressure slightly abstract. Still, the escalation tracks coherently and culminates in a self‑driven, risky act.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—facilitating a goodbye—is clear early and tightens when the hymn begins and Elias finds his voice. The escalation is a textured crescendo rather than a sharp reversal, appropriate to the lens and length. The cost reads: release/surrender of life and the emotional expenditure by Mira and Clara. Imperfection (vinyl skip) meaningfully tests and affirms Mira’s resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Conflict centers on timing and decipherment: the alignment window tightens pressure, and her agency drives the turn. Stakes are primarily intellectual and wonder‑driven; the text doesn’t stage an alternative path or a price she must pay beyond endurance. The escalation is coherent but soft: once the pattern is spotted, success feels assured. A clearer risk (failure consequences or trade‑off) would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: reconcile the garden’s uncertainty and the wound of Elias’s absence. Elias’s arrival is the key tightening that redefines the tactic (two teeth, not one). Resolution stems from Mara’s agency, but the price paid reads mostly as insight rather than a concrete loss. The conflict resolves smoothly; an added friction point would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the drive to “share light without fire” narrows to a single choice—keep/use vs release/return. The weighing scene functions as a meaningful deepening that clarifies stakes (balance of light/dark) and points to renunciation. Cost is felt in forfeiture; escalation remains modest but apt for the lens. No external antagonist, yet internal/external aims interweave cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to integrate grief—tightens through the pendant reveal and the decision to let Elias in. The key turn is Lila’s exposure and modification of the pendant, followed by the explicit invitation to “Stay.” Costs are internal and legible, if softly rendered; external counterpressure is minimal, which keeps tension on the quiet side. Still, the deepening is motivated and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve neat endings or risk an open one—is established early and tightened through the guide’s challenge and the lantern’s extinguishing. The decisive step (riding the current → deleting the chapter) bears a felt price: embracing ambiguity. Pressure is largely internal but coheres, with one meaningful deepening that narrows options. Minimal external antagonism is offset by clear internal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—reviving the arbor—tightens once meaningfully as the tendril “demands release” and Lira endures physical cost. Escalation is gentle but coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in the tendril’s spent dust and the shift from solo fix to communal tending. The pressure lacks a sharp reversal or forced trade‑off but carries a felt price and narrowing of options (continuing care).

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through the humming plate and the risk of starlight’s fickleness. The decisive move—silver sealing—raises pressure and leads to a living map. Costs remain mostly implied (risk of loss, cold, prior failures), so the escalation lands as taut but gentle. No antagonist needed; agency drives the turn cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the harvest—remains legible and tightens when the last gear clicks and nothing happens before the hum builds. The escalation is primarily accumulative and textural, with one decisive intensification. The price paid is endurance and potential conceptual loss (bottling wonder), but it’s only lightly felt. No antagonist or reversal is needed, yet pressure never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are modest but coherent: convert burdens without shattering them, with the mother’s locket as the moral pressure point. Escalation arrives via failure (extinguished flame), resistance (obsidian), and a narrowing at the locket where he chooses refusal with cost. The pressure deepens once rather than multiple turns, fitting the length and lens. No convenient rescues; agency drives outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are singular: can she shape grief into something holdable. Pressure deepens as the knife is sharpened, the first cut is made, and the candle burns low, culminating in placing the lion. Escalation is a cadence shift rather than reversal, apt for the chosen lens. The cost is quiet—acceptance over erasure—but present.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—release from regret/time-stasis—is signaled early and tightens through the ghost’s challenge to “let go.” The key turn is Veyra’s active renunciation (dropping the camera wheel) with a visible price; the subsequent rest and departure underscore consequence. Internal and external pressures interweave cleanly under the hybrid lens. The escalation is quiet but unmistakable, avoiding coincidence-based resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure coheres but remains gentle: discovery, a living hum, then successful redirection. There’s one meaningful tightening when the terminal shudders and responds. Stakes stay largely conceptual; no live option is foreclosed with cost or risk beyond fatigue/time. The success reads slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—self versus chosen silence—tightens via the unexpected bear and the forecourt’s resonance, prompting a stance crystallization. The key tightening is the bear’s non‑attack and the song, forcing attention and altering fear into curiosity. The price paid is subtle (deferred wandering; acceptance of a liminal path), which keeps tension quiet rather than acute. No luck‑based resolution; the reconfiguration is internally driven.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—seeing through lies—is established and deepens when the sundial targets the warehouse. Escalation is primarily informational; resistance is minimal (a warning, boarded windows) and costs remain abstract. The blueprint discovery sharpens meaning but doesn’t foreclose a live option on the page. Tension stays steady, not tightening to a consequential trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (unlocking/retaining ancient wisdom) is clear early, and decoding sequences deepen pressure. The woman’s intervention tightens options by challenging the premise of a physical loom, pushing a stance choice. Still, there’s limited risk or loss beyond the conceptual, so escalation feels refined rather than gripping. Resolution is earned but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on retrieving meaning from absence, but pressure remains low; the apparition appears without Elara risking or losing much. The meaningful tightening is the presence/vanish beat, which reweights her goal rather than foreclosing options. No antagonistic force tests her resolve, and cost is mostly tonal. Escalation is gentle but coherent for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is clear, but pressure escalates modestly: after setup and assembly, the egg hatches quickly once the lens is adjusted, with little narrowing of options or visible price. The keening and glow are potent signals yet function more as destiny than earned tightening. The late validation by Thalos does not complicate or test Corvin. The final shift feels more bestowed than wrestled from resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around persuading Mara to let go while Lira holds her own history. The key tightening occurs at “What if she forgets me?” followed by Lira’s counter and the release. Costs are primarily emotional and thematic; no major reversal beyond that moment. Effective but gentle escalation limits peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres under a causal/accumulative hybrid: the hum grows, items rekindle color, and the missing piece forces a meaningful turn. Lira’s decision to trust a fragile vision against her skepticism tightens options and leads to a bodily price (bloodied fingers). The dominant stake remains legible and culminates in an active solution. Escalation could feel riskier; success seems probable once the pattern is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—how to wield light without harm—tightening via the sonar’s urgency → ghost confrontation → reframed understanding → decisive act. The escalation feels organic under the accumulative lens, though prices remain conceptual more than visceral. The decision to leave the gear and declare a new practice is earned by prior beats. A starker on‑page cost would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will he break silence and claim the family grief-language—tightens toward the final night of migration. The escalation is a patterned deepening (presence, voice, mounting butterflies) culminating in the poem read aloud. The visible price is largely interior (exposure, acceptance), which registers but could be more viscerally tested. Still, the cadence shift at the end is decisive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clean: prevent chaos by restarting the pendulum during the Hush. Pressure coheres and deepens (the pause lengthens; “air thickening”) and her action is timely and precise. However, escalation peaks without a hard trade‑off or loss—once the method is found, resistance is minimal. The price is mostly exertion and risk of failure rather than a foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on whether she will extract or honor the found history, but external pressure is minimal. Escalation occurs through pattern alignment (stars, knight, name, date, phrase), not through opposition. The choice to rebury forecloses a path, yet the price feels gentle and untested by counterforce. One more tangible constraint or loss would raise the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stakes (prove a thaw/change village behavior) are signaled early and culminate in the equinox test. Pressure coheres but escalates modestly; the main tightening is the public gathering and the ice’s groan, not a hard foreclosing choice. Costs—skepticism, physical toll, burning journals—are present but not sharply priced against a live alternative. Resolution is earned, if somewhat low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (gather and reanimate lost stories) is signaled early and tightened by the broadcast’s fluctuation and the urgent capture of the key line “The wind carries secrets, but the earth keeps them.” Escalation is a density increase rather than a hard reversal; the dirge/strengthening/fade sequence works, but the price remains mostly conceptual. Agency is present (chasing the signal, writing), culminating in a stance to continue despite scarcity. A single concrete loss or tradeoff on the page would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether Lira risks self to “fix” the fleeting emotion in a space that erases art; escalation arrives via removing the mask, dedicating the piece, and then re‑armoring with a deliberate non‑completion. The option to finish/preserve is foreclosed, with the gallery’s ephemerality tightening the margin. The cost is felt rather than tallied, fitting the lens. A slightly sharper external compulsion could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve the old ways vs. sell and leave) is pressed by Mara’s pragmatic pressure. Escalation arrives via the assembly of cog + needle and the auditory turn; the price is physical endurance and social isolation. The resolution is an earned refusal with visible cost rather than a decisive external turn—fit for the lens, if modest. One strong tightening suffices but doesn’t foreclose a new path beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (coaxing unity from threatened traditions) is signaled early and tightens with Elias’s arrival and first faltering note. Escalation is inward: the sob-to-steadier playing and the communal widening to a choir. The price feels mostly conceptual; no on-page loss or hard trade-off narrows options, keeping tension gentle. The resolution remains earned, but pressure is soft for elite-tier drama.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (repattern the plant toward beauty) is signaled early and escalates as pruning intensifies during the alignment. The main tightening comes when she rejects traumatic memory paths and commits to gentler growth. The plant’s “resistance” is declared more than dramatized, so the price feels modest. Nonetheless, agency drives the turn and the alignment peak ties to the bud’s emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent (restore power/wonder), and pressure builds from discovery to a public-facing choice. The decisive act—telling the truth—earns a systemic shift, but escalation is relatively smooth and low-friction. Risk (social reputation) is referenced but not sharply dramatized. A sharper test or loss would have heightened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (prove theory/sanctify hush) is signaled and there is one clear tightening when the air “thickens” and the shard glows. Yet pressure is gentle; no real opposing force or credible risk challenges her path. The success arrives cleanly with little cost or narrowed options. Tension is atmospheric more than escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is coherent and escalates: find and access the ampoule, learn the truth, decide whether to ingest. The “structural weakness” beat is a meaningful tightening; the drink is an earned peak choice. The price is implied (bodily risk, reframed lineage) rather than viscerally felt. Still, the conflict deepens rather than resets, and resolution stems from Mara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early and escalates through targeted actions: test by throwing the smooth die, then a calculated rupture attempt. The key tightening is the creation of the orbit, which forces the trade‑off between grasping and letting go. Cost is quiet but unmistakable (accepting loss to hold meaning). Pressure remains coherent, though an added on‑page risk or consequence during the rupture could intensify stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can kindness endure and be proven—is established early and deepens when Mr. Voss recognizes his mother, converting an abstract want into a concrete path (learn the dialect). The meaningful tightening occurs at the eye-painting → recognition → apprenticeship ask. The on-page cost is quieter (patience, surrender of tool/method, renouncing the need for immediate proof) but credible at this length. No contrived antagonist; pressure coheres through internal-external braid.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (reviving art) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as a deepening from curation to action via the children’s “Teach us.” Escalation is gentle; there’s no robust reversal or foreclosed option beyond time’s drift and dwindling practitioners. The cost is implied (work, responsibility, lingering absence of bees) rather than dramatized as a hard trade-off. The final commitment nonetheless reads as an earned tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: unlock the stone/defy fate. The meaningful tightening arrives with the first failure and the risky re‑engineering with mercury that transforms options; the lighthouse’s reversal escalates consequences beyond his workshop scale. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve it. The price of success remains suggestive (hunger/devouring) rather than paid, moderating the stakes’ bite.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is tight: survive/confront the shadow to expose fear’s weakness. Escalation coheres under the causal lens: invitation-as-paradox narrows options, the moths/thread beat forces a painful grab that costs flesh. The choice to “welcome” the threat is a credible tightening and reversal. Resolution is earned by Mara’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres and tightens via density: flat sound to resonant bloom, to gong, to cloud “fracture,” to silence. Stakes remain mostly aesthetic/ritual, but the groaning circle, falling apples, and precise alignment with transient clouds add cost and consequence. A meaningful deepening occurs at the lightning‑scarred trunk; integrating the seabird’s screech tightens agency. The price is fatigue and the mallet’s dimmed patterns, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the truth in a sealed city—tightens coherently: investigation triggers awakening, turning knowledge‑seeking into communal peril. Agency drives turns (she opens the crack; she plays the codes), and each apparent answer births a worse problem. The price is unmistakable in the city’s upheaval and foreclosed safety. The watchers’ passivity at the end keeps the conflict charged rather than neatly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (recover the buried truth), and pressure coheres as clues tighten toward the chamber. Escalation is primarily informational rather than a test with cost; success comes with few genuine obstacles. The delay-of-war reveal adds weight but not a felt trade‑off in the present scene. Still, the narrowing path from symbol to archive offers one solid deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres and deepens at the groan/hatch beat, narrowing options as curiosity overrules caution. Stakes remain intimate (personal discovery, legacy), and the price is primarily emotional rather than consequential, keeping escalation strong but not searing. The decisive physical act (wresting the hatch) anchors the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (uncover the city’s honest origins) is clear; pressure coheres through the metal groan, locked door, and deciphering task. The tightening turn is the door’s code and the decision to press the stamp. Costs are modest—risk and emotional weight—so escalation reads more inward than perilous. Still, agency drives the solve and the concluding commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (transform grief into durable light; face the shadow) is signaled and tightened. The key deepening is the dream recording’s painful swell leading to a live test when the shadow reenters and she chooses to meet it. Cost is visible (pain, trembling, relinquishing avoidance), and resolution is earned by her agency. Pressure coheres without overreliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—accessing dangerous “unused potential”—is signaled early and escalates coherently through overheating systems and Orion’s warnings. Elara’s refusal to abort forces a high-cost turn (node expansion, observatory loss), and her agency drives every beat. The price is felt on the page and reshapes future options (she’s now itinerant with a new crystal, AI diminished). The conflict is more singular than layered, but the central tightening is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is clear, and escalation occurs via the revelation that alignment, not the chip alone, is key, culminating in the lever pull. Pressure is gentle; obstacles are minimal and mostly cognitive rather than adversarial. The tightening is sufficient but lacks a visible price beyond relinquishing an assumption. Tension relies on wonder more than risk.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. manufactured comfort) is signaled early and tightens with the heart‑split driftwood beat. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent; discovery forces a renunciation that forecloses his usual tactic. The price—betrayal risk and self‑reproach—is legible in the closing ascent. Lack of an on‑page counterforce (Lila present) keeps pressure just short of peak.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (trust in a fraught exchange and the cost of carrying mistakes) is legible and tightens with the lanterns’ approach and rain. The on-page conflict remains low-friction; the exchange has no visible snag, so escalation rests on cadence and internal stance. The final renunciation provides the price. A single sharper pressure on the hand-off would have elevated cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to keep navigating by inherited measures of regret or assume self‑direction—tightens once through the lighthouse confrontation. The price is legible: abandoning both the object and the identity scaffolding it offered. Escalation is quiet but coherent; the poles “misbehaving” and the needle’s uncertainty add pressure that resolves only with the explicit refusal. A slightly gentler middle beat keeps it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (can she reorient toward empathy) is clear and escalates through the encounter and the shattering alternate lives. The key tightening is the confrontation with possibilities and J.T.’s reframing, culminating in the vow. The price remains largely internal and lightly felt, with no hard trade‑off or foreclosed option beyond accepting burden. Tension holds but never quite bites.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure tightens credibly: refusal risks losing the bond; compliance risks self‑loss; the ritual’s progression forecloses retreat once the body begins to change. The meaningful turn is Lira choosing to sing and allow metamorphosis as the animals’ offerings arrive. The price is present but softened by the relative smoothness of the transformation, reducing edge. Still, the dominant stake remains coherent through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around the drive to bridge loss; tightening occurs as the crack widens, the tree reveals the backward city, and the choice to place The World forecloses waiting. Agency drives turns; coincidence (scent of lilacs) complicates but doesn’t resolve. The price—letting go of cloudbound atonement—registers, though it could be made more concrete. The fall and soft landing deliver a felt cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is strong: open the sealed dimension to save/stabilize the ship. Pressure tightens credibly from ship shuddering to the shadow confrontation and the dissolution of shadows around her ankles as a test of commitment. The price—the Tear’s destruction and surrender of avoidance—lands, though the internal struggle resolves a touch swiftly at peak. Escalation is agency-driven and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is internal—how Lira will approach change—which tightens when the man reframes her history and hands over the “last piece.” The meaningful turn is her decision to release and then to listen, allowing a stance crystallization. The price is felt but light, with no concrete loss or foreclosed path beyond a declared shift in approach. Tension lives in image and cadence rather than hard choices, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are signaled early (revolution vs. Council) and the meaningful turn is the hidden staircase revealing the cradle. Escalation is smooth; problems solve cleanly once Elara arrives, with no trade-off or loss to sharpen the choice. The blackout frames pressure but does not force a difficult decision. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens as each configuration raises potential catastrophe. The decisive turn is the renunciation of control in favor of witnessing, after the Möbius attempt nearly tips into annihilation. Prices are legible: risk of engulfment and the acceptance of a dimmer, steadier power. Pressure escalates coherently through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—voice versus censorship/self-censorship—is present from the first paragraph. Pressure tightens via the storm’s escalation and the envelope’s poem, culminating in the act of writing and sealing. The trade-off (safety vs. truth) is legible, though the cost is not tested on-page. The escalation is a meaningful deepening rather than a reversal, apt for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—win the duel vs. translate the map—tightens via the constellation reveal and culminates in a disarm that forces stance crystallization. The price is small but felt; victory is renounced for evolution. Escalation reads through coherent beats (stance shift → projection → blade at throat → choice). A bigger consequence would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—identity coherence vs. dissolution—tightens at the on-page molt and the discovery of the unfamiliar poem. The decision to accept becoming “the anarchy” rather than resist offers a credible internal turn. External pressure is modest, but Marla’s presence and the prison setting keep stakes grounded. The price is a chosen endurance of instability rather than resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (finding a refuge from fate/choice) is clear and tightens from “trance as cage” to the hidden‑room discovery and committed playing. Escalation is internal but coherent under the chosen lens, with a single decisive intensification. The price is modest yet present (renunciation of fixing/strategy and the ache/time deferral). A slightly sharper consequence on the page would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve collective memory before the monsoon) is signaled early. Escalation coheres through entering the dream risk, confronting the thesis of fear, and making the consequential choice to surrender the seed. The cost reads as a renunciation of doubt rather than a tangible loss, which keeps pressure strong but not punishing. The mirrors shatter/reform beat provides a single meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (recover/repair memory with the father) is signaled early and deepens as the lace moves from acknowledgment to forgiveness. The meaningful tightening occurs when the compass locks and the sea parts, forcing the on-page confrontation. Costs are emotional rather than tactical; resolution arrives without a hard trade-off or genuine risk of failure. Still, the escalation is coherent and accumulative under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—Elara's professional and intellectual identity—is clear and consistently pressured. The conflict is a masterful blend of internal struggle against her own rigorous training and external pressure from her uncomprehending colleagues.

    The stake—to understand and manipulate the "texture of time"—is established early and tested decisively. The escalation is well-handled, as Elara's action with the fragment triggers a chaotic surge that forces the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    The stake—to forge the sound of betrayal—is established immediately and remains the unwavering focus. The escalation is sharp and character-driven: when the initial mixture proves insufficient, Lira is forced into a more transgressive act (severing the memory-root), deepening the personal cost. The resolution is earned through this choice, and the price of her success is made unmistakable in the story's final, chilling lines.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake is clear and the escalation is masterful.

The price she pays is visible and directly linked to her decisive action, earning the resolution completely.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a way to protect curiosity—is established early and resolved with a meaningful internal transformation. The final choice to "abandon the search for perfect answers" represents a clear, felt cost. While the atmospheric pressure is constant, the escalation of tangible, external conflict is minimal, relying on a steady accumulation of insight rather than a sharp tightening of options under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—Lila's survival and self-definition—and escalates the pressure effectively through a causal chain of events culminating in the enforcer's arrival. The protagonist’s agency drives the resolution, and the cost is legible in the final scene. The physical confrontation is resolved a bit too quickly, slightly deflating the tension, but the overall escalation and stakes are handled with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    The central conflict—Mara's focused effort against the esoteric difficulty of her task—is expertly handled under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure deepens organically as the air thickens, the star fades, and the booklet sheds its skin. The resolution is earned entirely through her agency and endurance, and the cost (the loss of the star's light, the map's imperfection) is both tangible and thematically resonant, making the final moment of empowerment feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—to find the origin of thought—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The pressure escalates effectively when Unit-17 enters the temporal loop, facing an overwhelming influx of data. The tightening occurs with the realization that the program is a test, which reframes the stakes from mere curiosity to passing a final exam. The cost is legible in the robot’s transformation and the burden of awareness it now carries, which is a fitting price for this philosophical conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—Elias’s need to understand the forecourt's silent language—is established early and deepens effectively. The pressure intensifies not through external threats but through the escalating mystery and Lira's challenge to his worldview. The final choice to embrace this new role represents a clear, agency-driven resolution with the cost of his former certainty, which is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—intuitive humanity versus cold precision—is established early and tested directly in the scene. Joren’s challenge provides a clear tightening of pressure, forcing Elara to move from private philosophy to public demonstration. Her successful manipulation of the sensor is a decisive action that resolves the immediate conflict and proves her agency, with the cost being the lifelong effort her marbles represent.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    The conflict is well-defined and escalates effectively under a Causal lens. The initial professional stake (proving a theory) sharpens into an immediate survival stake (preventing catastrophic failure), creating a meaningful tightening. Veyra’s agency is central to resolving the crisis, and the cost—the realization of the immense danger and the endless nature of the work—lands with appropriate weight in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—proving the ghost's existence—is signaled early and escalates effectively into a higher-stakes commitment to complete his work.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—Lirael’s struggle between her prescribed role and a dangerous, intuitive truth—is established immediately and deepens effectively.

Lirael's agency in choosing to leave and seek a different kind of knowledge makes the resolution powerful, with the cost of her survival being her entire former life.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the secret of the "ghost shift"—is signaled early and escalates with purpose.

The final cost of this knowledge is made tangible and legible in the climax and resolution, foreclosing the romantic thrill-seeking that began the story.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—achieving a state of witness without judgment—is internal, but the conflict is expertly externalized through the physical journey.

The cost of success is legible and directly tied to the protagonist's choices, making the resolution feel earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara's worldview can influence Mara's—is established early and remains the focus. The deepening eclipse provides a natural escalation of atmospheric pressure.

The conflict is primarily philosophical and is resolved cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear, compelling metaphysical stake: to understand and reverse the world's silence.

The final turn is driven by his agency—an act of recognition—which provides an earned resolution with a clear consequence, satisfyingly closing the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s search for purpose and the truth about her father—is signaled early and escalates dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—unraveling reality before it stabilizes—is signaled early and pursued relentlessly. The story escalates pressure beautifully under its accumulative lens, with each layered rhetorical device serving as a meaningful turn that visibly affects the anchor.

The conflict is focused, coherent, and resolved through the protagonist's direct agency.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Lirael’s attempt to create meaning from memory before exhaustion claims her—is clear and personal. The pressure escalates accumulatively, culminating in the moment the shell flares, which serves as a meaningful deepening of her connection to the past.

The escalation is effective, with the environment pushing back against Elara's efforts via sparks and sudden chills, which creates good external pressure. Her agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story establishes a single, high-consequence stake—hushing a world-altering prophecy—and tests it directly. The escalation is clean and powerful: the appearance of the figure provides a tangible antagonist, and its spoken words ("The end begins") force Elias to intensify his efforts, creating a clear rise in pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.3)

    The dominant stake—retrieving the fragment—is signaled early and resolved through the protagonist's agency. The puzzle provides a meaningful tightening of pressure, forcing a shift from force to intuition.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake—understanding her grandmother's obsession—is signaled early and deepens with each discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes—personal identity versus historical truth—are established early and escalate effectively, particularly when Mara foresees her own death yet chooses to proceed.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the central stake (overcoming futility) is clear, the story lacks meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story signals a clear, professional stake that escalates into a much larger, elemental one due to the protagonist's own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—Zara's search for "strength in vulnerability"—and tests it through a single, meaningful escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)

The story achieves a meaningful deepening with the tern's cry and the introduction of *“Khalis,”* which re-contextualizes the coachman's struggle as a "narrow vastness of hope." This turn, driven by his unique perception, clarifies his resolve, and the cost of his work is made tangible by the fertilizer of "crushed bone and ash."

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—forging community connection—is clear, but the conflict lacks genuine pressure. Hush solves each riddle "in a flash" or "intuitively," with no struggle, misinterpretation, or risk of failure.

The escalation is a flat line of repeated successes, and the resolution, while thematically fitting, feels unearned by any meaningful hardship or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The external stakes are high and established early, and the conflict escalates effectively with each swapped piece, creating tangible pressure. Kael's agency is central to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story establishes a potent internal stake—reconciling performance and reality—and escalates it through a patient, accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Alaric's quest for self-forgiveness—is established immediately and tested directly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s internal battle against a sense of decay—is established immediately and effectively deepened through his journey into the cave. This physical act serves as a perfect external corollary for the internal risk, raising the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story’s dominant stake—proving the power of a whisper—is established early and held consistently. The primary tightening occurs when Thalos interrupts, creating a genuine threat to Elara’s goal.

The emotional cost is rendered with precision in the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—to navigate the geography of loss—is both poetic and concrete, signaled early and held throughout. Pressure escalates not through a single reversal, but through the steady accumulation of cryptic demands and the physical toll of the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story signals a strong dominant stake (psychological safety vs. dangerous truth) and executes one meaningful tightening when Mara uses the eye and confirms the ledger's existence. The pressure escalates well. The resolution, however, lacks a legible on-page cost; the choice is made, but the consequences remain abstract and future-facing, deflating the accumulated tension rather than crystallizing it with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The initial stake—solving the mystery—is effectively deepened when the woman reveals the captain's crime, escalating the conflict to a moral plane.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant internal stake—overcoming stagnation—is clearly signaled and effectively tested. The pressure escalates coherently as Lila moves from the mundane world into the supernatural cavern, culminating in a decisive choice. The final turn is not a physical victory but a conceptual one, where she reinterprets the "doorway," which constitutes a meaningful tightening of her options (foreclosing escape) and lands with the palpable cost of confronting her past.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central stake is established early and escalates effectively from internal disquiet to a direct supernatural confrontation. The queen demonstrates agency in seeking answers, and the resolution comes with a clear, legible cost. However, the climactic confrontation lacks dynamism; it functions more as a lecture from the entity than a true struggle, which slightly softens the pressure at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.0)

Lira’s agency drives the resolution, and the cost is the vicarious emotional burden she carries, which is reconfigured into connection by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding cosmic truth—is clear, but the pressure remains largely conceptual. The one significant tightening occurs when the mural figures appear, forcing the Witness to shift tactics from external exploration to internal confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story builds pressure masterfully around a single, dominant existential stake.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes deepen effectively from a technical problem to an existential one for the farm's living system. Kael's agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully escalates an internal, abstract stake—reconciling with a father’s intellectual legacy—into a tangible, high-pressure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)

The pressure escalates effectively from internal guilt to a direct confrontation with the consequences of his actions via Lira's demonstration.

The cost is the renunciation of old knowledge for a new, uncertain wisdom, a trade-off made tangible in the final, quiet confrontation with Voss.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is atmospheric—a "stillwater tension"—which is a valid stake for a textural story. The pressure deepens through Lira's sustained, focused action, and the resolution shows a clear, albeit quiet, change in the environment's emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake: Elias’s attempt to transform his grief into something purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a potent philosophical conflict between despair and the creation of a new system of meaning. The stake—whether this new way of seeing is viable—is successfully deepened when Mara is convinced, shifting the potential from individual survival to collective rebuilding. The final lines ("This is how we rebuild") crystallize the cost: one must abandon hope for the old world's return to create a new one. The pressure is coherent and escalates effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear, compelling philosophical stake early on: how to engage with dangerous knowledge. Kael's arrival provides immediate on-page pressure, forcing Lirael to defend her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving hope from shattering—is signaled early and coherently escalated by Thalos’s warning about the shadow's fragility. Lirael's agency drives the resolution. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; it is stated by Thalos ("luminous with regret") but not fully embodied by the protagonist, which slightly softens the impact of the final trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story locks onto a single, compelling internal stake—Lira’s need to reconcile her compassionate nature with a harsh world—and develops it with focused intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—freeing trapped creativity—is well-established and propels the narrative. The story escalates through a series of discoveries. The primary weakness is in the pressure and cost; the conflict is resolved without a meaningful trade-off or sacrifice from the protagonist. His success feels inevitable, which lessens the tension and the weight of his ultimate victory.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—the fading of imagination—is compelling and signaled clearly. The pressure deepens effectively when Kael understands the scope of the loss. The climax is driven by his agency, and the cost is legible. The escalation, however, is delivered primarily through dialogue from the woman, which is less impactful than if Kael had discovered or experienced the decay more directly himself.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering a primordial mode of thought—is signaled early and effectively deepened. The pressure builds texturally as Elara deciphers the forest's hum, culminating in a clear tightening when she must risk her one connection to her father.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant internal stake for Jorin: understanding his purpose in a world without clear paths. The pressure deepens effectively through the accumulation of strange encounters and Lira’s riddling wisdom. The climax is not a physical confrontation but a conceptual turn that reframes the entire mission, a powerful form of escalation for this narrative mode. The cost—accepting an endless, uncertain duty—is legible and deeply felt in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—the fortress’s fragile serenity—is established immediately and effectively threatened by Lady Veyra’s scream. This event serves as a meaningful tightening, forcing Elric out of his passive role. The resolution is driven by his agency, and the cost—the forfeiture of his silent, unseen existence for a new, vocal responsibility—is clear and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a clear, high-stakes conflict, and the "Silent Convergence" provides a solid temporal pressure point. However, the antagonistic force is entirely passive; the pretender is a static illusion, and his guards are easily evaded. The lack of a reactive opposition means Veyra never has to adapt her plan, which flattens the escalation and reduces the tension leading to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the disappearing paths—is established early and consistently drives the narrative. Pressure escalates effectively from intellectual curiosity to a high-stakes physical journey. The final decision to follow the path is a clear tightening that forecloses the option of staying, with the abandoned station representing a tangible cost for this choice.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—the rebellion's fading spirit—is established immediately and effectively. The story provides a single, meaningful tightening when Lira must convince the skeptical Jax, committing to her strange plan.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—how to handle a technology that can shape the future—is clear and compelling. The conflict escalates well through the discovery and retrieval process, with the plants' warning about the drones serving as a key tightening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—Lila’s ability to find peace amidst trauma—is clear and consistently tested. The conflict escalates effectively when an external trigger (the rattling gate) forces an internal crisis, demonstrating the fragility of her attempt at stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—finding answers about the vanished brother—and escalates the pressure effectively within its short frame. The conflict progresses from an information problem (locked drone) to a conceptual one (re-understanding time) and finally to a physical one (entering the tower). This tightening is driven entirely by Lira's agency, and the final choice to step inside pays a clear price: she is now inside the anomaly she sought, her path of return foreclosed for the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s struggle to inhabit her father's legacy—is established early and deepens throughout. The pressure accumulates through her interaction with the artifacts of his past. The key deepening occurs when she reinterprets "quiet" not as absence but as focus, a choice that crystallizes her mission. The cost is the full acceptance of this isolated, demanding life, a renunciation of the chaotic world beyond the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stake—understanding the chaotic constellations by capturing a goddess's echo—is established immediately and remains the clear focus.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes high stakes (“The dissonance will consume us all”) but the central conflict deflates in the climax. The promised confrontation with the scientists' collective guilt is reduced to a single, unopposed action. There is no struggle within the "labyrinth"; Lira is guided directly to a simple solution, which lessens the tension and makes the resolution feel too easily won.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—understanding the nature of the “emergent hush”—is established early and intensifies effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—a fracturing timeline—is established early and escalated effectively through the arrival of spirits. Elias's agency is undeniable as he orchestrates the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict deepens effectively under an accumulative lens, moving from scientific analysis to mystical communion when the heat-mapper reveals the "gold" threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake is clear but the conflict lacks meaningful friction or pressure. Mara finds the jar and intuits the solution with remarkable ease, facing no significant obstacles, setbacks, or risk of failure. The story presents a problem and its solution sequentially, and while the intensity deepens, it never translates into a compelling escalation that tests the character.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant internal stake—reclaiming courage—is established early and tested in the scene. The key tightening occurs when Mara hesitates before transcribing the codes, a moment where her paranoia clashes with her goal.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Within its Accumulative/Textural mode, the story establishes a clear philosophical stake: maintaining clarity against chaos. The pressure is subtle but coherent, deepening as Thaddeus moves from external observation to internal percolation during the crossing. While there is no traditional escalation, the journey serves as a sufficient intensification of his core practice. The cost—a life spent in quiet, repetitive observation—is felt rather than dramatized, which aligns with the story's serene tone but limits the conflict's visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—understanding the oasis's resilience—is established immediately and escalates effectively through a process of discovery. The climax deepens the stakes by revealing Mara's personal connection, making the conflict internal.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—Elias’s gentle persistence against Mara’s deep-seated grief—is established clearly and carries the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant internal stake—Lila's search for connection—is established early and tested in the climax. The pressure deepens effectively under an Accumulative lens, moving from observation (spiral) to choice (orb). However, the conflict lacks significant opposition; the external world provides a seamless path to resolution, and the cost of vulnerability, while felt, is not preceded by a difficult trade-off, limiting the tension's peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes—professional and societal—are established early and tested directly by Lila's actions. The escalation is clean, and her agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict escalates with impressive clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—solving the cold case through an alternative method—is established well. Pressure tightens effectively when they discover the indentation and handprint.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—vindicating an ancestor's legacy—is signaled early and escalates effectively from a historical mystery into a present-day crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding and accessing the pixelated amnesty—is established early and pursued actively.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.2)
    This is the story's most significant failure. The dominant internal stake is clear, but the external pressure meant to test it is completely absent from the page.

There is no on-page escalation, no visible cost, and no tension, rendering the protagonist's subsequent victory and peace feel unearned and hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the temple to find her brother—is established early and consistently drives the narrative.

The final choice is a direct result of this pressure and comes at a clear, legible cost, foreclosing her path of detached observation.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake—reconciling a fractured identity—is signaled early and escalated effectively when the "frozen confession" appears.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—mending the eclipsed covenant—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict deepens effectively when the double reveals the true failure is not in effort but in approach (“Chasing isn’t heeding”), which narrows Lirael’s options to a single, costly choice. The price of success—accepting the pain of both worlds—is made explicit and is paid on the page, resulting in an earned and impactful resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)

The conflict deepens effectively when Gus dismisses the cloth, forcing Lenny to choose between his professional mandate and a nascent personal conviction. This choice constitutes a meaningful turn with a clear, felt cost: rejecting monetary appraisal for the intangible value of story.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear intellectual and spiritual stake: re-establishing a fractured connection. The pressure builds effectively through atmospheric tension and Elara's internal uncertainty. The climax, where she places the seed and chants, represents a meaningful escalation, committing her to a path with unknown consequences. The resolution provides a visible cost—the manageable but endless work ahead—which is a sophisticated and earned trade-off for the knowledge gained.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a timeless world—is clear and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether to activate the network and connect the isolated survivors—is clear and intensifies effectively.

The choice to place the pearl has a visible cost (its dissolution) and a profound consequence (Elias's transformation), making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake—the navigation of guilt—and deepens it effectively through a series of discoveries. The realization that the maps are emotional is a meaningful turn that forces a change in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The core conflict (Lira vs. the cipher) is well-defined and drives the narrative forward with clear stakes. The escalation is steady as Lira pieces together the clues, culminating in her successful resolution through her own agency. However, the external pressure from the "second fateful letter" is mentioned but never truly felt on the page, functioning as a framing device rather than an active source of tension that forces a trade-off or raises the cost of her actions.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    The central conflict—a life of power versus a life of peace—is established immediately and held in taut suspension. The stakes are deeply personal and escalate as the abstract choice is rendered into two vivid, competing visions.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.4)
    Conflict and stakes are established immediately and escalate with precision. The shift from a technical challenge (infusing a weak chip) to an existential threat (the collapse of the grotto) is driven by the protagonist's own actions, a hallmark of strong conflict design.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—Lirael's search for contentment amidst fragile trust—and deepens it effectively with Elara's on-page appearance.

The pressure is primarily internal and well-handled, making the protagonist's agency in her final realization feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story effectively establishes Mira's internal stake—peace from guilt—and escalates the pressure by deepening Elias's understanding when he dons the cloak.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is subtle but effective, pitting Elara's pedagogical withholding against Lira's escalating need for understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding and preserving an ancient wisdom—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal, and the pressure deepens effectively when the birds arrive, presenting a specific pattern that challenges Kael's long-held assumptions.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—Kael's validation as a mage—is signaled early and tested directly. The narrative tightens when the spire forces him to look inward, shifting the conflict from mastering an external power to accepting an internal truth. The final choice to use the sketch has a clear, felt cost: he renounces the pursuit of "impossibilities" in favor of personal meaning, which resolves the conflict decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    The internal stake—whether Elias will confront his grief—is clear and compelling. Pressure escalates effectively through his physical journey from the known pier to the unknown, submerged library. The discovery of the pristine room behind door "13" acts as a decisive deepening, forcing a direct confrontation with the past.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the prophecy before the universe finishes contracting—is clear and compelling. The conflict is effectively internalized as Kael’s struggle with doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—finding a new purpose after failure—and escalates it effectively.

The resolution is earned through his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)

    The story establishes a powerful, singular stake—restoring lost joy—and escalates the conflict beautifully through an accumulative deepening of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)

    The dominant stake—Elara's understanding of narrative origins—is established early and meaningfully tightened by the stranger's request.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding her grandmother’s silence—is expertly externalized in the physical conflict with the locked diary.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story effectively escalates pressure under an accumulative lens, moving from a quiet survey to a physical struggle against the wind and a tense discovery. The dominant stake—understanding the crash—is clear and deepens with the personal connection to her mentor.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes high stakes (a plague antidote) and executes a clear escalation by introducing the security drones as a physical threat. The critical weakness lies in the conflict's resolution. The drones, an external, mechanical threat, are defeated by a "defiant waltz" and the "chaos of his rhythm"—a purely symbolic and thematic victory that feels entirely unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    The central stake—uncovering and acting on the library's secret—is signaled early and escalates effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake—overcoming quarantined isolation—is established immediately and deepens effectively when the abstract whisper becomes the specific, painful memory of abandonment.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story excels at translating a vast, abstract stake (the fate of empires) into a singular, tangible act. The key moment of pressure—pricking her thumb with the cursed thorn—serves as a perfect deepening of the conflict, making the cost of her mission embodied and immediate.

    Dominant stake of saving vanishing arts signals early, with one meaningful deepening as Elias's violin joins the zither, tightening pressure under the accumulative lens by reweighting discord into unity and foreclosing isolation with felt cost of external borders hardening. Agency in Clara's urging to play and humming creates a micro-turn that crystallizes stance, interweaving internal fear with external division without coincidence resolving. However, stakes remain somewhat abstract, with the ethical calculus between hatred and harmony not sharply testing commitment through a visible trade-off in the peak moment. The closure reconfiguration lands earned, but escalation could narrow options more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake of creating beauty from ruins signals early and tightens meaningfully under Accumulative/Textural lens via the alignment's pressure, forcing stance crystallization in persistent pruning that narrows options from trauma to potential.

Agency drives escalation through her deliberate cuts, earning the reconfiguration without multiple reversals needed at this length. Moral calculus between clinging to past pain and guiding growth sharpens the peak choice effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake in preserving wonder escalates through the drone failure and riddle revelation, tightening to Clara's public declaration under Causal lens pressure; however, Voss's exposition resolves tension too conveniently without protagonist-driven reversal, making cost feel abstract rather than viscerally narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake of understanding living houses signals early and deepens through object arrangement, with one meaningful cadence shift under Accumulative/Textural lens as the glow forces stance crystallization on hush as potential. Agency in Lira's ritual forecloses doubt with visible cost in the thickened air and trembling objects. Strength in coherent pressure without coincidence resolving; weakness in abstract stakes that feel less viscerally tested at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake in curing the blight tightens through revelations, deepening via Lumen's projections that narrow options and force Mara's decision to drink, with felt cost in accepting her grandmother's transformation. Under Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates via impressions, earning a stance crystallization, though coincidence in stumbling upon the garden slightly complicates without fully resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake of unlocking the stone to defy fate signals early and tightens causally when the initial spin fails, forcing modification and deepening pressure; one reversal narrows options, leading to agency in the feedback loop. Cost is legible in the stone's deeper hunger and Elias's terror, charging the final image under Causal lens. Coherent pressure crystallizes his stance, but coincidence of the yoyo's symbols mirroring the stone complicates without fully resolving, limiting escalation depth. The moral calculus between invention and fate's risk sharpens the peak, but lacks a second optional accent.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake of tricking fear signals early and tightens causally when the shadow appears, forcing a paradoxical confrontation that narrows options and culminates in dissolution with legible cost in seared skin and wailed scream. Agency drives escalation through Mara's welcoming lie and grip on the thread, foreclosing fear's power. One deepening suffices, but coincidence in the thread's appearance slightly complicates without fully resolving. Moral calculus between illusion and truth sharpens the peak, though internal-external weave is optional and lightly present.

    Dominant stake of decoding the frequency tightens once through the lever pull, narrowing options under Causal lens and forcing stance crystallization on belonging. Agency in grappling and pulling earns the reconfiguration with felt cost in the heartbeat-matching waveform. Pressure coheres but remains somewhat abstract, with no secondary accent or ethical calculus sharpening the choice. Coincidence of pilgrim's arrival complicates without resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under Accumulative/Textural lens, the dominant stake of quelling Lila's panic through truth escalates via pattern of driftwood visions that deepen knowledge and reweight guilt's cost, forcing stance crystallization with one meaningful tightening sufficient for length. Agency in Elias's decision to reveal the brother forecloses lying, with felt price in potential betrayal. Pressure coheres, narrowing options from manufacturing memories to honesty. Pivotal moment of gasping at the brother's erasure drives the peak choice, though coincidence of finding exact carvings slightly complicates without resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake of trust in the exchange tightens through coherent pressure from arriving parties, forcing Clara's stance crystallization in dialogue; under Accumulative lens, cadence shift at the drop reweights cost legibly, with agency in her renunciation foreclosing past regrets at emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake of relearning empathy tightens causally through the visions, forcing a deepening that narrows options with visible cost in the shattering mother image; however, pressure feels somewhat static until the encounter, lacking a mid-story reversal to heighten agency, though the closure reconfiguration lands with conceptual price.

Coincidence (Elara's timely arrival) complicates without resolving, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake of restoring sacred order tightens through accumulating visions and rock adjustments, with a meaningful deepening when the storm vision forces reconfiguration, narrowing options under the Accumulative lens; cost is felt in her terror and tears, charging the final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can rigorous metrics map organic decay?—tightens when dust patterns resist prediction. One deepening: the monarch’s spiral forces her to accept unpredictability. Cost is the institute’s scoffing; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—re-purpose life after survival—tightens via frost-lead map, shard revelation, and final renunciation of studio vases. Escalation is steady pressure of “hollow” vs “pause-truth,” culminating in a cost visible on page: she forsakes old art for teaching, accepting uncertain drift.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—proving silence can be expressive—is signaled early and tightened through each experiment; the moment the first audible note emerges narrows options irrevocably. Agency is continuous: Lirael chooses to map memories, to let Elias stay, to release the compositions publicly. Cost is visible: the original scream swallowed by storm is never reclaimed; instead she forfeits conventional music for an unvoiced art. No coincidence resolves; all escalation is driven by her iterative choices.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—survival vs. solidarity—is signaled early (“sanctions had crippled the community”). One decisive tightening occurs when Mira rings the bell and names the givers, forcing a trade-off between secrecy and mutual aid. The cost is legible: anonymous safety forfeited for open reciprocity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“where is unused love stored?”—is signaled early and deepened through the breathing method. One meaningful tightening: the pool’s revelation forecloses documentation in favor of embodiment. Cost is legible but diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—grasping time’s texture—tightens when the fragment’s activation forces a trade-off: pursue total unraveling or accept stabilized memory. Escalation is one decisive intensification under Accumulative lens; cost is the loss of retrocognitive access. Agency is clear, though external pressure remains largely metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—plant resilience before scavengers arrive—is signaled early and escalates as keys click and footsteps echo. The final tightening is the star key’s blood-sharp points forcing a trade-off: freedom now or seeds never. Cost is visible in snapped cuffs and glowing vines, though the scavengers’ threat could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“to find the sound of trust breaking”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through each harvested absence; the severed root delivers the decisive intensification. Cost is felt in the final tone that “echoes the exact moment trust fractured.” Agency is high; coincidence never rescues. Secondary stakes (mother’s silence) remain atmospheric, not tested.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—steal moonbeams—signaled at once. Pressure escalates via lock, floor, guard; the photo trade is the decisive tightening that forecloses pure theft. Cost is felt, though escalation is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“vulnerability as power”—is tested when Lila weaponizes her phobia to dodge the enforcer. One meaningful tightening: the decrypted notes narrow her options to confront or flee. Cost is the irreversible public exposure of her mother’s crimes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—map the endless night—tightens once when the last star vanishes, forcing completion. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the cost remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—origin of thoughts—signaled early. Escalation occurs via iterative loops that narrow options until Unit-17 chooses stasis. Cost is conceptual (infinite knowledge traded for quiet service) rather than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: can Elias move from passive logging to active listening? Pressure tightens when the ticket’s map forces a decision; the crystals’ hum escalates stakes from curiosity to responsibility. Cost is visible: he forfeits the safety of written records. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—proving human touch still matters—escalates through Elara’s deliberate sabotage of a sensor; the tightening forces the maze to recalibrate, narrowing options. Cost is visible (time, risk of being lost), but the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove time’s non-linearity—is signaled early and tested when the nexus destabilizes. Escalation is a single, coherent tightening: overcompensation → thrashing creatures → urgent recalibration. Cost is visible—Veyra’s sweat, the station’s shudder—but the price feels technical more than personal. Agency is clear; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove the ghost by decoding the symphony—tightens once when the water-damaged symbols crystallize into the opening bars. Cost is legible: loss of the program, soaked clothes, irreversible commitment. No false escalation; coincidence (broken pipe) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—station’s impending collapse vs. public cover-up—escalates via cause-of-action: Lirael chooses stolen illustration to confront her own complicity. Staticed readings & muffled evac whispers raise immediate pressure. Closure choice (abandon post) forecloses her career path with wrought cost—“weighted heavier each day” is visible in textual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the swallowed truth”—escalates from rumor to revelation via the valve’s turn, narrowing Elias’s options to witness or flee. The hologram’s confession tightens pressure; the cost is the unburdened knowledge he must now carry. No false reversals; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—silence without judgment—is signaled early and tightened through each fold; the cost is the keeper’s eroding identity, visible in the shattered reflection. One clear deepening suffices, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—can childhood wonder survive disenchantment—is signaled early and advanced by each beat. Tension escalates when Mara’s palm warms under the curl, narrowing skepticism’s room; the only unmet lift is higher concrete cost accompanying renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—retrieve or lose the dragon stories—clarifies early and tightens when Clara’s “axis shifted” threat surfaces. One clear deepening occurs when Elias realises the displacement is perceptual, not spatial, forcing the final act of acknowledgment. Cost is palpable in the ending thrum. A soft beat: smoke-carrying ritual summarised not dramatised, sapping maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender to inherited manipulation—tightens when the letters reveal her unwitting complicity. The single decisive turn: she chooses to keep orchestrating but on her terms, cost marked by the flare and the unread future of the dockworker’s choice. Pressure escalates cleanly under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preventing dimensional erasure—is signaled early and tightened by each loop. Escalation is Accumulative: each rhetorical layer increases the anchor’s strain until rupture. Agency is intellectual (posing paradoxes), not visceral; the priest never faces a forked choice with personal cost. Still, the final reconfiguration forecloses return to stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory-as-music—tightens via rhythmic exhaustion clock plus fortune-by-fortune density; no concrete price is extracted before closure keeps it just sub-9/0.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“to conquer the labyrinth of self”—tightens when each timeline forecloses a version of Mara. The right-path choice deepens cost: loss of perpetual flight for uncertain groundedness. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than external antagonist, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightened when the reversed music forces a trade-off: surrender to ache or remain numb. Agency is decision to play backward; cost is the sudden weight of feeling. One meaningful escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—understand scent-triggered sorrow—tightens once via UV reveal; the memory flood raises emotional cost and forecloses avoidance. Escalation is single but sufficient; price is visible in tears and later unflinching inhalation. No slack reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“texture of time” via impossible choices—tightens once when Kael must unravel or keep the rope; the deepening is legible, but the price (loss of past possibilities) is more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—loosen the knot of grief—is signaled early. The tightening occurs when the bowl begins to vibrate, forcing Lira to reframe silence as potential. The price is the crowd’s fragile, audible risk, but the escalation is more cadence shift than irreversible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s ethic of balanced half-truths—is signaled early and tightened when Lira’s request tests it; the trade-off (joy for sorrow) is named but not viscerally paid by Elias. One meaningful deepening: the petal’s faint residual scent marks the cost of another transaction. Agency remains Elias’s continual recommitment to the craft. Pressure is coherent but mild; no new option is foreclosed for him.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—shifts from cargo to compassion, but external forces (gust, unnoticed shells) drive most reversals; escalation is sympathetic, not Clara-initiated.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rekindling community via Veyra—escalates through each discovered tag, tightening the search. The final reveal narrows options from solitary quest to shared bond, but the cost (lost anonymity for Lira, emotional exposure for Kael) is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the breathing canals’ secret—tightens when the fissure opens and time thickens. The cost (irreversible knowledge, possible imbalance) is implied rather than dramatized on exit, keeping escalation vivid but not viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Ambiguous loss is the engine: each drip confronts Elara’s refusal; the stone asks for an answer; the final image charges “grief is live geometry.” Stakes compress to a single felt question without sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—becoming visible to help the unseen—tightens once when the tape’s message forces Mara to risk exposure by caching the decoder. Escalation is textural: each crawl, hum, and flicker increases the cost of remaining hidden. Agency is renunciation of absolute invisibility; price is future vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    The single dominant stake—Eleanor’s need to dominate versus the plants’ imperative to transform—escalates credibly under pressure. The hellebore’s retraction offers one visible, on-page test that forecloses the “control” option. No coincidence resolves the issue; the shift is driven by observing plant behavior and a conscious renunciation. Cost appears at the end: permanent alteration of her work identity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—control over everyday magic—tightens when the pearl fractures the cave’s harmony, forcing Elara to accept the darkness threading the light. One clear intensification suffices; cost is the irreversible change in the cave’s song and her own sensorium.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    Single dominant stake—harbor history reclaimed—is clear; pressure tightens through journal revelation and fisherman testimony, but escalation flattens when social restoration turns into ceremonial blowing without showing the real reintegration cost.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure mounts through the narrowing arrows and mist-chilled hesitation; the escalation is coherent but feels like a single iteration rather than layered costs, so options narrow only once.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes grow as Clara moves from private curiosity to literal obsession—her choice to transcribe the ancient code narrows her options and guarantees confrontation with memory-cost; however, external stakes (e.g., what the code might reveal to her career) remain underexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—escape eternal stasis—is signaled early. Escalation is a single tightening: storm weakens amulets, forcing the joint renunciation. Agency is shared, but Kael’s micro-choice to press fragments together carries visible cost (loss of immortality anchor). Pressure remains coherent under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—protect father’s formula—tightens when agents threaten her. Escalation is one smooth arc: conceal → reveal → negotiate. Agency is active; the ink pot enables the reversal. Cost (loss of scroll) is visible, though emotional sting could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—collecting “textures of different times”—is signaled early and deepens when the lamp synchronizes with her breath, tightening the pattern. However, the escalation is observational rather than adversarial; no tangible price is extracted, so pressure plateaus.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—reclaim erased identity—signaled early; escalation delivered in single revelation laced with conceptual cost (living ghost). Agency limited, discovery accrued rather than tactics altered under pressure. One deepening effective, tide clock used atmospherically not mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“prove the riddle isn’t madness”—tightens when the shell-cello fusion forces a choice between explanation and empathy. The pressure deepens with each resonant beat until the final reconfiguration. Cost is felt (she gives up debunking) but less visceral than the thematic payoff, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—privatization vs soul—tightens when spiral-square deadline appears; Lira’s graffiti-map gambit forecloses sterile grid option. Cost is visible: Council’s icy scoff, Jax’s torch, collective murmur of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—leaving a human mark before automation erases it—tightens once when the drones’ ETA appears. The cost is conceptual (obsolescence), but the on-page price is muted; she loses nothing tangible except time already spent.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“find where rivers begin”—is signaled early and tightened when the map reveals light beneath ice. One decisive turn: she chips the ice, trading safety for knowledge. Cost is visible (half-buried, raw voice) but not deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal harmony—is signaled early and deepens as footsteps multiply. Pressure tightens once when the bell rings, but the cost is borne by the town, not the protagonist, slightly muting personal stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—harness the ephemeral—is signaled early and tightened when the hush’s prison nature is revealed. One meaningful turn: Mara overrides her instinct to flee, choosing release under rising storm pressure. Cost is legible in the empty vial and dissolved voices. Agency drives escalation; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—overwrite the father’s false stories—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: the lattice demands authorship, forcing Elias to choose story over escape. Cost is the chamber’s collapse and the looming discovery of bodies. Pressure stays coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; the copperlight’s shift to silver marks the decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—settling the centuries-old debt—is signaled early and tightens when Elara activates the bead. One clear escalation: the fruit splits into a vortex that forecloses the ghost’s lingering. Cost is legible but abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore reverence from ruin—is signaled early and tightened once: the merging of plates forecloses retreat; the cost is the plates’ emptied purpose. Pressure escalates via accumulative density of glowing threads rather than causal reversals. A crisper articulation of what Lira personally loses would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—faith restoration—is implicit in shrine resurrection and made legible by harmonic tone & village draw. One micro-turn—choosing to follow the thread instead of abandoning it—lands with atmospheric rather than concrete price. Pressure arcs from curiosity through labor to communal arrival; each beat tightens via textured accumulation rather than antagonistic risk; cost is atmospheric but perceptible.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—decode the grandmother’s legacy—escalates through each chalk clue and tightens when the fountain key demands physical risk. Agency is continuous: every scan, dip, and insertion narrows options. Cost is palpable: Lira accepts lifelong anonymity. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve hidden star-truths before the coup—is signaled early and tightens when the council moves the telescopes. One meaningful deepening: the flame’s synchronizing power is revealed, narrowing options to covert embroidery. Cost is conceptual (risk of discovery) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—grafting meaning onto ruin—tightens when Lira translates the child’s fear into usable hope. The single escalation beat (placing coral between factions) narrows options and carries visible social risk. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaim joy from silence—is signaled early and tightens once: the display transforms private elegy into communal resurrection. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each added light-word and remembered story increases density until the fog literally thins. Cost is visible in Lira’s trembling and the irreversible exposure of her solitude. No coincidences resolve the conflict; the crowd’s revival is a direct consequence of her chosen action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the mural’s hidden memory—tightens when the nickel’s harmonics force a trade-off: knowledge gained, innocence lost. One clear escalation beat; cost is legible in the final “rhythm” she now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—access to covert communication—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the pheromone test narrows options; failure would eject Elias. Cost is conceptual (future surveillance) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake of trade-off between pain and beauty is sharpened, but escalation slips into year-summaries. Charged stillness at end meets threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent the orchids from releasing extinct feelings—is signaled early and tested when the chime fails. Escalation is one deepening: Lirael’s childhood hum → grandmother’s lullaby → new hybrid song, each step narrowing her options toward accepting imperfection. The cost is the emotional forfeiture of absolute preservation; the orchids now bloom fiercer but no longer under perfect control. Agency is continuous; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restore trust before the wedding—intensifies with each translated promise; the sister-manuscript tightens the emotional vise. The final phone call is a visible price: surrendering scholarly detachment for raw vulnerability. Escalation is causal and linear; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—decrypting compassion before the volcano’s next breath—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via the adhesive’s micro-fractures and the chain’s measurements; the tightening is one coherent intensification rather than multiple reversals. The cost is the emotional weight of the sender’s trust now resting on her.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve or bury the echo—tightens when the dust reveals a time-map, forcing Elias to abandon the safety of courier anonymity. Escalation is causal: each decoded symbol raises the cost of silence. The price is felt when he ignores client notes and locks the shop door behind him.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—escalates as each decoded symbol narrows Lira’s options until only the light-door remains. The cost (permanent exile from the terrace) is legible but could be sharper on the page; it’s more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“to learn the rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early and tightened once via the alignment’s crescendo, but the cost is collective awe rather than a personal trade-off. Agency is observational; no option is foreclosed for Mara herself. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—why paths disappear—tightens once when Lira presses seeds into glass and the shard clears; this single deepening reweights the mystery. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no external reversals, but the fog-wall image narrows options with visible regret.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—proving chaos can be conducted—escalates as Lira’s dissonant sequence tightens the crowd’s drift. The cost is the loss of her own anonymity and the surrender of control at the final silence; the price is legible but lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    A single, dominant stake—renew the constellations or remain hollow—tightens through escalating pressure of the ban and the burning stylus. Only one decisive escalation occurs; the cost is visible but brief. Agency remains clear: she writes, she burns, she accepts exile.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—finding value in the mundane—is more thematic posture than escalating pressure. Conflict is static appreciation; no tightening or felt tradeoff until the quiet closure, which softens rather than deepens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—translate pain into universal language—tightens once when the hourglass’s flow reframes memory. Escalation is accretive: each remembered scream layers until the stance crystallizes. Agency is present in opening the box and tipping the glass; cost is the emotional exposure, though external stakes remain internal.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stake—prove that “equations for hope” can be physical—is stated first paragraph; pressure escalates each time the gauge flips, foreclosing the earlier “it can’t be this simple.” A single reversal at the climax (needle stops at 17, a non-numeral of her universe) crystallizes cost: her own literal strand traded for possibility. No second obstacle complicates; one meaningful squeeze suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—carry the walls’ memory—tightens when the groan forces a choice: keep or surrender the negative. One clear escalation beat; cost is the forfeited heirloom. No reversals, but the deepening reconfigures her mission from discovery to embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show extra-reflective possibilities—is signaled early and escalates through each mirror’s glow. The tightening is the third mirror’s forest path, which crystallizes her choice to release the song fully. Cost is visible exhaustion, yet the trade-off (what she forfeits) remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.6)
    Pressure builds via delegate hostility, sun arc, and clipboard ritual—the “price” concept tightens stakes. No external reversals, only gradual erosion and modest cost; sufficient for sub-800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether the echo can be preserved—tightens when the egg is placed and water poured; the cost is the certain extinction and the self-inflicted drought. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. The price is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate the echoes—signals early. Pressure tightens once: threads glow, energy builds, then release. Cost is felt (faster breath, cold) but remains light; no credible loss or irreversible trade-off is dramatized. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can Elias test an ethical story mode under live scrutiny—tightens when the drifter scoffs and Mara reframes the campfire metaphor. The reversal of roles forces a public stance with reputational cost, satisfying the single meaningful turn required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and tightened once when the monarch lands; the cost is the lattice’s transience. Agency is present (knotting, waiting, releasing) but the escalation is gentle, more accretive than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the sound of forgotten names”—is tested at every braid alignment, with felt risk of losing the fragile card and the rope’s fray giving way. The decisive tightening occurs when each misaligned thread could silence Lira again; agency is pure micro-choice under glacial constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—seal a covenant with the unknown—is signaled early and tightened when the wall slides open. Agency drives each beat: placing tiles, answering the voice. Cost is visible (tile edges bite palm), but escalation plateaus once the chamber opens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—teaching release—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure escalates only by accumulation of visitors, not by deepening stakes or narrowing options. No visible price is paid by Lirael; the cost is off-loaded to visitors.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightened when Elias realizes the mirrors must map “the space between.” The synchronized breathing beat narrows options to joint ritual, forcing a visible trade-off of solitude. Cost is felt in the stranger’s vanishing and Elias’s unending vigilance. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—keep the orchard alive—faces a single decisive test: mend the eye or lose the grove. Escalation is modest but coherent; the crack in the quartz eye tightens the pressure, and the cost (sacrificing the ribbon) is visible. No external antagonist needed; the breach functions as off-stage pressure that has already narrowed options.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nonlinear legacy concept steadily escalates: tree names = prior legatees, shell portraits = future selves, forcing Elara to choose inclusion/exclusion of her own name—cost crystallized by the final chime.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—access to erased knowledge—tightens when the guardian demands proof of ignorance. One clear escalation: decoding the Silence shelf under threat of failure. Cost is visible—Elara’s public admission of ignorance—though the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the garden or remain nameless—is tested by Veyra’s doubt and the ship’s entropy. One decisive tightening: Lira’s choice to sew their name into soil forecloses retreat to the ship. Cost is the ship’s erasure and the irreversible exposure of their fused identity.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translate chaos into order—tightens when the gear jams and the door’s glow demands a precise braid reconfiguration. One visible cost: sparks and chill signal stakes rising; the final scroll reweights the conflict into stewardship of lost knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restore silence without destroying the energy beings—is signaled early and tightened through escalating sensory assault. The spiral examination and bloom conjuring constitute one decisive beat that forecloses continued dissonance. Cost is visible in physical pain and the irreversible tonal shift. Agency remains with the mapkeeper; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—rekindle the beacon to shatter the hush—is signaled early and tightened when the storm threatens to erase progress. Agency is continuous: each alignment narrows options until the final slam of shard into mosaic forecloses retreat. Cost is visible (blood, isolation) and felt. Coincidence (moonbeam) complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—outrunning past failure—tightens when the note forces a choice: ignite the lilies and risk repeating harm, or retreat; the single escalation is sufficient and the price (memory of scars) is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can Elara translate her tidal foresight into human connection—tightens once when she risks the cicada nudge. Cost is relational vulnerability; Kael’s softening shows the pressure landed. No reversals, but one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—dissonance beneath dazzle—is signaled first sentence. Pressure escalates through incremental texture: chaotic readings, sudden stillness, then cost visible in route renunciation. No extraneous sub-plots; single tightening crystallizes choice. Coincidence limited to train-whistle echo which functions as liminal catalyst, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find stairway before sunrise”—is signaled early and tightened by flickering light and collapsing steps. Sunrise clock visibly alters tactics, yet the spectral guardian’s demand feels more conceptual test than escalating pressure, keeping the peak beat slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—holding the line against oblivion—tightens when Kael crosses the threshold; the cost is the sanctuary’s shudder and Elara’s admission of need, but escalation plateaus rather than deepens after the crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“harvest diamonds before implosion”—is signaled early and tightens when Mara must decide whether to trust the device. One meaningful turn (turning the bolt) narrows options and averts collapse. Cost is present but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncover truth vs. preserve ancestral silence—tightens once when the letters reveal the dynasty’s self-erasure. Escalation is driven by Lirael’s agency (turning the crank, pressing the handle). Cost is legible: she forfeits the myth of tragic downfall for the burden of conscious rebirth. Slight abstraction in “too dangerous to speak” keeps it shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled on page one and tightens when the line changes to “descend.” Escalation is Accumulative: each pattern break (program, vines, orb) intensifies the cost of knowing. The final choice to walk away forecloses the capture path with felt weight. One beat shy of 8.8: the price of orb-shattering could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether the lost deserve narrative rescue—surfaces early and tightens once when the button’s date collides with the boy’s timeline. Pressure is textural rather than causal: the weight of absence presses Elias toward the new folder. A visible cost is implied but not dramatized on the page; the ache remains retrospective. Sufficient for this length, but the lack of an immediate trade-off caps the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—expose erased histories—is signaled early and tightened when the terminal reveals the Council’s directive; the alarm and explosion force an irreversible trade-off, cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—is signaled early and tightened when the figure speaks; Elias’s agency drives the escalation via saxophone counter-music. Cost is visible in burning lungs and lingering unease. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the leaf-message—tightens once when moonstone dust makes markings legible. Escalation is a single deepening rather than a reversal; the cost is the irrevocable dissolution of the dust and the new burden of warning others. Agency is clear, though external stakes (storm, Lirael) remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake—truth vs. certainty—tightens when the compass refuses north; the plunge and recovery raise cost, though coincidence (storm-upturned hatch) slightly dilutes agency.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—redeem self by bridging seen/unseen—tightens when coin fuses and Lira offers irreversible renunciation. One meaningful deepening suffices; cost is visible in the fused coin and vanished sister.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capture laughter for healing—is signaled early and tightened when the keeper declares laughter “a language of the living.” One meaningful turn: Lira’s admission of fear narrows options and enables the translation beat. Cost is felt in the keeper’s disappearance and the ache she carries out.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can mercy be measured?—tightens when the woman’s “choice not equation” forces Elias to renounce the math and endure uncertainty. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, but the cost (burning spores, retained strap) is on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: retrieve fragment to mend a drowned world’s memory. Pressure escalates via sensory density and clue-tracing; cost is the memory she relinquishes to free the shard. No external antagonist; agency is attention and pattern-recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped ghosts—escalates through Elias’s escalating physical engagement (kneel → climb → pry). One meaningful deepening occurs when the photograph reveals the clown’s identity, tightening the emotional cost of release.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—rupture vs. preservation of order—signaled early; pressure escalates via the frost anomaly and frantic press rhythm, narrowing to the decisive print run. Cost is legible in the shattering whisper and patrons’ terror, though Elara’s personal price is less visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prove Luminari fraud—tightens when Kael’s mirror-covering gambit forces a public test; escalation is driven by his agency (planting fungi, draping mirrors) with visible cost (heretic label); the storm’s temporal rips complicate but do not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“reclaim the light stolen by midnight”—tightens when the stone flares only after Lira’s admission; agency is hers, not Elias’s, which slightly dilutes pressure. One clear cost: the lullaby is gone, replaced by raw truth; escalation is single but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is early—seize untainted memory/parfait. One deepening beat: compass vibration forces retreat, foreclosing exploration and raising ontological cost. The loss is felt (hum in the quiet) but escalation stays quiet rather than sharply tightening under a causal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decipher the island’s history or remain lost—is signaled early and tightens when the lantern slide reveals ancestral covenants. The single deepening beat (portal crossing) narrows Lira’s options from observer to guardian. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the price of guardianship is felt but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode grandmother’s secret—is signaled early and tightens through each glass layer deciphered. Escalation is textural: each new etching reweights the mystery rather than narrows options causally. Cost is conceptual (fear of being seen, Elias’s confession) rather than visceral. One deepening beat: violet glow reveals inscription that reframes the quest. Agency remains intellectual; no tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“uncover truth before erasure”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara sees her own death in the tunnels. One decisive turn: triggering the trapdoor, trading codex for life. Cost is visible (blank diary, lost codex) and narrows future options.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reimagining a civilization—escalates through accumulating artifacts and memory density; the tightening occurs when the bottle glows and the ghosts begin to materialize. Cost is felt in Elias’s exhaustion and tears, but the external pressure feels more spectral than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Voss decode the prophecy and what will he do—tightens when the harmonic hum matches the foghorn’s silence, forcing the choice to archive rather than avert. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the acceptance of inevitable awakening. No reversals needed; pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Central stake—restore life-path or drown in chaotic time—tightens through each seed-splinter beat. The oak sprout acts as decisive reversal/charged poise, but cost is abstract (conceptual, not visceral) at closure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—harmony between bell and storm—escalates when Lira’s switch accelerates the weather. The tightening is coherent, though the external cost (community preparation) is implied more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early; the star’s death provides one deepening pulse. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed until the final image, keeping pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    Central conflict is the covenant that utterance must free the unheard; escalation flows from ghost coercion to the final spoken words. The stakes crystallize when Elias must risk his vow of silence to discharge the ghosts, narrowing options effectively at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover the texture of time”—is signaled early and tightened when the capsule’s damage is revealed as entropy’s victory. One meaningful deepening: broken mechanisms still pool stillness, forcing Elias to renounce numerical time. Cost is felt in the urn fragment’s relinquishment.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are quietly stated: harmonize discord through transient art. Pressure tightens once when the kite falls, but the escalation is more tonal than consequential; no visible price is paid beyond the inevitable unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—interspecies harmony before death—tightens once: spirit’s question “Why?” forces Lira to articulate the bridge’s cost. Escalation is one deepening beat; no reversals needed. Price is her remaining life, visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—homecoming’s authenticity vs engineered nostalgia—converges cleanly. Escalation is single but meaningful: footprints → sculpture trigger → mist activation → visceral longing; it forces a stance crystallization. Amber, vial, and tower all apply pressure rather than simply decorate. No external coincidence steps in; tension rests solely on Lirael’s choice to touch the sculpture. Cost is interior (“chest ache”), visible; tactics shift from analytical observation to surrendered introspection.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—redeeming a dead reef through a salt-strangled garden—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: storm clouds swallow the last light, forcing the coachman to leave the nascent plot to fate. Cost is visible (time, exposure, memory ash) but not yet paid, so pressure is legible but not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“translate distance into closeness”—tightens as each solved riddle forecloses isolation; communal cheers mark visible price paid. One clear deepening beat: Hush’s bark after the final riddle crystallizes the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether exile will calcify or liberate—tightens when the glimpse freezes the sky and the compass points backward. The cost is felt in the smeared ink and the grandmother’s vanishing, but the external pressure (reactor spasms) is off-stage, muting the visceral price compared to the interior shift.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—prevent collapse of Aetheria—escalates through each swap’s tremor and whine, tightening Kael’s options. The final swap crystallizes the cost (silence vial) and narrows his identity, though the price feels borne by the city more than by him.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—document unseen gestures vs. succumb to gallery’s silence—tightens when the king topples and she must choose reverse-walk or stasis. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the ache of scars and the dawn exile with board in hand.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“shape of home”—tightens when the stone’s mirror demands Lirael seed her own truth. Escalation is one deepening beat: feather contact → cavern → skin-embedded shards. Cost is the obsidian shards themselves, altering her forever.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when the black thread forces confrontation with the prince’s death; the winnowing action narrows options to acceptance or endless guilt. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the memory’s “mix of betrayal and fear.”

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—shatter the elders’ monolithic truth—escalates through Kael’s escalating poetic defiance; the light burst forces a visible trade-off (heretic label tomorrow). One deepening beat suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning from ruin—is signaled early and escalates through one decisive tightening: the realization the charm must scar her, not the statue. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never rescues. The final choice (remove respirator) forecloses safety with visible cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; one deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to live with time’s fractures—is signaled early via the cracked mirror. Pressure tightens once: the wrong turn forces a stance crystallization in the cavern. Cost is conceptual (he forfeits the safety of never returning) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes tighten from neighborly rumor to lived tremor; one key middle beat (humming at window) directly narrows options. Cost is felt—Elara’s isolation publicly confirmed—but the external threat never fully materializes, capping ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.9)
    Reverse migration tightens each beat: first lure of memory, then foreclosed alternative paths by midnight. Stakes feel visceral but linger slightly abstract until the final chorus; traded-off time for lyrical charge. One meaningful escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting fragile psychological safety—faces a concrete test when the ledger threatens exposure. Escalation is single but sufficient: discovery of names tightens the noose. Cost is conceptual (risk of destabilizing the peace Mara sells) and acknowledged on page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens when the trunk reveals the captain’s guilt. One meaningful deepening occurs: Elias shifts from observer to active restorer. Cost is conceptual (accepting shared burden) but not yet viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—use the chip to confront buried choices—is signaled early and tightened when the doorway appears. One meaningful turn: stepping through reconfigures memory into agency. Cost is implied but not viscerally staged; pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single dominant stake—“unravel the dreams”—is announced early; the climb’s difficulty supplies escalating pressure under a situational lens: coherent but externalized voice in grotto crystallizes renunciation with no on-page physical cost, keeping the tightening more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save the nexus’s failing light—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when Elara realizes she must stop forcing resonance and let the shell guide; this narrows options from trial-and-error to singular trust. Cost: risk of fourth explosion is palpable. Agency drives the turn; luck only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: reconcile living self with dead past selves. Pressure tightens once—grave forces confrontation, scroll demands ritual, blank page demands new inscription. Cost is conceptual (shedding old weight) rather than tangible. Escalation is steady but leans on symbolic beats rather than irreversible losses.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—unveiling an ordinary miracle through the screw—signals early. Pressure deepens as Lira deciphers the engraving and links it to Eleanor, narrowing interpretive options. Cost is conceptual (Lira’s irreversible anosmia, Mrs. Voss’s guilt) but not viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming scars into stories—is signaled early and tightened through each crystallizing beat; the final portal and glowing scars visibly foreclose the old identity. Escalation is one deepening wave rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for the length. Cost is legible in the irreversible shift of scars to runes.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to expiate guilt via musical apology—is signaled early and tightened by the literal countdown of chainsaws. The single decisive intensification (drop, glow, voice) forces the choice to finish the song. Cost is felt in the empty bottle and resumed cutting, though the sister’s absence remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—unravel illusions—is announced early and faces a final narrowing, but escalating pressure occurs in summary rather than visible beat; agency lies more in realization than confrontation, so cost feels vicarious, not paid on page.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled early and tightens through the counting ritual. The pressure deepens when the fjord ticks back, but escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; Lorn’s agency remains largely receptive. The cost is conceptual, not a foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can Kael revolutionize the barriers without destroying the farm?—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the column’s fear-lattice forces the surrender choice. Cost is the relinquishing of rigid control, dramatized in the spore-rain payoff. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Clara will surrender to chaos or widen perspectives—tightens once when she chooses left at the fork, foreclosing the casino path. Cost is visible: tears mix with rain as she accepts the mirror of contradictions. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—turning wrong-number loneliness into connection—tightens with each call, but pressure is external to Mara; she never faces a trade-off or personal loss. Escalation is accumulative rather than causal, satisfying the lens yet lacking a visible price she must pay.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve the covenant through small acts—is signaled early and tightened by the thinning magic. Pressure deepens as Elara confronts the photo’s joy against inevitable fade, but the escalation is more reflective than causal; no live option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“cure for loneliness”—is signaled early and tightened when the conductor redefines it as language; Elias’s agency drives the offering of the rock. Cost is visible in the emptied hand and eased chest, though the ghost’s dismissal could carry sharper consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure ratchets from curiosity to tangible risk—river’s current warning, silt under fingernails, stillpoint burial—without bloated reversals. One meaningful deepening: river commands “Dig,” foreclosing a speculative path.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—undo the blight—tightens when Elias learns he must relinquish control. One decisive turn: from “I need to fix” to “I will listen.” Cost is explicit: the girl’s fate remains contingent, his certainty surrendered. Escalation driven by anomaly’s reaction to his presence, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—break the town’s amnesiac silence—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the fisherman pleads, “Play that again,” foreclosing Kael’s anonymity. Escalation is accumulative: each signed phrase thickens the texture until the collective silence becomes an instrument. Cost is the dawn solitude that follows the gift.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rescue living knowledge via forbidden art—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens with each room’s new “vandalism.” The meaningful turn occurs when the tear’s ink forces the canvas to heal into the grandmother’s face, foreclosing Mara’s anonymity. Cost is visible: the archive now knows her lineage. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural—each added symbol increases density until the final reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—prove the whisper theory—is signaled early and tightened when Elias chooses silence over rescue shouts, paying the social cost of withheld aid. Pressure escalates because the storm and shifting containers narrow tactical options; coincidence (Libra symbol) complicates rather than resolves. One tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (“teach darkness the value of stars”) remains poetic and abstract rather than tested; pressure plateaus rather than tightens. Tension derives from description layers, but no on-page fork or felt price is enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Lila’s need to connect with her absent father—tightens through each game; the seventh loss crystallizes her shift. Cost is emotional, visible in her softened unspoken words. No external reversals, but internal deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“leaving becomes impossible to resist”—is signaled early and tightened when the island literally fractures. The cost is the obliteration of home; agency is the deliberate release of the scrimshaw. One escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory without visible grief—tightens via each carving stroke; the mandate’s threat supplies coherent pressure. One meaningful deepening: the spoon’s completion reweights “emptiness and fullness,” foreclosing open sorrow. Cost is visible in the ash-stained fingertips and the promise of endless repetition. No reversals required; escalation is accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—dissolving boundaries—escalates through intensifying sensory pressure and the lake’s slow parting. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ice yields under her step, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible but generalized; a sharper forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can Elias find beauty without color?—is signaled early and tightened when the mural erupts. Escalation is driven by his agency: he presses the reed tongue, mixes cobalt dust, confronts Marla. Cost is visible: he relinquishes the reed tongue and accepts a flawed world. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—discovering the texture of connection—is signaled early and tightened when the cave’s hum forces Lira to decide whether to risk the pilgrimage. One meaningful deepening: realizing the mountain is already “singing” reframes the quest from invention to listening. Cost is visible in her hesitation and the lab’s humbled silence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can cultural patterns be mapped from ruin?—tightens once when Elara turns Mara from despair to apprenticeship, foreclosing passive surrender. Cost is the dawn’s exposure and the implicit labor ahead. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via pattern density, not causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to cling to sanctioned narratives or risk corruption by the archive—tightens once when Lirael chooses to absorb the pagoda’s light despite Kael’s warning; the cost is the loss of innocence and sanctioned safety. Escalation is textural, not causal, but pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—is signaled early and tightened when Lirael must choose the word; the cost is conceptual (hope’s fragility) rather than visceral, but agency is clear and escalation coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether compassion is sustainable after betrayal—is signaled early and tightened through the escalating precision of the reconstruction. Each scale laid is a micro-choice that forecloses the option of remaining naively soft. The cost is the acceptance that softness must now include strategic shedding. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—read the scar’s story without drowning in grief—is signaled early and tightened by each portal. Agency: Mara chooses to descend, to touch, to keep watching despite pain. One deepening beat—mother’s “stories are written in scars”—reweights the stake. Cost is visceral: scar burns, tears fall, hourglass shatters.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Unused love stake is visible early and tightened through each beat (letter risk, spliced tear). Price paid is visible film damage and exposure of Elise’s silent grief; stakes escalate under coherent accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—tightens when the stardust ingestion forces an irreversible flood of visions. One meaningful turn: the shift from external search to internal absorption narrows options and exacts the cost of sleepless pursuit. Pressure escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens via density of memory and light.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“cultivate sparks before they fade”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Kael must choose to twist the clock hands, trading his dreamlessness for the archive’s survival. Cost is visible on-page as the dune erupts and the coat of light is assumed.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover the wild frontier of her mind”—is signaled early and escalates through intensifying species hums. The decisive tightening comes when she hears the three-species chord and chooses release, forfeiting the father-gear. Cost is present, though less visceral than emotional. Middle stretch lacks a mid-scene obstacle that could have sharpened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—locating unused courage—remains abstract; the travelers met are helped, but the protagonists’ own courage is never tested or forfeited. Escalation is textural: each stamped ticket thickens the pattern rather than narrows options. A visible price (endless vigil) is implied at the end, but it is not dramatized on-page during the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—cost of safety through enforced silence—tightens when Lady Veyra’s scream ruptures the lullaby. Escalation is single but decisive: Elric’s choice to speak narrows options irreversibly. Cost is audible in the hush that follows the piano’s note; agency is his alone.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore truth against usurped legacy—signalled early and tightened only once but meaningfully through the convergence trigger. Agency remains intact: each beat (deciphering, climbing, pressing, hurling) narrows options toward the final sundering. Cost on the page: courtiers’ “faces slack with adoration” becomes visible loss of certainty. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative drive; coincidence is decorative (alignment) rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“why do paths disappear?”—is signaled early and tightens when plankton spell coordinates, forcing the choice to sail. Cost is implied (abandoning the station) but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping the score just below the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“the rebellion is dead / not dead”—tightens once when the hum peaks and voices rise. Agency is collective ignition rather than individual sacrifice; cost is implied in the thunderous roar but not individually felt, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—evolve tradition or repeat control—tightens when the embryo’s open futures are revealed. One decisive turn: she chooses planting over possession, narrowing options with visible cost (blistered hands, possible crew backlash). Pressure coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: can Lila freeze a moment of peace without erasing Elias? Escalation is accretive: each sensory marker layers pressure until the gust forces a test; she either dissociates or anchors. The tightening beat is the conscious re-inscription of the gust as “just wind,” costing her the last illusion that grief can be outrun. Agency is renunciation: she forecloses the path of perpetual flight.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will Elias reassemble meaning or be crushed by fragmentary despair—tightens as walls press and threads accumulate. The redesign act is the decisive turn that forecloses pure painterly realism; cost is the shredded Hanged Man and the irreversible ink. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—recover temporal truth and her brother—introduced early; pressure tightens from drone discovery to Tower gate. One clear pivot: hologram forces the choice to enter. Cost on page: defying elders, risking Tower entrapment. Escalation coheres under causal lens without gratuitous turns.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned history—is signaled early and tightens once: awakening Kael forecloses her safe archivist path. The cost is named but not yet felt on the body, so pressure peaks conceptually rather than viscerally. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transform relics of violence into living continuity—tightens via escalating pattern (sand into soil, knife into planter). Pressure is accumulative rather than causal; visible cost (calloused hands, reclaimed ballast buried) earns the stance crystallization. No live reversal, but the deepening succession of charged gestures suffices for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—stabilize the garden by catching the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s silence must voice a trade-off. Escalation is one decisive density spike rather than multi-turn causality, but cost is palpable: she dissolves, sky orbits freeze. One 0.2 cap for mild abstraction in “patterns can’t hold you.”

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single dominant stake—legacy vs disclosure—escalates once when the factory memo collapses innocence. Pressure heightens via each contradictory file; cost is legible in family disintegration. Could use one physical prop to ratchet tension mid-arc.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—silence the firmware’s guilt-driven dissonance—is signaled early and tightened when Lira must enter the memory maze. Agency is clear: she chooses to read the letters, rewriting code at personal emotional cost. One escalation beat suffices; no external antagonist needed. Cost is felt but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (decipher or preserve fragile hush) is announced early; pressure tightens via the tile’s urging (“Interject”) and her chalked patterns that unlock a system-wide change. Escalation rises through legitimate agency—drawing in sand, aligning tiles—not luck. The price is loss of passive sanctuary; option tally is rewired by the wall inscription’s irrevocable permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to transform ruin into mercy—tightens once when Elias presses the tessera into the gap, foreclosing nostalgic paralysis. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the acceptance that scars remain visible. No escalation beyond this single turn, but it suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—mending the fractured timeline—is signaled early and tightened when the Wheel reverses. Escalation is accretive: each echo thickens the tapestry, foreclosing collapse. Cost is visible: Elias’s fade and the coin’s blank face. Agency is mostly Elias’s humming/dancing; the flapper’s hand is more symbol than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake framed: “find the pathways already inside them” without pills. Static-shock consequence becomes irreversible somatic markers that incrementally tighten options while deepening stakes: each map glows with more coherence, refusal of refund offer narrows escape. Tension escalates toward felt price of committing to geode-guided method.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decipher the fossil’s language to give voice to the unknown—is signaled early and tightened when the leaf begins to float, forcing a choice: record or merge. The spore absorption is the decisive escalation that forecloses passive observation. Cost is present (the fossil crumbles, her role irrevocably shifts), but the price feels conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—unlock the jar’s wisdom to reshape prophecy—tightens once: the chorus resolves into a directive that forecloses passive reception and demands active planting. The cost is the irreversible release of the echo, but the escalation is more textural than visceral; the price is felt conceptually rather than through immediate loss.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaim courage via vouchsafe—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the creak on the railing forces a reflexive spin, embodying paranoia; the subsequent decision to finish transcribing narrows her path. Cost is the irreversible loss of the inked codes to rain.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—“palimpsest promise” distilled into essence—stays conceptual; pressure rises atmospherically but never narrows options or exacts a visible price. The ferry’s arrival is situational, not a turn driven by Thaddeus’s agency. Escalation is tonal, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—why the oasis resists decay—tightens when the sunflowers’ impossible survival forces Mara to act. One decisive deepening: the vision reveals her own past planting, turning curiosity into custodianship. Cost is the abandonment of safe stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: restore Mara’s capacity to receive light without forcing premature cheer. Escalation is low-voltage yet cumulative: tapping cadence → open window → accepting tool. Cost registered in Elias’s vulnerable leave-taking. Enough for this length; not a dramatic pry.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—proving survival without the ancestral chorus—tightens when the sundial’s visions threaten to reabsorb her. One clear escalation: the hum crescendos, pages fly, and she stakes her claim aloud. The cost is the solitude she accepts, but it could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—fear of disconnection—is signaled early and tightened when Lila writes her secret and watches it vanish. The cost is conceptual (loss of anonymity) rather than visceral, but it forecloses her prior tactic of hiding truths for others.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—save funding/world from cosmic manipulation—is clear; the community schism is the visible lever that tightens stakes. The middle pressure beat forces her precision tactic under on-page time crunch (“board wants to pull funding”). The final truce/surrender does close an option—“game isn’t over” crystallizes persistent cost, not a reset. Escalation under causal lens satisfies.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the key or remain trapped—is signaled early and tightens once the corridor rebels; the price (claustrophobia, bodily risk) is felt, but the spatial mutiny itself resolves more by magical fiat than by Elias’s further agency.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—revive empathy to reopen Lila’s case—is signaled early and tightened once when the handprint and locket force the detectives to act. Pressure grows under causal lens: each discovery forecloses the “cold case” label. Cost is visible in Clara’s throat-tightening recognition and Voss’s decision to reopen. No escalation beyond one meaningful turn, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reversing ancestral exile—tightens when the jet stream accelerates evacuation pressure. One clear escalation: discovery of the codex forces Clara to choose roof ritual over safety. Cost is implied (evacuation risk) but not yet viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“sculpt possibility from the ashes of never”—is signaled early and tightened once when the flake’s pattern locks into coordinates. The cost is conceptual (loss of prior reality) rather than tangible; escalation is single-note but coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—can Elias break the cycle of greed without violence—is signaled early. Tightening occurs off-stage via Marcus’s unseen restlessness; the only on-page escalation is Elias placing bills, which feels low-impact. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—decode or lose the temple’s shifting verses—tightens when Veyra warns of erasure. The prism’s hologram forces Lirael’s surrender, narrowing options from chronicler to bearer of others’ grief; cost is the lullaby scar.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Magical-failure wound tightens stakes; facing frozen confession reconfigures self-image—this deepening narrows options and demands visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—mend the covenant—signals early and tightens once when the golden-eyed self declares “accept the pain.” Agency crystallizes in the final beat: she heeds scars, world splits. Cost is felt (scars vanish, twin moons), though the price feels cosmic rather than personal. One meaningful deepening is sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—repair soul or remain broken—is signaled early and tightened once: the sewing scene forces a trade-off between clinging to certainty and accepting doubt. Cost is visceral (needle through bone, bitter fruit). Escalation is single but sufficient; no reversals needed. Coincidence absent; every turn flows from Lirael’s consent.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find a reason to matter after public failure”—tightens when the cloth’s uselessness threatens his last factual refuge; the phone call forces the trade-off between anonymity and story-keeping. Cost is visible: he abandons the illusion of objective value, embracing unpaid cultural salvage.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reestablishing connection after the spirit’s departure—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when the seed splits and the arbor responds, but the escalation is more atmospheric than causal; the cost is implied rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“shed skin without losing wonder”—is signalled early; pressure escalates through one meaningful turn (entering the creel) where the micro-cost (loss of self) is on page; agency tightens the narrative loop.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes: dissolution of psychic bunkers vs. isolation. Tightening occurs single-shot: placing pearl fuses latent confessions into shared network—narrowing option from cataloguing to bridge-building. On-page emotional toll diffuse for Elias, legible for collective. Agency clear, no coincidences, cost borne by light / pearl, not Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—signaled early; pressure tightens when graffiti forces Mara to translate external maps into internal ones. The accordion chord and heart-map constitute one meaningful deepening that forecloses medicated detachment. Cost is felt: raw exposure without chemical buffer. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (new chalk) complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    The single stake—to reach the unspoken book—escalates cleanly along the cipher, but tension never risks irrevocable loss; Lira’s progress is uninterrupted except by puzzle. No option is foreclosed; glow simply answers, muting felt urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—dream of usurpation versus empire—is signaled early and tightens into final abandonment; the violet violin rupture is the decisive deepening under Accumulative lens. No coincidences solve; choice costs her future path. Agency is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save Elion’s echo—signals early and tightens when the pool begins to fracture. One meaningful deepening: realization that the threshold is a lens amplifies her options but raises cost. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves. Price is visible in her exhaustion and the grotto’s near-loss.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—can trust be reborn?—tightens when the hairpin reappears. One meaningful turn: accepting the returned pin narrows the option of permanent estrangement. Agency is Lirael’s deliberate re-pinning with visible emotional cost. Coincidence (merchant’s guilt) complicates but does not resolve; forgiveness remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Mira’s need to parse guilt versus ghost—is signaled early; escalation occurs through the cloak’s sensory filter and the progressive unhooking of chimes, each narrowing options with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—teaching vanishing through withheld revelation—escalates via Lira’s growing desperation and Elara’s refusal to explain; the spiral pattern marks the single decisive intensification that narrows options to self-discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: mastering “navigation without moving.” Escalation is textural: figure-eight birds tighten the pattern, arrowhead’s pulse reweights the paradox. Cost is legible—he abandons the tower—but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“find the sacred in the simple”—is signaled early and tightened when Kael trades the exotic garden for his mother’s roses. The tightening is driven by his agency and carries visible cost (loss of wonder), meeting the 8.8+ threshold for felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—uncover the color of sound—tightens once when the library’s phrase reframes memory as audible hue. Escalation is accretive: each lantern, book, and key touch deepens the pattern until the final hum forecloses hiding. Cost is the relinquished key and the lifelong silence broken.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode the backwards prophecy to avert existential null—is signaled early and tightened when the spiral vision forecloses skepticism; cost is felt in the shedding of doubt, though the price could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—naming the nameless—is signaled early and tightened when the monsters’ eyes glow. Agency is Elias’s decision to speak the phrase despite warnings; the cost is the irreversible absorption of the monsters into the page and the lingering ache. One meaningful escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure escalates via precise drip calibration; the single tightening narrows options and yields a visible, felt consequence—aligned with the Causal lens—though no secondary reversal is attempted.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—town’s memory versus dam’s failure—tightens once when Mara chooses shared guardianship over solitary expunging. Pressure is coherent but the external dam threat remains more atmospheric than tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—harmonize logic/intuition—escalates via starling pattern recognition that forces the painful flame test. One clear tightening: the spiral dive foreshadows the equation. Cost is visible (burn) and alters tomorrow’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“arbor would unravel, taking the clouds and city”—is signaled early and tested by each node failure. Escalation is one tightening: disrupted fractals → spiral realignment. Agency is Kael’s tactile revision; cost is exhaustion and lifelong guardianship. No coincidence resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—custody of singular existence—signaled early. Escalation is causal: each opposed surge tightens the field until only merger or annihilation remains. Cost is visible in the clone’s scream and Kael’s raw heart. One meaningful turn satisfies scope.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—decipher the seed or lose his sanctuary’s ethos—tightens once when the plant burrows and yields the key. Cost is conceptual (his paradigm shifts) but not viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—is signaled early and escalates through physical exhaustion. One decisive tightening: Marlowe keeps blasting until arms are lead and voice is gone, foreclosing retreat. Cost is visceral; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—guard oath vs dimensional homesickness—tightens when pendant’s symbols mirror childhood walls. One meaningful turn: tossing pendant forecloses cultist alliance and opens library door. Cost is legible: cultist’s scream and her irrevocable step onto moss path.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is announced in line four: interrupt the destiny order Veyra enforced. Escalation is propelled by each painful iteration of silver re-forging under successive approximation; the tightening culminates in flesh-to-ivory contact with visible price (scarred palms). Agency is present in every beat; luck never mediates resolution. One minor abstract lift: “stifling destiny” is slightly high-level, reducing 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled early and tightened by each stripped wire. One clear escalation: the hush shifts from absence to potential, forcing Kael to risk the burn. Cost is visible but not yet viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—merge timelines or abandon passengers—signaled early via Lira’s warning. Escalation tightens once: static resolves into coherent plea, forcing Kael’s irrevocable broadcast. Cost is the ferry’s dissolution and his own unhousing. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early and tightened once when the thread erupts, forcing Clara to renegotiate her stance; cost is visible in her unsettling calm.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lirael’s need to steady herself while guiding others—escalates through the students’ question about shifting alien lights, forcing her to articulate adaptive principles. The tightening is intellectual rather than visceral; the cost is present but diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“assure the vulnerable voice”—is signaled early and tightened when the pulse synchronizes; pressure escalates through Lila’s agency, yet the felt cost remains gentle, keeping it just below the 8.2 gate for high-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prove brother existed via illuminant gold—signaled early. Escalation is coherent: tide clock narrows time, each step deeper increases physical and psychological cost. Final hologram blip is earned by prior causal chain, not coincidence, and forecloses further search.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: reconcile a living body with official death—pressure tightens via AI’s ultimatum and pulse-counting proof. One meaningful deepening—the ink-trace defragmentation—reconfigures Elias’s relationship to the error. Cost is soft: acceptance replaces removal; emotional bruise rather than material sacrifice felt. Agency remains internal; no tangible resource foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translate texture into sound—tightens when the diamond’s song risks drowning her. One decisive intensification: birds freeze, runes ignite, echoes roar back. Cost is searing flesh and permanent silence. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—understanding the cryptid’s effect on the missing—tightens when Elara must choose to let the static in. The metamorphosis beat narrows her options irreversibly; cost is felt in her new layered voice and the spiral etched on the arrowhead.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and tightened through escalating sensory insurgency. The statues’ cracking knees and flickering cores provide visible, escalating cost under the Accumulative lens. One decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—whether broken promises can still resonate—is signaled early and deepened by the storm-question embodied in the bottle. Escalation proceeds via accretion: the hush thickens, the bottle leaves, the sky splits, silence flips to faint life. One meaningful tightening occurs when the soldiers actually lower weapons, demonstrating foreclosed hostility. Cost is visible (guns down, machines alive) but lightly dramatized at the checkpoint itself.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“interpret silence as possibility”—is signaled early and tested when Elio chooses song over secrecy. Escalation is one deepening: the courtyard’s response reconfigures the value of silence itself. Cost is conceptual (the fragment’s glow fades), but the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to reawaken dormant stories”—is signaled early and deepens when the library breathes. One meaningful tightening occurs at midnight when the floor ripples, narrowing Eleanor’s options to cross or retreat; the cost is the irrevocable shift in the library’s atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—recover the runaway dream—is signaled early; pressure tightens when pigment rebels, forcing a single decisive turn from pursuit to acceptance. Cost is visible in the emptied palette and the smile that concedes the dream was never external.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate idea imprisoned by fear—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: unlocking the hair irrevocably alters reality and forecloses return to prior world—the cosmos rewrites itself. Cost is visible: spatial dislocation & weight of secrets on protagonist’s shoulders. Pressure remains coherent, causal, and scales appropriately to 600-800 word scope; no redundant loops or deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is signaled early and tightens through Elias’s mapping of broken constellations. One clear escalation: finding the locket beneath the mushroom redefines the greenhouse from site to mirror. Cost is conceptual (lost decades) rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will exile reverse?—tightens when the woman’s plea forces Lirael to trade knowledge for action. One clear beat: the backward-walk instruction narrows options and carries implicit cost (exposure, emotional reckoning).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—tightens once when the orchard’s graying becomes irreversible without the seed. Escalation is causal: each failed remedy raises the cost of the final ritual. Agency is hers alone; no coincidence resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—free the restless spirits—signaled early. Escalation is Accumulative: each knot loosened intensifies the hush until the final burst. Agency is present but soft; Mara’s fear is voiced yet never truly tests her resolve on the page. Cost is conceptual rather than a forfeited live option, keeping it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—interpret silence with empathy—is signaled early via the journal’s “Reopen the silence.” Escalation is textural: each film reel adds density until the widening crack forces Elias to trade control for listening. Cost is visible—the stones grind apart, holy water spent, and the staircase into darkness forecloses retreat. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—deciphering persistence versus dissolution—tightens when the hum matches the globe. Pressure grows texturally, not causally; the cost is intellectual awe rather than a forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“articulate unspoken needs”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as storm and charcoal dwindle, forcing the last bluebell offering. Cost is felt but diffuse, not viscerally priced.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove clouds retain memory—signaled early; pressure escalates via catalogued cloud emotions that tighten until dawn forces a stance crystallization. Agency rests in Lila’s decision to drift onward; cost is the forfeiture of scientific vindication. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (tower vanishing) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“final portrait of knowledge” before dawn—tightens when discovery of the journal reframes the task from recording decay to preserving legacy. The wrecking ball supplies coherent external pressure; Lira’s agency is the choice to paint the sky-pattern instead of decay. Cost is visible: the tree will fall, the portrait may burn, yet escalation stays singular and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—“chart the next great discovery”—is signaled early and tightened when the portal appears. Escalation is driven by Lira’s deciphering and leap; cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly blunting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes—“mend time before it splinters”—are signaled early and tightened once when the wrong-coat reflection forces a micro-choice. Cost is present (risk of wrong reflection, cold sapping stamina) but not sharply felt at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—save the arches to preserve the nebula—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the settlers must act before twilight. The cost is collective labor rather than personal loss; the price feels shared, diffused, and thus less acute on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“ensure the world’s end would be gentle”—is signaled early and tightened through Mara’s escalating choice to sing despite personal doubt. The pane’s fractal collapse and puppet’s shattering are visible prices that foreclose retreat. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than combat, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—guide travelers or wither—clear from second paragraph. Tightens as birds dive and frost clock ticks; stakes concretize when Kael risks bone-twisting transformation to save woman. The cost paid (locked roots, frost forming) alters next cycle. Agency remains Kael’s; no external rescuer. One meaningful escalation chain under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—repairing the ruptured sister bond—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the text invitation forces a yes/no that Elara pays with emotional exposure. The foam insight re-weights the stake conceptually but does not escalate external risk; the cost is relational, not situational, keeping tension modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding versus releasing unshaped narrative potential—is signaled early and tightens when the stranger requests “a story that hasn’t happened yet,” forcing Elara to risk unleashing uncontained absence. One meaningful deepening occurs as the note drifts back, reweighting her responsibility. Cost is conceptual (loss of control, unknown consequences) but not viscerally felt on the page, capping escalation short of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can remorse be tempered without being transferred wholesale?—is signaled early and tightened when the founder’s memory surges. Nessar’s act of subsuming narrows future options: he must now bear what he sought to erase. The price (physical numbness, shared pallor among guards) is visible, though the escalation is single-arc rather than multi-turn. Still, the deepening feels earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing the weight to heal communal silence—is signaled early and tightens through each linguistic incantation. The meaningful deepening occurs when the elevator’s groan modulates into harmony, but the cost is collective rather than personal, blunting the protagonist’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rewiring reality to salvage abandoned dreams—tightens through escalating risk of memory bleed. One decisive deepening when Kael’s own failures flood the interface; cost is felt in the trembling hands and racing heart.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes tighten when the 57-minute clock forces Lira’s dash for the threshold; causal pressure dips during middle beats but closes decisively on cost to forestalling.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“create music in a silent world”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened through each strum until the porcelain’s destruction forecloses the option of further human-made sound. Escalation is accumulative: each day’s practice deepens the grove’s acoustic architecture. The final cost is the insulator itself and the irreversible shift to teaching the grove to sing without her. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency remains Elara’s.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the forgotten covenant—tightens once when the stone’s dent translates into star-map chessboard, forcing the key choice. Cost is felt in exile and the irreversible planting. Agency is Alaric’s throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decode silence via diary—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: failed picks → resonance gambit → click. The tightening forecloses the option of brute force and exacts the cost of empathic burden. Agency remains with Lirael; coincidence (fireworks boom) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—harmonize restless energy via bloom—is signaled early and tightens through scent-shifts and elder skepticism. One clear deepening: Lira’s pivot from forcing growth to embracing stillness narrows tactics and carries the felt cost of public doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover the planet’s resilience—tightens when the arrow tip locks and gravity flips forever. One decisive intensification suffices, but the price (eternal guardianship) is stated more than dramatized, muting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—survive the port’s emergent wind-machine—escalates via sensor data and bodily threat. One decisive tightening: 45 mph gust forces climb. Cost is visible (redesign mandate) but less visceral than atmospheric dread.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and tested by the cavern’s oppressive silence. Escalation is accumulative: each spectral hue tightens the texture until silence becomes unsustainable. Agency rests in Lira’s sustained song; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible: her breath fogs, cheeks flush, resin scent hints at bodily tax. One deepening beat—stalactites drip into arches—narrows options to irreversible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—master the flute’s purpose or remain trapped by failure—is signaled early and tightened when the mentor demands “unmake.” The discordant playing that snaps the reeds is a decisive, costly turn that narrows options and forces surrender. Pressure escalates under causal agency; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can emotion be quantified?—tightens when the fragment turns the experiment back on Elias. One meaningful escalation: the empathy merge forces a stance crystallization. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve. The price—loss of analytical armor—is felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Kail will trust the relic’s purpose—tightens when the pendant’s hum spikes at the woman’s appearance; planting the seed is a decisive act that forecloses retreat and visibly costs his former skepticism, though the escalation is compressed into one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove emotional absorption—is signaled early and tightened when visions intensify. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the arbor only mirrors collapses the goal and reframes the cost. Agency remains with Mara; coincidence complicates (shattered glass) but does not resolve. The price is the loss of her explanatory framework, legible in her bitter laugh and the tucked-away prism.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore sound to the world—signaled early. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: each puzzle-fit thins silence, culminating in the twin-bead fusion. Final tightening forces the trade-off: keep bead (silence) or release it (song). Cost is visible in the floating bead and stilled loom. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—planet’s vitality—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: spectral Lira forces endurance test that forecloses retreat. Cost is visceral (blood, pain). No coincidence resolves; Jorin’s agency drives orb absorption. Escalation is single but sufficient for 800-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. safety—signaled in mother’s hologram and sharpened by shard’s compulsion. Escalation: each beat narrows Kael’s agency until renunciation is the only path left. Cost is visible: loss of shard and of reunion. One intensifier—“roar of colliding realities”—feels abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to keep the feeling of safety alive once the lamp dies—is signaled early and escalates through each nightly exchange. Agency is expressed in Elias’s decision to keep stacking even after the lamp is declared irreparable; this renunciation of mechanical rescue carries visible cost. One meaningful tightening: the stones must be restacked every dusk, a recursive duty that forecloses rest. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—“shape the new dawn with ancient shadows”—is clear; pressure tightens as the Herald twists the wick and shadows thicken to reveal unavoidable darkness. One meaningful deepening occurs when oily silhouette complicates prophetic gold. Agency is active through lantern manipulation and final stance; a visible price is abstract (fear, implication), satisfying at length but missing visceral loss for higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single, coherently escalating stake magnetizing stories narrows around Lin’s irrevocable stance crystallization; blue glow tightens options at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transform sorrow into usable knowledge—tightens when the sextant’s map reveals dream-geometries, forcing Elias to choose passage through the root-lined wall. Pressure escalates via pattern density rather than external threat; the cost is conceptual (loss of prior certainty) but only lightly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure is single-thread yet acute: the dying realm’s need versus Lira’s finite voice. Escalation accrues through growing light and spreading melody until “the realm learned to swaddle itself” marks intensification, not resolution. One price (hoarseness, exhaustion) is visible; a sharper trade-off would punch 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling grief through hidden observation—tightens once: the blank book forces Eleanor to confront what she brings. Pressure is coherent but mild; the society never truly obstructs her. The final cost is emotional insight rather than a forfeited option.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming wonder from creeping normality—is signaled early and tightened when Elias chooses to plant rather than consume the impossible bread. The escalation is one deepening beat, not a reversal, but it narrows his path from observer to participant. Cost is conceptual (loss of nostalgic artifact) rather than visceral, slightly softening the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—stop the trust-breaking device—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation tightens once: from wide market search to single tower sprint against a live midnight deadline. Smash forecloses negotiation; cost is the father’s exposed betrayal and her own exile from the market’s economy of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—why weather clings to people/places—is signaled early and tightens when the compass points to the bluff itself; the election-night release deepens pressure. Cost is felt in the copper-blood taste, though the protagonist’s agency in the final moment is slightly underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—uncork creativity—tightens when the lock’s click forecloses the safe, monochrome life. One meaningful deepening: the shadow-door’s darkness is accepted rather than solved. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover mother’s last words—is signaled early and tightens when the orb proves empty; Elara’s agency reframes loss into seed-planting, foreclosing literal retrieval. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the acceptance of echo. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—redeeming wonder from a noisy world—tightens through the shrinking ice and the growing audience hush. Escalation is Accumulative: each droplet and visitor adds pressure until the final chord forecloses the option of speech. Cost is legible in the vanished fragment. Agency is largely contemplative, but the tuning and building choices drive every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: contain chaos or be overrun by resurfacing fears. Escalates via box-fray → plasma burn → orb uptake; miniaturize act visibly forecloses old identity. Cost paid: fusion of android with human irrationality. Tension tightens rather than turns a plot; qualifies under accumulative-textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—unlock the mailbox’s secret—tightens once when Clara deduces the combination from the locket dates. The pressure is intellectual rather than visceral; the cost is the soldier’s death, felt at a remove. Agency is cerebral, but the narrowing of options is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single dominant stake: liberate antidote. Escalation follows escalating dance decryption and drone threat; tightening felt as heartbeat count under water pressure. Closure remains Charged Poise, not rescue beat, so cost reweighted in image rather than physical reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—is signaled early and tightened when the rose floods Elias with foreign memories. The deepening is driven by his agency (touching the rose), but the price is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent cosmic storm via silence—is signaled early and tightened once: the wing’s absorption narrows options to succeed or lose the haven. Agency is ritual enactment; cost is the wing’s dissolution. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via density of hush rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: whether to awaken the library’s language. Escalation tightens once: from shared lies to the lie told to the building. Agency is Elias’s decision to speak; cost is the audible voice in the walls. No coincidence resolves; meteor shower is sign, not deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—tightens when the resonance flares force a choice: hoard or release memories. One decisive intensification suffices; the ash roses mark visible price. Agency drives the turn, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to finish the forgery and release it—tightens once: the blood-drop seals the lie, foreclosing retreat. Pressure accumulates through sensory density (drips, light, ache) rather than external antagonists. The cost is visible: a rust-colored stain that breathes, a body that aches, a curse tucked into the sleeve. Stakes remain abstract, preventing the final leap to 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—why some voices echo—tightens once via the hooded figure’s revelation. Pressure deepens but never forces a trade-off; cost remains atmospheric rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—salvage love from wreckage—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as each dream reveals a new facet of the sailor’s lingering love, narrowing Kael’s options to act. Agency is present—he chooses to weave truth into dreams—but the on-page cost (a hum of approval) is more atmospheric than visceral. No external antagonist; internal stakes carry the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent stillpoint collapse—is signaled early and escalates through each beat. The flawed diamond’s sacrifice narrows options and exacts a visible price. One tightening suffices, but the pressure could feel more viscerally urgent in the final chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—harnessing the storm’s language—tightens via escalating transmissions and the prism mechanism; cost is conceptual (fragility embraced) but felt through the hourglass’s gravity-defying swirl.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to redeem lost voices—tightens when the first jar’s lullaby forecloses his own forgetting. Each subsequent jar deepens the cost: personal memory traded for communal song. Agency is clear; coincidence never rescues. The escalation is one sustained intensification rather than multiple reversals, sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: preserve key’s balance before darkness. Tightens once: ghost’s lunge forces Elias to trade bodily stamina for harmonic answer; escalation reads as density increase under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible—“his legs burned.” Luck only externalizes stakes (sunset fade) rather than resolves. Stakes remain personal, not world-ending, scaled to length.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (freeing herself from Cole’s control) is signaled early; a single but decisive escalation occurs when the files reveal “Eliminate” and the vision exposes Cole’s manipulation. The cost is a foreclosed trust path; no reversals needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to endorse the rehabilitation program—tightens when the clockwork heart materializes as tangible proof of inmate contrition. The single meaningful turn is Marcus’s silent decision to carry the heart back; escalation is modest but coherent under a situational lens. A more palpable forfeiture (e.g., risking professional credibility) would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“ring the bell no one hears yet”—is signaled early and tightens when the kaleidoscope shows a crash image, forcing a choice between vision and survival. Each transliteration tweak narrows aerodynamic options until the final dive forecloses retreat; the wreckage is the felt price. No off-stage rescue; the algorithm’s success is paid with the Skein’s destruction. One beat of escalation suffices for 700-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Elara’s fate—escalates as each decoded clue narrows Lira’s options. The tightening is clear: from open search to locked coordinates to imminent capture. Cost is visible in the blaring alarms and Hale’s threat, though the price of escape is still more potential than paid. One meaningful turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—quieting the fear-storm—is signaled early and deepened through each mirror glimpse. One meaningful tightening: the weighted breath before reply forces the empathic synthesis. Cost is conceptual (shared grief absorbed) and visible in the flare that stills the floes.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—how to live with creative and emotional mismatch—is signaled early. Pressure deepens when Lila abandons her easel; the walk becomes the single tightening beat. Agency is shared, diffuse; no irreversible choice is made, only a stance crystallization. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete, so escalation stays lyrical rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve wisdom echo—is signaled early and tightened through ritual escalation. Agency is joint, but Mara’s peripheral awareness drives the decisive anchor. Cost is conceptual (line’s perpetual burden) rather than visceral, slightly muting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—transmuting pain into art—tightens once when Lila realizes the masterpiece may already exist; this reweights her goal with a visible renunciation (no new photograph needed). Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode growth—intensifies as the crystal sharpens the pattern, forcing Elias from passive observation to urgent note-taking. One clear tightening beat: realization that growth is non-linear compels him to “testify.” Cost is the loss of comfortable silence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound—tightens through spatial displacement and material endurance until Elias stands immobile by the tower and accepts aging vibration as sufficient. Cost: renounces precognition; tension not external but experiential. One clear "sound of growing older" climax suffices for 600 w scope.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—mastery over ephemeral time—tightens once when Elias realizes the hand measures escape, not duration. The cost (abandoning earthbound life) is legible but stated more than felt; still, agency drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: deliver a flawless goodbye before Elias dies. Tightening occurs when the vinyl skips and Elias’s voice strengthens, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is visible: Clara’s sobs, Mira’s aching chest, the shard’s transfer. Agency rests in Mira’s steady holding of space; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“find where shadows go”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the Weeping Archer alignment window narrows options. The cost is conceptual (knowledge of backward-time realm) rather than visceral, limiting escalation intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can understand the garden without losing herself—tightens when Elias demands a second tooth. Agency remains hers: placing both teeth realigns the garden and forecloses denial. Cost is felt in the mutual admission of avoidance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—share untouched starlight under fire-ban—drives each beat. Escalation narrows: collect light → weigh cost → release with visible forfeiture, not coincidence. One decisive tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Lila will release her guilt into shared tending—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the offer to graft moss into the pendant forces a visible trade-off. Cost is legible: she relinquishes sole guardianship of the memory. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to end a story without killing it—tightens when Clara must choose between neat closure and living current. The deletion of the last chapter is the visible price. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“the arbor’s fading magic”—is signaled early and visibly reversed through progressive restoration. One meaningful tightening: the vine collapses, demanding communal stewardship. Yet escalation is external (forest wakes, stream sings) more than psychological; the protagonist’s internal tension never sharpens to a pivot with unmistakable cost. Lemons-to-lemonade outcome feels slightly inevitability-tinged.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—sealing starlight to craft living maps—narrows through earned escalation (failed attempts) and charging final constellation pulse. One decisive tightening sufficeth.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore the harvest to store wonder—tightens once when Elias realizes the micro-etchings demand alignment with natural rhythms. Agency is clear: each visit maps a new constraint, culminating in the decisive gear insertion. Cost is felt in Elias’s quiet renunciation as he leaves the keepers to label vials. Pressure could have sharpened further had the wounded season shown visible decay rather than abstract “faint vibrations.”

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—collect burdens without being consumed—tightens when the obsidian resists and Kael’s hands tremble. The final refusal to melt the locket forecloses a path with felt cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: transform grief into tangible form. Pressure tightens once—wood yields, candle shortens, kettle cools—marking elapsed crystallized time. Agency is steady endurance; no external antagonist, yet the blank’s resistance and memory’s weight create sufficient friction. Cost is the irreversible cold kettle and spent flame, felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—negotiating with her ghost—tightens when the camera wheel is offered, then released. The deepening is her decision to rest, which forecloses repair dreams. Cost is visible in her disappearance and the preserved rose. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no reversal, but one decisive renunciation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—prove broken systems can birth hope—is signaled early and tightened when the equation appears. Escalation is a single deepening: discovery of sextant → redirect flows → equation projected. Cost is abstract (future uncertainty) rather than tangible. Agency is hers, yet pressure feels moderate; no irreversible forfeiture shown.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reconciling abandoned wanderlust with clock-bound life—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the bear’s appearance forces a stance crystallization. Agency is mostly receptive (listening, touching), but the final reconfiguration forecloses the old binary of stay/leave. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; a more tangible forfeiture would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unraveling the architecture of lies—is signaled early and tightened when the blueprint reveals a literal machine for narrative control. One meaningful escalation: the sundial’s shadow pivots from celestial guide to ideological compass, foreclosing the simpler treasure hunt. Cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the dawn-light realization.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preservation of ancestral knowledge—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened with every knot decoded. Pressure escalates into the fog-bound encounter where refusal to chase further forecloses the “loom” path with visible conceptual cost: the woman’s departure leaves Elias in Earned Stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“understand the geography of healing”—is clear, and the thread’s hum momentarily narrows her focus. Yet pressure remains ambient; the missing woman poses no concrete obstacle or demand, so escalation is atmospheric rather than option-changing.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reawaken organic beauty—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the egg cracks: the palace itself must choose metal or moss. Agency is high; every adjustment of lens or wire is a micro-choice that escalates risk. Cost is felt (solitude, bodily decay) yet the final price is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it just shy of the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens when Lira must choose between clinging to the coin’s guilt or releasing it to heal Mara’s bird. Agency is clear: her decision to drill, string, and ultimately surrender the coin drives the escalation. The cost is visible when she loosens her grip on the past. One meaningful deepening suffices, but the external conflict (arguing adults) dissipates without altering tactics, keeping the score below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled early and tightened by each breadcrumb; the eighth piece’s absence narrows options. Escalation is accumulative: each insertion brightens the box, raising felt cost. Final release is earned, not coincidental, and forecloses Lira’s skeptical refuge. A crisper material loss (bleeding fingers, time) would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to wield light without destruction—tightens when the ghost reframes fire as forgotten language. One decisive deepening: Lumin’s realization that “light is fire, child. Just… a quieter kind” forces the gear’s relinquishment. Cost is felt in the ancestral scars and the solitude of carrying a gentler flame forward.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transform inherited silence into communally shared grief—tightens through each visitation; micro turn when poem becomes carved stone narrows options from spoken word to permanent mark. Cost (Marlow’s silence transferred into stone) is visible.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—restart the pendulum before the ridge cracks the village—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through each obsidian groan. The single meaningful intensification is the Hush deepening until Lirael’s whispered inscription becomes the only remaining tactic; the cost is the searing reverie that leaves her hands raw and vision clouded.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will predictive modeling defeat perpetual winter—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation tightens through nightly data and derision from Elders; the equinox crack is the earned reversal that narrows options (winter is no longer inevitable). Cost: burnt journals, dulled quill, social scorn endured.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“teach dust to tell stories”—is signaled early and held. Pressure deepens lyrically as fragments accrue, but the tightening is tonal rather than tactical; no option is visibly foreclosed, so the cost remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.1)
    Escalation is accretive: each beat deepens the contradiction between preservation and obliteration; ash smudges, porcelain mask, and silence build toward the unmade portrait. No external pressure—only interior tightening—limits higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: save ancestral navigation from digital forgetting. Escalation driven by Elias’s digging choices: each sediment layer forecloses prior tactics (Mara forces sell-or-keep cutoff). Closure crystallizes stance with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring vanishing arts—is declared, but pressure escalates by accumulation rather than narrowing; each new artist adds texture yet dilutes personal risk for Clara. External stakes (riots, borders) stay off-stage, softening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—redeeming the seed’s traumatic memories into communal hope—escalates through each pruning cut that narrows the plant’s path. The cost is visceral (her gasping, trembling) and the final bud’s future-vision crystallizes the trade-off; coincidence (alignment) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—restore collective wonder to reboot the tower—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: from tallying energy to risking social safety to speak truth. Cost is visible: Clara’s perpetual exposure, the drones’ physical damage. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and internal. One deepening beat when she decides to “weaponize” candor narrows options irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to understand why some houses feel alive”—is signaled early and deepened when the ritual succeeds, narrowing Lira’s future path. Escalation is textural (density of hush), but the felt cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of loss—tightens when the rupture forces Kael to relinquish possession; the cost is the dice’s permanent escape. Escalation is one deepening under the Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. Pressure stays coherent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness persists—tightens when Mr. Voss’s tearful recognition forces Lila to trade solitary proof for collaborative translation. Escalation is accumulative: each kindness fossil (loaf, dandelion) gains weight until the final reconfiguration. Cost is visible: sleeplessness, relinquished brush, altered painting. No coincidence resolves; recognition is earned by prior depiction.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“arts are dying”—is signaled early and tightened when Lila decides the lens will grace the stage. The pressure is coherent: fewer artists, vanished bees, spring thaw as deadline. Cost is felt in the beekeeper’s absence and the children’s untrained voices.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“step beyond fate”—is signaled early and escalates through each failed attempt until the lighthouse awakens. Agency is high; each micro-choice (winding, pouring mercury) narrows options and raises stakes. Cost is legible: the stone’s deeper cold, the island’s shudder. One tightening turn suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“trick fear into revealing its weakness”—is tested in one tightening beat: the paradoxical welcome. Cost is seared skin and the cloak’s irreversible shift from faint glow to steady gold. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—turning chaos into harmony—tightens through each percussive beat; the orchard’s structural groan supplies audible pressure. One clear escalation: the shift from flat plank to lightning-tree gong narrows options and raises stakes. Cost is visible in sweat and splintered wood.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover why watchers move—escalates when the journal reframes them as screaming keepers and the shells as hungry. Each tightening (crack, hum, collapse) narrows Lira’s choices until endurance is the only agency left. Cost is visible: city shakes, people flee, shells devour. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering the buried truth—tightens when the ledger dates expose the decade-long delay. One clear escalation: the manifesto’s smuggling myth collapses, forcing Elara to reframe history. Cost is the moral burden of publishing a truth that may destabilize inherited peace.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—mapping vs unearthing stories—tightens when the hatch demands she choose documentation or communion. One meaningful deepening: the desk proves grandmother’s tales real, foreclosing skepticism. Cost is the irreversible knowledge that absence is presence. Pressure stays coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“trace honest origins”—is signaled early and tightened when the journal exposes collective denial. The spiral-door beat narrows options from cataloguing to bearing witness; cost is felt in the “raw, unvarnished” weight of truth, though the price could be more viscerally staged.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into flight—tightens as each polish risks reopening loss. One meaningful deepening: the shadow’s return forces public confrontation. Cost is the visible tremor and the promise of perpetual folding.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—access unused potential to re-see reality—tightens when circuit-breaker countdown and node instability foreclose retreat. Escalation is causal: each override raises physical and existential cost. Final price is the obliteration of the observatory and the irreversible shift in Elara’s ontology.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode belonging—is signaled early and tightened when the lever choice irreversibly aligns the dome. Cost is conceptual: the answer dissolves into resonance rather than place. Agency is clear; coincidence only guides, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or expose a family erasure—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through each driftwood fragment; the final choice forecloses the lucrative lie trade. Cost is visible: Elias risks client trust and professional identity. No coincidence resolves the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—trust across enemy lines—tightens once when Clara drops the pull, renouncing the safety of symbolic blame. Pressure grows through accumulating sensory detail and mirrored objects rather than causal reversals. The cost is felt in the relinquished talisman and Elias’s quiet retention of his own. No coincidence resolves the exchange; silence suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—stop hiding from regret—is signaled early and tightened at the lighthouse: “I’m done hiding.” One meaningful turn: abandoning the compass forecloses the safety of inherited guidance. Cost is visible in the southward paddle, though the emotional price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—can Mara recover empathy after erasure—is signaled early and tightened by each reflected life-path. The lake forces a single crystallizing stance: accept the weight of past choices. Cost is conceptual (permanent ambiguity) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond or lose self—tightens once via irreversible metamorphosis. Agency drives escalation; cost is visible in feathered flesh. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will Elara release her self-exile to reclaim lost time—tightens when the saucer crack widens and the tree offers ascent. One decisive deepening: the vision of her mother reframes repentance as choice, not place. Cost is the irreversible dissolution of the glade and the fantasy of endless penance.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save ship via open dimension—signals immediately. Pressure tightens as the dimmed locket narrows Lira to confront denied shadow; one meaningful escalation when door resistance yields. Cost is felt in Lira’s fear-laughter and shattered locket. Stays within single pressure point; meets scale.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stake—the obligation to end accidental prophecy tightening—turns when bugs become symbols she must release. Cost is felt when prior “fixes” are re-framed as complicity; volcanic quiet acts as earned stasis. Middle beats lose 0.5 for too gentle escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—igniting the revolution—tightens when the blackout becomes a Council test; the sundial’s solution narrows options to one hidden chamber. Cost is implied (discovery = death) but not yet viscerally paid, capping just below 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore sacred order—tightens through each failed sequence until the Möbius strip forecloses control and forces acceptance. Escalation is causal: each pattern attempted raises the star-dust’s threat until the final stilling. Cost is felt in the blinding flare and the tear-salt sting. No coincidence resolves the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—uncensored truth vs survival—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: reading the cartographer’s poem forces Kael to rarefy his own words and commit to mailing them. Escalation is textural: storm intensifies, timer ticks, stakes compress. Cost is the certain exposure once the envelope leaves the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translation versus victory—tightens once when the stellar map is revealed; cost is the graze and the yielded blade. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no reversals beyond the single deepening required.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Cedar can keep integrating fractured selves—tightens when the new poem forces a stance shift. Pressure accumulates via the tin’s weight and the moon’s ascent; the final reconfiguration forecloses the option of endless rebuilding. Cost is legible in the acceptance of perpetual flux, though external stakes remain muted.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—creative paralysis versus autonomous play—intensifies once when she chooses the unplanned encore over fix-it plans. Escalation is single tightening, not reversal; it reweights the “strategically creative” curse into an un-strategic release. Cost legible: abandons the chance to repair clock or re-enter strategy.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—protecting collective memory from monsoon oblivion—is signaled early and escalates through sensory intensification and the dream-fracture. A single decisive tightening occurs when Lira chooses to confront fear and re-enter the dream, but the on-page cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the color of unspoken apologies”—tightens through escalating risk (compass locking, father’s ghost materializing) with visible cost: Lira must release the lace to him, the price paid at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (professional identity vs. humility) tighten through dust analysis and symposium, but the botanist’s arrival resolves isolation it didn’t create—coincidence undermines Accumulative escalation; cost (career fracture) is legible though not viscerally embodied in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate through Lirael’s agency (reading frost, entering crevice), but the survival backstory’s physical/emotional cost remains abstract; no present-tense demonstration of "hollow creativity" (e.g., a failed glass attempt) weakens the felt price paid for her new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single dominant stake (proving silence’s expressiveness) tightens through Lirael’s agency: heat-mapping joy vs. fear, then the lullaby breakthrough. Cost is legible in the final tradeoff ("ocean took her voice... washed her ashore here"), though fork’s sound moment slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (redefining rest) tighten through Elias' welding persistence, but escalation lacks meaningful cost escalation beyond internal shift; dominant stake coherent yet pressure peak feels low-stakes for length despite agency-driven closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (trust vs anonymity) tightens through Mira's ringing, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost ("Let sanctions break us"). Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens via pattern-break in donation system, altering community tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake ("where is unused love stored?") tightens through Lira’s breathing method narrowing options to follow the light trail; cost is felt in emotional surge at the pool, but internal conflict lacks physical escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as photos disintegrate and visions overwhelm; agency drives escalation through Elara's deliberate fragment placement. Cost is unmistakable in "retrocognitive visions were gone" and the fragment's inert state, reshaping her future choices.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten causally: wall collapse draws scavengers, forcing Lirael to accelerate her plan ("moments left"). Her agency drives every escalation—from key alignment to vial-hurling—and the snapped chains embody a visible cost that forecloses her chained state. No coincidence resolves conflict; scavengers’ greed directly tests her resilience mission.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through agency-driven escalation (vial additions, root severing), with the crucible's "scream of glass shattering" reweighting the dominant stake through visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when the jar demands reciprocity, forcing Elara’s agency (offering the photo). Guard’s dozing slightly eases escalation, but cost legibility (wilted lily) elevates the climax’s emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through the thaw’s progression (ice revealing compartment), but the dominant pressure—abandoning perfection—relies on reflection rather than immediate environmental coercion; cost is felt yet under-embodied in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate causally from note-decoding to confrontation where vulnerability becomes tactical language. Resolution cost feels conceptual rather than visceral due to off-page mob boss arrest, weakening tangible payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (mapping silence) signaled early, but escalation lacks tightening. Fort’s groans and residual tension deepen atmosphere yet don’t narrow options or raise cost meaningfully. No visible price paid (ink vial unused, quill intact) weakens Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via sensory density—holograms, melting ice, temporal collisions—narrows options under accumulative lens, though the scientist's return slightly softens the felt cost of the violin's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (mistrust of silence) tightens via Elias’s agency: decoding the ticket narrows options to either dismissal or engagement. Cost—abandoning log-keeping for doodling—is legible in the final beat’s tangible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation narrows options when Joren adopts Elara’s methods, forcing the maze to "recalibrate around her." Cost is legible in the maze’s responsive hostility easing, driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten via Veyra's agency—recalibration forecloses failure with felt cost (sweat, thrashing creatures). But director's late appearance introduces coincidental pressure, slightly undercutting pure causal escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (proving ghost's existence) tightens when symbols match sheet music, then surges via pipe coincidence. Agency evident in memorizing code despite physical cost; visible price paid in soaked state altering tactics (clutching notebook). Coincidence complicates but doesn't resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Lirael’s agency: discovering the "QUARANTINE" folder deepens knowledge, narrowing options to departure. Dominant stake (truth vs. institutional lie) tightens through her smudging act, with visible cost in her role dissolution. Agency fulfills 9+ quick test but secondary stake (station stability) lacks sufficient interweaving for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elias's agency: skepticism → valve turn → descent → truth confrontation. Cost unmistakable in final image's physical/emotional weight. Dominant stake (truth vs safety) signaled early and narrowed to single trade-off: knowledge vs burden.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (escaping judgment for regenerative silence) tightens through keeper's burrowing agency; cost is unmistakable in "stranger's face" reflection and reality's "faint echo," though the river's backward flow feels slightly convenient rather than earned through prior constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' realization that ignoring stories caused the axis shift. His choice to speak bears visible cost—shoulders trembling as stories rise—driven entirely by his agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (exposing hidden assumptions) is signaled early but escalation remains static—looped questions accumulate without raising cost or narrowing options. "Before possession completes" timeframe lacks causal urgency; pressure grows texturally but not through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through dawn's progression ("before exhaustion hit" live clock), but exhaustion as pressure lacks visceral manifestation beyond metaphor until late payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (self-acceptance) tightens through timeline confrontations, but escalation relies on accumulative reflection rather than causal trade-offs; cost (loss of power) feels earned yet insufficiently visceral at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (defeating numbness) tighten through protagonist agency: the filament of hush’s mechanics force a trade-off (reversed music as "palimpsest of emotion"). Pressure builds via Accumulative density, but the numbness resolution lacks visceral urgency early on. Cost is legible in the chest’s "weight of feeling."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (truth vs safety) tightens when recorder alarms at biohazard. Pressure escalates through Elias's agency—rooftop survey, clinic entry—but woman's clinic reveal relies on coincidence, diluting causality. Cost (endangerment) legible in "perimeter lights flared."

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (understanding scent-triggered grief) tightens via single escalation: uncorking vial risks unraveling, paid with emotional cost in tears. Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, but secondary pressure lacks depth for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Kael's agency in untying knots—each memory release narrows options toward the spiral's revelation. Cost is legible in "weight of unwritten lines," though the timeframe ("after beings arrive") lacks live-clock pressure that would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake ("break silence wall") tightens via violin-bowl resonance; agency-driven deepening reweights grief as potential; cost visible in physical vibration and community's hesitant participation. One intensification suffices for Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (truth/lie balance) tightens when Lira tests *Eclipsed Memories*, but the cost ("subsume joy") remains abstract declaration rather than dramatized consequence. Pressure accumulates texturally without narrowing Elias's options or altering his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten when Clara recognizes Lila in the photo, creating visible cost (her hurried past indifference). Agency drives the forged letter, but the boardinghouse scene relies on coincidence—Eleanor’s departure "weeks ago" lacks causal pressure, diluting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by Lila’s agency—her twist of the pendant narrows options to entering the tunnel—with visceral cost in disorientation ("thickened air"). Stakes tighten via the giant’s stirring snores, reweighting her understanding of echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via protagonist agency: her ritual choices (aligning chips, pouring sap) deepen the dominant stake (ambiguous loss) through accumulating sensory pressure. Cost unmistakable in the physical/emotional shift where "tears mixing with sap" reweights loss as nourishment rather than void.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency as the tape reel’s sense memory escalates from curiosity to lifeline; cost is visceral in her identity shift from "invisible" to "guardian" with no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (control vs. surrender) tightens when Eleanor withdraws her hand, foreclosing intervention. Cost is legible via professional identity shift, but "stifling her work" slightly overstates the conceptual price needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Marin’s agency—her choice to follow rain trails and exchange canvas for brooch narrows options—but the stranger’s coincidental arrival slightly undercuts pressure escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stake (control vs. chaos) tightens meaningfully when pearl contact fractures the song. Agency in Elara’s choice to hold it forecloses "magnifying" purity, but escalation lacks a second pressure point; cost is felt but not actively paid beyond perception.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through Lirael’s agency: each staggered return narrows options (journal discovery → fisherman’s tale → locket revelation), but the exile’s "salt-sting" could deepen the felt cost earlier to heighten pressure beyond procedural success.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (truth vs. habits) tighten through Elias's agency—using the punch redefines options. Cost is legible in his "trembling certainty" as he accepts vulnerability, though the "hour" timeframe remains abstract rather than a live clock altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (skepticism vs wonder) tightens via Aelia's memory of ostracism mirroring Clara's loneliness, but pressure grows passively through received memories rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten causally as the storm weakens the amulets, forcing Kael’s choice between known boredom and terrifying freedom. The mirror-crack revelation of his hollow future self delivers visible cost, crystallizing his agency when Lira’s urgency ("Now") meets his terror of the void.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation via hum’s intensification drives agency, but cost remains conceptual vapor. "Felt cost" requirement unmet—Althea’s smile obscures stakes despite townsfolk’s awe.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully through the storm sequence (container shift forcing skeleton discovery), but the conspiracy motive remains abstract; "why erase Marcus?" lacks concrete on-page escalation beyond whispered clues.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven by Lira’s agency (playing cello) under Accumulative lens, reweighting stakes via density increase. Cost is unmistakable ("ache in her chest"), though the shell’s magic slightly blurs causal ownership in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation driven by Lira’s agency (translating graffiti into map) narrows options to one confrontation; "looming deadline" symbolism tightens stakes, but timeframe urgency lacks visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    One dominant stake (human care vs. drone indifference) tightens through dawn countdown, but drone pressure lacks escalation beyond chime; cost is felt in "summit felt colder," though "didn’t care" slightly dilutes stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency—patching the wing while recalibrating the servo narrows options to tactile precision. Cost is felt in her shift from doubt ("needed more") to quiet competence, though the anchor lift’s dawn deadline lacks visceral time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake—"finding rivers' reasons"—tightens when the map reveals light as source, forcing Clara to abandon geological assumptions. Her agency drives escalation (trekking north, chipping ice) with visceral cost (half-buried in snow, raw voice). Jorn's warnings deepen tension without resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten through accumulating footsteps, but cost lacks on-page visibility during the critical townsfolk transformation. Their instant shift from "gaunt, wary" to joining the rhythm feels unearned by Kael's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (harness vs release ephemeral) tightens through scent-triggered memories, but storm deadline fails as concrete pressure—it's declared but never alters tactics beyond generic time pressure, weakening escalation's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake ("chasing hush") tightens through Elias's agency: rejecting the figure's "outrun the story" with "I'm writing" forecloses escape. Cost is visceral in the reef's "jagged maw" view, reweighting the prelude with unavoidable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Lira's sewing agency under Accumulative lens: thread density intensifies until the plates merge, narrowing options to a single decisive act; cost is visible in raw fingers and empty plates, though not "unmistakable" per quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Lirael’s agency (aligning the sundial, rebuilding), but pressure lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens. The harmonic tone moment deepens meaning yet fails to narrow options—she "chooses to follow" without prior tactics-altering cost beyond breath catching.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake (decoding the message to understand the past) tightens through Lira's agency: scanning margins narrows options to fountain search, with conceptual cost (realizing the Collapse didn't erase "us") made visceral via grandmother's hologram. Pressure coheres under causal lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. council control) tightens via the star’s movement, but coup pressure remains abstract backdrop rather than visceral, on-page test; Jaxon’s telescope warning lacks escalation cost beyond intellectual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through atmospheric accumulation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; Lirael passively receives revelations rather than making choices that narrow options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through scribble decryption, but "after anesthetic" timeframe fails to tighten decisions; cost feels conceptual without tangible tactical alteration from initial collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (joy vs. fog's silence) tightens through protagonist agency: her display transforms elegy into communal resurrection. Cost crystallizes when children's giggles "pierce the silence," reconfiguring the orchard's very identity under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation is driven entirely by Marisol’s agency (adjusting dish angle, whispering "Show me"), tightening the dominant stake (awakening secrets) until the conceptual cost—exchanging certainty for curiosity—becomes undeniable in the final image’s reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen through Lira’s agency (writing in tidal pools), but "days passed, then years, then centuries" summary weakens pressure escalation; cost ("centuries of longing") remains visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens intensifies through Lirael’s agency: her humming deepens into singing the lullaby, narrowing options as the director’s hologram flickers. Stakes reweight via density (stirring emotions, orchids blooming fiercer), with visible cost in the director’s wavering authority and Lirael’s softened regret. Pressure tightens relentlessly toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (trust restoration) tightens via linguistic work, but sister conflict remains off-page; pressure accumulates through "interconnected promises" method, though cost feels deferred rather than viscerally paid on the page during reconciliation attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake ("measure encrypted compassion") signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. External elements (amphitheater breathing, rivers roaring) don't force tactical shifts—Lira proceeds methodically without adapting to rising stakes. Cost remains conceptual; no visible price paid during decryption beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (truth vs deception) tightens through Elias’s research, culminating in his decision to deliver personally. Agency drives escalation (ignoring client notes, sketching symbols), with cost legible in "chest tightened" and the final "blooming and withering" trade-off under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes crystallize around "necessary distances" with tangible cost in Lira's irreversible departure. Escalation driven by her agency in code-writing, but internal/external conflict integration thins during the father's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (validation of Mara's belief in underwater rhythms) tightens through researchers' skepticism until alignment proves her right. Agency entirely Mara's; cost is her emotional exposure. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten via Lira’s seed experiment narrowing options to "release vs forget," with cost legible in the fog-consumed path. Agency drives escalation, but pressure lacks one more intensification before the pool revelation to enter 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation via density increase—neon flickers, drunk’s humming, clown’s loop—tightens the dominant stake (disrupting monotony) until the discord breaks the cycle. Cost is unmistakable in the held breath before applause.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via protagonist agency (stealing dust → applying → writing) narrows options under ban pressure, with visible cost in burning strokes, but the single tightening lacks deeper tactical shifts that could elevate cost legibility beyond physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (finding meaning in mundane) is signaled early but never concretized. Zero escalation: ritual works perfectly with no resistance, cost, or trade-offs. Peaceful resolution lacks visible price—stakes remain abstract despite strong thematic setup.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through Elias’s agency: opening the box changes knowledge from avoidance to acceptance. Cost legible in "throat tightened" and scarred face softening. Single deepening suffices for length but lacks mid-beat tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: balloon trials narrow options via pattern density ("17" resonance), with visible cost in the silver thread’s expended energy charging the final image under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through the groaning walls and diaries’ warnings, but the alcove’s sudden reveal feels coincidental rather than earned by Lira’s agency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: humming’s deepening density ("coded lullabies adapting") narrows options as mirrors react, with visible cost in "sweating" and faltering song. Dominant stake (showing possibilities) viscerally reweights through meadow/city/forest reflections.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen through micro-choices (tapping clipboard, guiding clauses) with visible cost in "shaking hands" signatures, but escalation lacks one tangible forfeiture beyond emotional regret.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake tightening via sensory accumulation (thunder, salt, light) is masterful under accumulative lens, but "meaning was what you manufactured" slightly over-articulates the moral calculus, diluting the earned cost in peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (defying conformity) escalate through dance intensity under Accumulative lens, but cost remains abstract; the "humming lullaby" lacks tangible consequence beyond thematic resonance, weakening escalation’s visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when drifter scoffs ("making excuses for half-truths"), forcing Elias's reversal—a protagonist-driven escalation that reweights ethical cost through visible agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: trembling hands knotting silk under time pressure (monarch’s arrival) forecloses permanence. Cost legible in lattice’s dissolution, though migration’s urgency lacks live-clock tension.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (preserving erased voices) tighten through rope’s resistance and snapping threads. One meaningful escalation: light coalescing into beam forces crystallization. Cost legible via "hands raw but steady" and names burning brighter—conceptual price of memory’s fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake ("why paths choose walkers") tightens meaningfully as storm breaks, but escalation lacks visceral cost during hologram beat. Conceptual price (accepting decay as seed) lands at dawn, yet tension deflates too neatly with storm's passage.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: arranging tiles transforms "encrypted devotion" into self-covenant with felt cost. The rumble-to-bioluminescence escalation forecloses external answers, making the conceptual cost ("tile offered only questions") unmistakable under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through synchronized breathing sequence—protagonist agency drives escalation as breath coordination narrows options. Cost crystallizes when Elias relinquishes the mirror, foreclosing dream-return path with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (mending legacy) tightens via copper wire application, but cost remains conceptual (no tangible loss); pressure deepens through Accumulative lens yet lacks visceral forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.3)
    Textural escalation intensifies through sensory density (spiders → ash → velvet books) under Accumulative lens. Cost (pride) legible at mirror door; humming as agency-driven deepening reweights knowledge stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: pressing the calliope key triggers the staircase, transforming Veyra's "myth" skepticism into active participation. Cost crystallizes when Lira realizes "the garden isn't a place—it's a choice," paying emotional price through inherited memories. Single deepening (sewing names) suffices for length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: hum intensifies → she focuses on spiral → bloom materializes. Cost legible in physical toll ("teeth ached; ears rang" → "ribs no longer aching"). Dominant stake (silence vs dissonance) signaled early and tightened through causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake ("prove coincidences have meaning") escalates through failed attempts to storm climax. Cost is visceral (bloodied fingers) and conceptual (enduring the void). Agency drives resolution—her adjustment causes the hum—but early stakes could feel more urgent to reach 9.3+.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (defying hopelessness) tighten through Lira's agency: chanting guides her, ambient awareness narrows options, "filter" triggers bloom. Non-closure Accumulation Cap (-0.8) for mentor's guidance feeling convenient (knot flare as deus ex machina), slightly undermining pressure legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (communicating during conflict) tightens via Elara’s agency: repositioning cicada alters tactics. Cost is unmistakable in the "pause" they navigate—Kael’s softened shoulders show earned progress without resolution. Escalation driven by her tangible choices under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten via gravity countdown clock, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven cost: doll loss feels coincidental, not earned through Lila's agency (e.g., reaching recklessly), weakening pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through textural escalation as noise monitoring deepens into silence revelation. Agency via observation alone is sufficient for Accumulative lens, but external pressure remains underdeveloped despite conceptual cost being unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sunrise deadline creates palpable temporal pressure, narrowing options as the sky shifts violet. Yet the guardian trial's resolution relies on convenient coincidence—the flake's void-filling function emerges abruptly without prior causal hints, undermining agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (threshold collapse vs. isolation) tightens when Kael crosses the threshold, shuddering the sanctuary. Cost is visceral: her "trembling" hands and "burned bridges" admission.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single tightening (turning the bolt) narrows options decisively under Accumulative pressure. Cost is unmistakable in trembling diamonds dissolving and farm stabilization, though Dr. Voss’s "manic curiosity" feels slightly underdeveloped as antagonistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (truth about dynasty's end) tightens through crank turns escalating to visions. Agency-driven escalation (Lirael's choices narrow options to sacrifice), with cost legible in weeping and legacy shift. Minor convenience in gramophone mechanics prevents 9.0 under quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes crystallize via "unsnap the strings" action with visible cost (machinery destruction, armor loss). Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds through reality shifts, though "shivering bliss" introduction lacks causal setup in pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (reclaiming erased lives) tighten through Elias’ agency: dust analysis forces a trade-off (abstract hope vs tangible action). Cost is legible in his trembling hands and "heart full" realization, but the timeframe lacks a live clock escalating pressure beyond the button’s discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten causally when drones force dive—agency-driven escalation. Cost (station explosion) visibly alters tactics. Physics flaw in "Dive!" yell slightly undermines pressure legibility at peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through sensory density (colors deepening to violet), but antagonist defeat feels coincidental—Elias's "frantic staccato" lacks tactical choice beyond volume, missing agency-driven escalation for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elinor’s agency (prod → monuments → decoding), but the storm/silverseed warnings lack visceral immediacy; cost remains conceptual (dust’s dissolution) without physical or relational toll on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when compass spins instead of pointing north, narrowing options to embracing uncertainty. Agency drives escalation (improvised tools, falling into shaft), with visceral cost (jolted ribs) and conceptual price paid in the garden decision.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding Lira's fate) tightens via ritual escalation. Cost is legible in Kael's endurance of ambiguity, but "kintsugi intentions" line explains rather than dramatizes the pressure shift.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: her fear admission ("laughter is not enough") forces the harp figure’s challenge, narrowing options to wield the tooth. Cost is embodied in throat-aching laughter and the tooth’s pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes crystallize through intuition-driven escalation (ink revealing hyper-detail), but lacks one visible price paid during attempts; tension remains conceptual. Agency shines via Lira’s sensory choices narrowing options, though the single deepening beat (mural shift) slightly under-escalates for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by Elias' agency under Accumulative lens—dust analysis leads to ceiling investigation—narrowing options to confronting hidden truths. Cost ("legs shaking," "chest tight") is legible but could deepen the physical toll of ghostly weight; the single tightening suffices yet lacks visceral trade-off beyond emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (rupturing the library’s cage) tightens through Elara’s agency aligning press rhythms with frost dissolution. The spiral anomaly escalates pressure meaningfully, narrowing options to "rupture or stagnation." Cost is felt in the patrons’ transformation—"remembered things forgotten"—but moral calculus lacks competing goods in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake (proving historical truth) tightens meaningfully during storm vision. Kael’s agency drives escalation (covering mirrors, planting seeds), but Council opposition lacks deepening—tearing drapes feels reductive for high-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s confession as the sole meaningful escalation, narrowing options to truth or silence. Cost is felt in her “crumpled” face and the stone’s flare, but Elias’s prompt (“you must admit”) slightly dilutes protagonist agency in the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Lira's psychometry agency: expedition visions narrow options toward conceptual cost. The compass malfunction crystallizes stakes with felt price ("expedition hadn’t vanished—they’d crossed"), though factory shutdown timeframe doesn’t tighten decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (deciphering island's history) tightens when Lira steps through the portal, but escalation lacks visceral cost—complexity becoming "burden" remains abstract. Agency in pressing the slide drives change, yet the conceptual price isn't legible in the final image beyond intellectual realization.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake ("why flowers bloom at night") signaled early but never viscerally threatened; no concrete cost scales with length. Pressure grows texturally yet lacks on-page trade-off or tactical shift when stakes peak.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate causally from Elara’s warning to Mara’s death vision, culminating in trapdoor choice that sacrifices codex retrieval; Preservation Society reveal feels slightly convenient but cost ("truth’s out there") lands.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' agency as memory work intensifies (ledger/compass scavenging → lanterns brightening), but pressure lacks visceral escalation—ghosts materializing feels coincidental rather than earned by prior choices. Cost is felt (emotional exhaustion) but not visibly reconfigured until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reopening path) tightens with egg hatching, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening under accumulative lens. "Decrease entropy" mechanic told not tested—no visible price paid during seed scattering that alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes crystallize early: bell tone must pierce air to prevent chaos. Escalation via rope switch narrows options (only one method works), with cost in Lira’s realization she "agitated the storms" and must now actively maintain balance through rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (science vs. spiritual vulnerability) tightens meaningfully at impact site, but escalation lacks Veyra’s active pressure—his shift feels reactive rather than driven by Zara’s agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding time’s texture) tightens through Elias’s descriptions triggering artifact responses. Cost legible when urn fragment "vibrated" to show his wife—visible tradeoff of relinquishing the talisman for insight.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Internal stake (creating meaning vs. accepting impermanence) tightens through Lira's deepening realization; the snapped kite string forces her response ("tending, weaving, harmonizing"). Cost is visceral in dissolving threads—visible trade-off between creation and transience.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through deepening resonance: the spirit’s "It hurts" reweights the dominant harmony goal, and her life ("six months left") is the visible cost crystallized in the final breath "soft as copper on oak".

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake ("can homecoming be engineered?") tightens through Lirael's agency—rejecting Kael's vial to test the amber—narrowing options to self-recognition. Cost is unmistakable in her unraveled skepticism and aching longing. Under accumulative lens, sculpture density and resonance field deepening reweight stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when tern's cry triggers "Khalis," deepening resolve under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "fertilizer mixed from memories of reef’s final gasp," but reef’s death lacks immediate tactical pressure during planting.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (community connection) signaled early but escalation lacks pressure; riddles solved without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs. Agency isn't tested—wind "carries something else" feels coincidental rather than earned causality under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stake (confusion vs. exploration) tightens through glimpse-induced grandmother encounter; agency-driven escalation as Elio's path choice reconfigures "true north" with felt cost in smudged sketch and irreversible perspective shift.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (spire collapse) escalate via physical reactions to swaps: ice cracks → violent shaking. Agency clear in Kael's methodical swaps. Cost legible through relief ("weight lift") but "high-pitched whine" after bishop swap adds redundant pressure without deepening stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when king topples, forcing realization that pawns "were her" with visible cost. But interregnum timeframe lacks live-clock pressure; "liminal period" remains atmospheric rather than tactical constraint.

    Dominant stake (memory pain vs. need to remember) tightens via feather-seeding action, narrowing options to endure or flee. Cavern earthquake escalates via coincidence (rocks tumbling), slightly undercutting protagonist agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation driven by sensory density ("hush fell... ground trembled... light burst") under Accumulative lens. Cost ("price of forgiveness") remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; "courage to let go" tells rather than embodies the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through sensory density (pool reflection, warm water surprise), but mirror-crack urgency lacks a live clock to deepen the "temporary eternity" pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (proving whispers > shouts) tightens through Elara’s agency: her humming deepens intent’s physical manifestation (vial glow → sea churn → village impact).

Escalation driven purely by protagonist’s choices under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation through midnight calls builds pressure accumulatively, but protagonist agency feels passive—Mara executes instructions rather than making contested choices, diluting the dominant stake's urgency; cost is emotional (tears) yet not visibly tied to her actions beyond obedience.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal safety to societal truth-telling via Jorn’s ledger, but resolution lacks tangible cost—Mara’s hope feels unearned as no sacrifice (e.g., destroying the ledger) concretely narrows options under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (returning stolen memories) deepens when woman reveals captain “took my daughter,” narrowing Elias’s options to action or complicity. His agency drives escalation; cost (“carried enough”) alters tactics toward restitution.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: ledger discovery forces reevaluation of "revalue" concept, narrowing options from forcing resonance to collaborative alignment. Cost unmistakable in "three sun engines lost" and conceptual shift. Stakes could feel more visceral beyond city's chill.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (grave→scroll→climb); "jealousy coiled" crystallizes cost, but internal conflict escalation lacks one tangible trade-off beat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (unresolved guilt) tightens through Lira's discovery process, but agency remains observational rather than active choice. Cost is felt ("chest light") yet insufficiently visible for 8.8+ band. Escalation valid under Accumulative lens via density increase in engraving revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: the "saturated hush" deepens into "roared to life" as ink crystallizes, narrowing Kael’s options to embracing transformation. Cost is legible in scars shifting from "map of failures" to "language only he could read."

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: the voice’s accusation ("You left me here") forces song completion, narrowing options. Cost—empty bottle, roaring chainsaws—is unmistakable and reweights reconciliation as bittersweet loss.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (unraveling illusions) tightens through Witness's agency: mural's "see yourself" forces internal confrontation, with cost visible in "profound peace" after soul-vision.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (understanding time’s nature) deepens via counting ritual, but escalation lacks visible price altering tactics. Revelation feels passive—no trade-off or cost until the final realization, failing the "altered tactics" requirement for high-band scores.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten causally: the farm’s "afraid" barriers escalate to a resonant threat (dimmed lights, mushrooms glowing preemptively), narrowing Kael to one choice—matching Lira’s voice frequency. Cost is unmistakable in "pests didn’t flood in; instead, a gentle rain of spores fell," but the conceptual price (relinquishing control) lacks visceral physicality, slightly diluting the trade-off’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when lantern heat warps scrawls into actionable choice ("left at fork where time bends"), forcing trade-off between paths with visceral cost in tears. Pressure grows through Clara's agency interpreting scribbles, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stake (transforming isolation into connection) tightens through Mara’s agency: each disc-spinning choice narrows options (routing calls) while deepening the cost of her endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (covenant unraveling) tighten through proximate causes motif; pressure coheres as Elara’s ritual deepens. Cost (emotional vigilance) is felt but not physically constrained—needed one more beat where jetty’s state directly impedes action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten when ghost redefines loneliness as unspoken language, narrowing Elias's options from "cure" to "conversation." His agency (placing rock, stepping forward) drives escalation under accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in the visceral chest-ache reduction—a felt price for reframing the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency—wading the Silver Vein to "dig" narrows options. Cost legible in the map’s "trembling" and lifelong quest resolution, though emotional price could deepen marginally at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (fixing timeline edit) tightens through Lira's projection revealing alternatives, forcing trade-off between control and collaboration. Cost legible in "editing history wasn't about erasing mistakes" realization, with agency driving Elias's walk to the farmer.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes deepen via Lira’s participation (silence→collective vulnerability), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Cost remains observational ("twinge of sadness") rather than altering Kael’s tactics or future choices.

Eli’s "hesitation" before drumming is too minor to justify the sorrow-to-hope shift; a visible trade-off (e.g., exhaustion or injury flare-up) would have anchored the price under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (navigating labyrinth) tightens via storm's escalating interference, but "double pay" challenge lacks visceral cost; whispers vs. shouts dichotomy deepens knowledge without sufficient tactical trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (soothing canal’s "unspoken ache") deepen through pattern density, but cost remains conceptual (perpetual duty) rather than viscerally felt. Agency in shutter manipulation narrows options, yet the "stillwater tension" lacks escalation beyond softening—no tangible loss or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate via Lila’s unspoken words shifting from "I’m alone" to "I’m learning," narrowing options through Clara’s micro-choices. Agency falters as Clara’s father revelation feels coincidental, not earned by her tactics, limiting escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: her decision to follow the call and detach scrimshaw narrows options to irreversible departure. Cost is unmistakable in "island fractured, pieces... slipping into the sea like tears," foreclosing home with visceral, felt loss under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Lirael's whittling ritual under Accumulative pressure, with the disintegrating bouquet embodying the cost of preserving grief. Agency is clear, but the mandate's enforcement feels distant; the cost needs sharper tactical consequences beyond symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen texturally (humming intensifies → ice cracks) but agency feels passive—Lirael's paraphrasing magically alters reality without earned cost or tactical tradeoffs; pressure lacks visceral stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (proving beauty in imperfection) tightens through Elias' agency: arranging withered rose risks failure, then cobalt dust forces irreversible perceptual cost. Escalation via Accumulative lens—plants' rustling to symphony—narrows options to embracing flawed vision, though Marla's confession slightly softens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (reconnecting with sound) remains abstract; no concrete test of stakes despite grid collapse backdrop. Escalation is coincidental (cave hums when touched) not driven by agency, violating Causal lens. Cost feels conceptual not viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (transforming grief) tightens when shadows become "intentions," narrowing options to continued labor. Cost legible in bleeding fingers and "quiet, burning certainty"—not just emotional but embodied sacrifice under Accumulative lens. Agency drives escalation through lantern adjustments.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (mapping cultural collapse) tightens via pattern accumulation, but Mara’s arrival lacks tangible cost escalation; conceptual cost lands cleanly in closure though emotional stakes feel thin.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (truth vs safety) tightens through Kael's accusation forcing stance crystallization. Escalation via textural deepening (carvings shifting → glowing → liquid gold) reweights cost, but "end of innocence" abstraction slightly dilutes visceral stakes in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate via density (shadow's hunger sharpening), but antagonistic pressure underdeveloped—why "bloom" resolves crisis feels unearned; protagonist agency strong in video comparison, yet final turn lacks visible tradeoff beyond emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation of sensory/emotional weight toward dawn, but dominant conflict (compassion vs. exploitation) lacks external pressure points; cost of shed fears is earned yet slightly abstract for high-band escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (decoding grief through scars) tightens via accumulative pressure: each coffee-ring vision deepens the wound while narrowing Mara’s path to acceptance. Her agency drives escalation—choosing which ring to examine alters knowledge and tactics, with the scar’s throbbing providing consistent cost. The final shattering hourglass reweights options without coincidence, fulfilling the band guardrail with "visible price that charges the final image."

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when Mara realizes letters are literal, not metaphorical. Agency drives escalation via rewinding film, with cost (emotional vulnerability) legible in tears and lilac scent. One deepening suffices, but the cost could feel more consequential for her future.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (freeing creativity) signaled early but pressure never tightens—Kael faces no opposition or meaningful trade-off. Chamber's arrival via coincidence undermines Accumulative escalation; cost ("mind buzzed") lacks felt loss.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation tightens through Kael’s agency under accumulative lens as the archive’s hum seeps into his bones, but the cost—while resonant—remains conceptual rather than visceral; the forest’s loss lacks on-page forfeiture that alters tactics during the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes (find wild frontier) lack escalation—no tradeoffs or narrowed options. "Let go" demand faces zero resistance; father’s hologram vanishes without emotional cost altering tactics. Strength: dominant stake signaled early via "raw, untamed world" quest.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes ("find unused courage") stay abstract—no dramatized trade-offs or costs during journey. Escalation is atmospheric (twilight deepening) not pressure-driven; the ridgeway’s shifts complicate without altering tactics. Cost legibility relies on thematic assertion, not concrete forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through Elric’s agency: neglecting the bolt (his choice) escalates to the "unpardonable silence," forcing him to confront silence as "contract." The cost—sacrificing his seraphic mundanity—is visible when he speaks, reconfiguring the fortress’s entire safety paradigm. One decisive deepening suffices perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Veyra's agency: deciphering messages → interpreting celestial pause → hurling ink at critical moment. Cost is unmistakable in pretender's "voice dissolving into static" and hollow revelation. One tightening (convergence timing) sufficiently forecloses pretender's path under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (meaning in chaos) tighten via resonance peak, narrowing options to "listen." Lira’s agency drives escalation, but Jax’s conversion lacks friction—his skepticism softens too smoothly despite prior "ghosts" dismissal, slightly muddying cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten causally: regime's weaponized destiny versus her "seed" insight. Pressure peaks when plants hiss "choose wisely," forcing trade-off with visible cost in her exhaustion and implied social risk.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (grief as void vs. shape) tightens through the wind-triggered flashback, forcing Lila’s somatic choice with visible cost (fragile hope). Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens lacks one nuanced intensification in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: walls closing in force descent into staircase, narrowing options to internal focus. Cost is legible in transformed despair ("ribs ache") to anticipation, reweighting the stake of fragmentation through tactile thread-weaving.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (time fragmentation vs preserving memory) tightens through pattern accumulation: ink reveals tower, child's drawing confirms "time gets stuck." Agency in Lira's intuition ("snapping into focus") drives escalation; conceptual cost legible in "memory of her brother—vanished forever" at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when Lira redefines "quiet" as focus, narrowing her path to active stewardship. The cost is visible in her calloused hands (soil, not combat) and the abandoned penance. Agency drives escalation: her digging/humming transforms the scrap, avoiding coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes tighten via pattern breaks (dissonant zigzag → fractured notes), but escalation leans on predetermined ritual ("if he voiced the right silence") rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative lens. Cost legible yet tactical shifts feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten causally when the memo transforms abstract suspicion into concrete evidence, forcing Clara’s agency ("write your story"). Cost is visceral in "mother wept, 'How could you?'" but journalist’s arrival slightly softens the escalation’s causal purity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (silenced dissonance) tightens meaningfully when Lira reads the letter, softening cries into hum; but the "dissonance will consume us all" stakes remain abstract until the nursery, lacking visible price paid during escalation (e.g., no physical toll during firmware entry).

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes crystallize through Mara's agency—pressing the tile shudders the grotto, narrowing options from observation to interjection. Cost is legible in the breathing silence, though visceral personal risk remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes (mending fractured possibilities) signaled early, but escalation lacks visible cost until finale. Agency drives echoes, yet Elias never confronts personal trade-offs (e.g., sacrificing one timeline's tragedy for "collective possibility").

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single stake (authentic awareness vs. corporate shortcuts) tightens through Elias's deepening somatic work; agency-driven escalation narrows options to his method with visible cost (refusing refunds).

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via sensory density (heat-mapper colors → golden spores), but pressure lacks meaningful deepening; the gust complication doesn’t raise stakes organically, and Lira’s agency feels passive as the fossil "yearns" to guide her without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (unlocking echo) tightens through button-sorting method, but "raw possibility" cost remains abstract. Agency drives escalation yet lacks visible price beyond conceptual shift; "unscramble chaos" deepening feels under-tested by physical consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten when Mara transcribes despite paranoia, narrowing options to "trust or remain broken," but external spy networks feel secondary; cost is legible in her self-confrontation, though pressure leans heavily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (preserving layered promise) deepen through sensory accumulation, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. No live option foreclosed; cost remains conceptual without tangible trade-off altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via sunflower discovery and lantern’s thrumming, narrowing Mara’s options to observation over action; cost (enduring the wasteland’s hunger) is legible but agency remains passive—understanding feels received, not wrested from pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation via the hum’s crescendo narrows options to coexistence vs. dissolution; cost is legible in her shift from "fragile, brittle moment" to observing the world "without fear," though one tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through Lila’s agency: touching the spiral, writing her secret, watching orbs sink. The felt cost—years of hollow connection—narrows options toward speaking truths aloud. Elara’s guidance slightly softens pressure, but the core tension remains viscerally personal.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (community division vs. cosmic chaos) tighten through Lila's frequency gamble, with visible cost in the haunting note. But tricksters' motivation ("power plays for sport") lacks depth, weakening the moral calculus of her interference.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when corridor bends ("walls bending like rubber"), forcing compass intervention with visible cost (claustrophobia sharpening). Agency drives escalation via lunge triggering spatial shift. Spatial mutiny’s mechanics feel slightly external, lacking deeper causal roots.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Clara’s agency: tracing the handprint with Voss shifts knowledge from "why the ribbon?" to recognizing Lila’s humanity. Cost is the locket’s emotional weight, narrowing options toward reopening the case—escalation driven by her empathy-focused method under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (breaking cyclical greed) signaled early through father’s "snake eating its tail" motif. Pressure accumulates via bill placements deepening Marcus' unraveling under Accumulative lens. But stakes remain slightly abstract—greed’s visceral cost isn’t embodied until the final reflection, slightly diluting mid-beat urgency. One tightening (founders' fraying trust) suffices; cost crystallizes in the conceptual shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: Lirael's choice to "let the words wash over her" deepens the burden-density, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is legible when glyphs morph into "a lullaby in her brother's handwriting" etched into her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (confronting buried guilt) tighten through Mira's agency: stepping in, releasing seed, facing vision. Cost is unmistakable in "chest tightened" and the "poisoning" guilt, culminating in the earned shift to "heart lighter" with visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through scar-link method activation narrowing options to "accept pain of both worlds"; dread curdling from anxious elation creates meaningful pressure shift, though hesitation claim lacks prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes in soul-patching escalate through Lirael’s agency: bartering the Fool card, sewing the skeleton, and eating the fruit narrow options toward earned renunciation of certainty. Cost is legible in the fruit’s "heartbeat not her own" and transformed vision of the drowned boy.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten when cloth reveals Echo Valley’s failure, forcing Lenny’s call. Agency-driven escalation works, but Gus’s "toss it" pressure lacks consequence; cost (emotional vulnerability) is felt but not visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Elara’s analogical thinking, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—seed activation feels passive rather than earned through her choices. "Touching distance from chaos" creates tension, yet no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The haunting ambition concept shapes thematic weight but doesn’t alter tactics mid-scene. Resolution feels inevitable rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (identity transformation) tightens when woman’s "routine is a cage" fear crystallizes into diving choice, foreclosing her old form with visible cost (shed scales → feathers). Escalation driven by librarian’s agency ("Dive into the creel") under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in her "lighter" state, though the stakes’ moral complexity could deepen further for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (connecting abandoned hopes) tightens through Elias’s agency: placing the pearl narrows options (dissolving relic for connection). Cost is conceptual—pearl vanishes but "light lingered," altering his life’s purpose. Escalation driven by accumulating confessions’ emotional weight, not coincidence, under Accumulative lens. One tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through Mara's agency: following drainpipe chalk line to riverbank, then drawing her heart map. Cost is visceral—shaking hands as clinical detachment shatters. Medication absence doesn't actively narrow options; "three weeks" remains backstory not live clock.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Empire vs garden stake tightens via violin’s snapping strings (cadence shift), with visible cost in final ache. However, "perforated destiny" concept is echoed thematically but never actively constrains tactics—feels descriptive rather than causal under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation via pool cracking narrows options meaningfully under Accumulative lens. Cost (potential loss of all echoes) is felt but lacks earlier tangible trade-offs; single intensification barely meets scope requirements for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (contentment via rebirth cycle) tighten through Lirael’s choices, but merchant’s guilt-driven return feels convenient, slightly diluting the earned cost of trust.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (guilt vs. peace) signaled early; chime unhooking deepens knowledge. But Mira’s agency feels coached—Elias drives the action, weakening protagonist-driven escalation. Cost (ghost laughter) legible but not earned through her autonomous trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation through accumulating stone throws deepens under Accumulative lens, but temporal pressure ("days passed") lacks concrete cost escalation until Lira’s decisive throw.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes ("sacred in simple") tighten through Kael's agency (pouring starlight → garden shift), cost legible in frozen tears and foreclosed quest for "impossibilities"; escalation sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stake ("how to wavelength align") tightens when coins form a circuit, narrowing options from confusion to alignment; cost of shed doubt is visible but insufficiently embodied, missing the 8.8+ band's demand for visceral price at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through one meaningful Accumulative escalation: forgotten phrases → resistance ("Do not name them") → tangible monsters. Agency is clear—Elias chooses naming despite warnings—and cost legibility shines in the atlas page's newfound weight. Band guardrails satisfied: the "distant intimacy" reconfiguration charges the final image with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is pure Accumulative pressure: Elias’s agency narrows options through incremental drip adjustments under baking sun, culminating in the live-clock tension of "as the last fish was caught." Cost is unmistakable in his collapse and the rift’s temporary "stitch," fulfilling the Q4 9+ test.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (memory preservation vs. erasure) tighten through Mara’s agency: discovering the label, laying photos, and accepting guardianship narrow options under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (harmonizing logic/intuition) signaled early with one meaningful deepening via starling patterns, but escalation relies on external revelation (bird dance) rather than protagonist agency; cost legible in final sentiment-as-shield realization.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (identity autonomy) tightens via clone's "obsolete" taunt forcing Kael's "vivify" gambit. Cost legible in brain's dimmed light and raw emotions, but custody battle mechanics lack mid-scene tactical trade-offs.

    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency (planting seed), but escalation lacks visible cost; panic over missing plant dissipates without altering tactics or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (restoring laughter) tighten through escalating physical cost (blisters, hoarse voice), but pressure lacks protagonist-driven deepening; tunnel’s response feels coincidental rather than earned by his choices. Cost legible yet agency passive in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes crystallize through Mara’s agency: her wait (active interiorization) tightens options, and tossing the pendant incurs immediate cost (cultist’s collapse), reweighting "light boundaries" as doors under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative pressure: ember winds howling, silver scorching skin, and the "jagged line" crack tightening Kael’s options until the blood sacrifice becomes the only path to interrupt destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when Kael’s console dismantling narrows options—discarded cogs force reliance on the fragment’s frequency. Cost crystallizes in the fragment’s searing heat and inert aftermath, reweighting "endings as doorways" under the Accumulative lens through visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (merging timelines to free passengers) tightens via Kael’s radio broadcast, narrowing options to a binary choice. Cost is legible (ferry’s dissolution), but moral calculus lacks depth—the "unravel reality" risk is acknowledged yet resolved too cleanly without tangible tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens: Clara’s agency tightens pressure through weaving density until eruption, narrowing options to "weave her own path" with visceral cost ("unraveling sanity" made real through altered memories and the curator’s vanished form).

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen when the hearing aid pulses synchronize, narrowing Lila's path to delivering the message. But escalation relies on environmental discovery (finding the second device) rather than protagonist agency under pressure; the "reeling hush" moment lacks tangible cost beyond emotional weight, missing the 8.8+ requirement for visible price altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes narrow causally: tide rising → water to ankles → waist, forcing the terminal action. Lira’s agency (slapping on the fleck) creates irreversible cost (proof is data, not reunion), with visible tradeoffs between escape and verification.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reconciling life/death error) tightens through ink pattern deepening; agency in "defragmenting" reconfigures meaning. Cost is conceptual (permanent ghost as guide) but lacks tangible tactical consequence—elevation hinges entirely on internal reframing.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by protagonist’s agency: bird-pattern observations tighten into humming that fractures the diamond’s vein. Cost is visceral (burning palm, near-fall) and conceptual (fear of oblivion weaponized), reweighting stakes under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten via static confessions forcing metamorphosis, but escalation feels compressed; the cost of shedding human identity is conceptualized yet lacks tangible forfeiture beyond vague "fear of irrelevance."

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: violin-to-shell shift narrows options with visible cost (snapped string, bleeding fingers). Stakes tighten through music's intensification, culminating in the geyser eruption that reconfigures the dominant stake—mechanized order versus wild magic—with statues' empty sockets as conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency (smuggling bottle), but escalation lacks visible cost escalation—soldiers lowering guns feels coincidental, not earned by protagonist’s actions under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (finding beauty in quiet) tightens through singing climax, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation—wind bells' chime conveniently reveals door without prior struggle, missing one key tightening beat under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen organically from restlessness to reawakening, with agency clear in scarf ritual; minor flaw: cost (transformed perspective) feels underweighted against the magical experience's scale.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through light accumulation, but escalation relies on dream agency ("you’ve been chasing me") rather than protagonist-driven pressure; the cost of dissolution feels conceptual rather than viscerally paid in the vitalization beat.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake tightening crystallizes when locket clicks: reality fractures immediately ("colors bled," "insubstantial" stones). Elias’s agency drives escalation; cost (physical/spatial dislocation) is visceral and inescapable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (recover memories) tightens through Elias’s agency mapping constellations to wrecks. Cost is felt in locket’s easing weight but lacks visceral physical tradeoff. Escalation deepens via broken-star pattern, foreclosing skepticism for belief.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Lirael’s tea leaf ritual—agency-driven deepening where geometry "shows a convergence." Cost is legible in "confront what you’ve avoided," but escalation leans slightly on thematic resonance over tangible pressure shifts in the woman’s dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes viscerally tighten as accumulated whispers escalate pressure under Mara's agency, but the dominant "fear of truth" stake lacks concrete pre-climax testing beyond her admission, slightly muting cost legibility before the burst of light.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (silence as language) tightens via film comparison revealing carving shifts; cost manifests in Elias’s worldview shift, but the "reopening" mechanism lacks sufficient friction—no tangible sacrifice beyond intellectual surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single stake (memory persistence/dissolution) deepens via frequency pattern discovery; cost ("quiet, analytic ache") legible but slightly abstract; agency in analytical choices (rewinding tape) drives accumulative escalation under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (unspoken needs) signaled early; storm intensifies encoding urgency. Agency clear in graffiti choices, but pressure lacks meaningful narrowing of options—Elias works uninterrupted until rain washes messages.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Mara’s agency: adjusting goggles narrows options by revealing hidden ice patterns, forcing confrontation with the widow; escalation culminates in the symbols’ unfolding, with cost visible in the widow’s shattered detachment (“hands shook as she took them”).

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through cloud observations deepening (sorrow stratus → rage nimbus → hope cirrus). Agency shifts goal from "prove" to "memorialize" with visible cost: revoked grant, peers' mockery, and identity transformation crystallized in "it'll change me."

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten texturally as demolition rumble interrupts her reading, forcing rapid shift from observation to action; pressure coheres via Accumulative lens, but Lira’s agency feels reactive—she adapts rather than makes a hard choice with deeper emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate causally from puzzle-solving (deciphering hopscotch) to life-risking action (the leap), with Lira’s agency narrowing options: obey the captain or pursue discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (finding gears to mend time) tightens meaningfully at wrong-coat reflection, but pressure lacks teeth—no tangible consequence for failure beyond abstract legacy weight. Liquid light pour drives agency, yet escalation feels slightly weightless for high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Mara's agency under Accumulative lens (glass vibration → fog spirals), but the "doubt" conflict resolves with minimal emotional friction; cost visible via shattered head and slowed clocks.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten via Kael’s agency under Situational pressure (birds forcing stealth during stone placement), but the traveler’s whimper as primary motivator lacks layered conflict with his reluctance. Cost is felt in the nut’s crack and resetting labyrinth, though the frost’s consequence remains slightly oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("glimmering parole" reweighted by the note's return), but escalation lacks visible trade-offs; felt cost ("grateful for the absence") suffices for length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (dilute remorse without becoming its vessel) tightens through Nessar's agency: pressing palms to door, submerging hands deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes (silence = rift) deepen through language-weaving, but pressure lacks agency-driven escalation—the weight’s "glow" emerges passively. Cost (villagers’ stirred wonder) is felt but not earned through prior trade-offs; the elevator’s shift feels coincidental, not pressured by Elara’s actions.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (entangle memories without self-loss) tightens when feedback loop threatens overwhelm; protagonist's dial adjustment forecloses safe experimentation with visceral cost ("memories bleeding into the mirror's"). Agency-driven escalation under causal lens.

    Time pressure tightens stakes effectively, but escalation leans on external event (gravity inversion) rather than protagonist-driven choices; cost is felt but not deeply earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes ("create music in silent world") signaled early but never tested against active resistance; escalation relies on repetition ("strummed until nails bled") rather than protagonist-driven deepening. Cost visible (shattered insulator) but pressure lacks narrowing options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation: silence's "weight of forgotten oaths" tightens to roaring nexus, narrowing options to the key insertion. Cost is visceral—Alaric's exile and tears—but "hopeful melancholy" slightly softens the earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten texturally through scent/doodle evolution, with elders’ skepticism creating credible secondary pressure. However, their opposition resolves off-page without testing Lira’s agency—cost (humility) lands only at bloom, weakening escalation’s causal weight under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the arrow fuses, foreclosing exploitation paths, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt; "truth to protect" lacks tangible sacrifice beyond mindset shift.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through wind intensification (45mph gusts) driven by Anya's agency (climbing, data cross-referencing), with visceral cost in the final realization. But the engineer's discovery relies slightly on coincidence rather than pure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through sensory escalation: oppressive silence → chisel strike → aurora pulses. Lira's agency drives each intensification (pressing sheet to lips, singing), with visible cost in her fogged breath and flushed cheeks. The Accumulative lens makes the felt cost unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (mastering the flute’s purpose) tightens through Kael’s discordant playing—agency drives the starfield collapse and Earned Stasis. Cost is unmistakable: snapped reeds, shattered past selves, and the visceral shift to "surrender" rune. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake (math vs. lived emotion) tightens through Elias's agency-driven disorientation experiment. Cost is unmistakable in his crumbling detachment and tears, though Veyra's "Stop!" lacks sufficient tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (validation vs truth) tighten through sensory accumulation until the frost shatters, narrowing options, but Mara’s passive observation weakens agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through puzzle fits (breeze → flute note → full song), with Mara’s agency narrowing options until the irreversible bead sacrifice reweights the dominant "carrying message" stake.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten causally: tunnel choices narrow options, shard assault forces endurance. Blood cost is unmistakable, but Lira’s warning lacks prior pressure escalation—Old Mara’s dissent feels isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (pursuing truth) tightens when shard overrides caution, forcing the jump. Visible price paid: lifelong search ends in hollow resolution ("weight was gone"). Escalation driven by Kael’s agency under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving safety’s essence) tightens through letter chain: each note narrows options (must stack stones, place glass). Elias’s agency drives escalation—his choices alter tactics (kerosene lantern use, stone placement). Cost is visceral: enduring darkness now "luminescent" with shared hope.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: tilting the lantern narrows options to "guide light without drowning in dark." Cost intensifies via emotional weight ("heavier dawn") and conceptual trade-off (light/dark as twins), with pressure cohering under Accumulative lens through shadow density escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (understanding narrative magnetism) tighten through Lin's agency observing patrons and releasing the wing, but escalation lacks sufficient friction; her transition to illuminator feels inevitable without visible trade-offs beyond the wing's loss.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen via moonlight’s healing constraint, but the pin-drop tension never meaningfully pressures the core sorrow-language realization, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by Lira's agency: pressing palm to mica window and humming deepens the song's power, narrowing options to fragile hope with unmistakable cost in her exhaustion and memory fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (grief resolution) tightens through Eleanor’s observation-to-participation shift, but "hiding" action remains passive; cost is legible via letters yet agency feels circumstantial rather than driven by her choices under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (fear of creeping normality) tightens when Elias chooses to plant seeds, narrowing options from passive observation to active rebellion. Pressure accumulates via saplings' growth under Accumulative lens, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven intensification beyond the initial planting act.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Midnight deadline creates meaningful tightening: Lira's agency drives escalation (e.g., false starts inform tower sprint), and sacrificing the fob pays visible cost. Dominant stake (stop device sale) is viscerally felt through the buyer's recording playback and shattered glass voice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (understanding compass/weather) tightens through sensory escalation. Kael's convergence action forecloses skepticism with visible cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, though forest-election urgency could heighten earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (suppressed creativity vs. stability) tightens through painting process; one meaningful deepening (lock morphing into scream-mouth) forecloses path with cost ("chest ache"). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens but cost legibility slightly softens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure deepens through the quill’s wilting and keeper’s confession, reweighting the "truth" stake, but escalation leans slightly on the keeper’s exposition rather than Elara’s agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder) signaled early but never viscerally tested; iceberg melting creates passive time pressure without narrowing Elara's options. Cost is felt ("sculpture shuddered, then stilled") but lacks agency-driven trade-offs under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single tightening through magnetic storm pressure narrows options to miniaturization. Agency-driven escalation works, but "controlled burn" concept introduced too late via memory weakens causal chain; dominant stake (contain chaos) lacks secondary pressure escalation beyond box leakage.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Mr. Hale identifies the lock type—Clara’s agency in dialing the numbers forecloses brute-force options. Cost is legible in her tears over the unfinished letter’s emotional and conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten texturally through hologram hum to strobing alarms, but drone resolution relies slightly on scientist’s precedent without Kael’s agency fully driving the escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming memories) tightens through gravity's physical pressure during tunnel descent; cost is legible in "new purpose" reframing, though whale timeframe's urgency remains underdeveloped despite early mourning setup.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens via protagonist agency: ritual deepens from tracing wing folds to mapping "gaps between heartbeats," narrowing options as brook stills. Cost is unmistakable in "crumbling to dust" with visible consequence (tranquil blaze extinguished if failed), fulfilling band guardrails for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: arranging shells forces memory confrontation. Cost is visceral in garden's destruction and "burning but not hurting" sparks. Minor deduction as isolation-to-independence shift lacks granular tactical tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via Accumulative density: aurora hues shifting across hands, dripping stalactites as temporal pressure, and blood-stain pulse deepen stakes; cost unmistakable in "pulsed faintly" as conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake ("why some echo") tightens through lullaby voice discovery, but pressure lacks protagonist agency—Kael *receives* revelations passively. Conceptual cost (eternal burden) is unmistakable, yet escalation relies on hooded figure’s convenience, not Kael’s choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation through dream shards deepens the dominant stake (healing connections) via Kael’s agency; the widow’s dream delivers unmistakable cost when "chest ached" at the lost daughter revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes deepen organically from abstract "meditation on absence" to decoding firefly patterns as intentional language. Agency-driven escalation via Kael's active tracing of rhythms with the whisk, but the singular pressure point lacks a second meaningful tightening for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (harnessing storm for new dawn) tightens via radio’s prism instruction, but escalation driven by external transmissions, not Kael’s agency. Conceptual cost of transformation lacks visceral felt weight despite resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: each jar poured tightens the stake of preserving lost voices. Cost unmistakable in "tears pricking his eyes" and the lifelong burden implied by "jars of silence," reweighting options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as the ghost's wail forces Elias to match pitch, narrowing options to sonic harmony or annihilation. Cost manifests in physical exhaustion ("legs burned, vision blurring") and conceptual shift, but the ghost's motivation remains underdeveloped, slightly muting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (aligning moon/viaduct) tightens via filing failures and physical strain; cost is Kael's transformed patience. Escalation is protagonist-driven (resetting filings, adjusting degrees) but lacks a live option foreclosure beyond initial failure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through Marcus’s agency: his realization that "repairing lives" requires tangible action narrows options to carrying the heart. Cost is legible in the physical burden ("tucked safely under his arm"), though escalation feels gentle rather than urgent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Lira's agency: transliterating visions alters glider tactics under acid-mist pressure; cost crystallizes in the bell's conceptual hum (unheard sound made visceral), reweighting the dominant stake unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (creative meaning vs. emotional safety) tighten through Lila’s dialogue fragments, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; her walking decision feels externally prompted by Elias’s wisdom rather than internal trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes ("preserve the echo") lack concrete escalation; pressure grows through density not agency. Prophet's role feels coincidental ("amplified the signal"), and no tactical cost alters Mara's approach despite "scars and serenity" reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (transmuting grief) deepens via sensory accumulation, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; dove feather break intensifies reflection without altering tactics. Cost felt but not visibly reconfigured in choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (decoding patterns vs academic dismissal) is signaled early but lacks escalation. The cost (colleagues' skepticism) is visible yet abstract—no dramatized obstacle tightens options or forces trade-offs under Accumulative lens; the insight expands rather than narrows his path.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through visceral cost—raw hands, aching knees—as fog thins, narrowing Elias’s window to "capture the sound." Agency drives tightening (adjusting driftwood markers), but the resolution lacks sufficient resistance; the sound appears almost coincidentally after minor marker shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (control time vs. escape) tightens meaningfully: clock's acceleration forces restructure/leap. Elias's agency drives escalation (soldering, singing), and visible cost (abandoning safety) charges the closure. Foundation quakes feel slightly under-motivated as escalation drivers.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake (bridging fear/acceptance) tightens through Accumulative escalation: hymn density increases to crescendo, then skips as Elias dies. Protagonist agency drives deepening ("hymning the mundane" method). Cost unmistakable in "loosening grip" and flatlined monitors.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes center on understanding "sealed awakenings" to solve the shadow mystery, tightening as the shadow-shift window approaches. Lirael's agency drives the climax (inserting the key), but the cost remains abstract—discovering the time-reversal realm lacks visceral forfeiture. Pressure coheres under the causal lens yet feels intellectually detached from personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes tighten when Elias reveals the tooth’s true cost (“sacrifice. A piece of yourself”), forcing Mara’s agency-driven choice to place both teeth. The tremor in her hand and Elias’s aged face manifest visceral cost, narrowing options to acceptance—a moral calculus between truth-seeking and personal loss that forecloses skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (sharing light without fire) signaled early but lacks escalation—internal conflict resolves via reflection alone. No meaningful tightening: "stillness" epiphany emerges from memory, not protagonist-driven pressure. Cost implied (releasing the pearl) but not dramatized as a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (fear of losing brother twice) tightens via Elias reframing drip pattern as "heartbeat," forcing Lila’s vulnerability. Protagonist agency drives escalation: unclasping pendant exposes inner layers. Cost is felt in weight shift and conceptual surrender—"expanding his story" over preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via Clara’s agency: rejecting the lantern-woman’s dissolution to rewrite the ending. Cost is felt in "crumbling into dust," but deepening lacks a second pressure point beyond the shell’s transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative density: threads weaving rituals → mushrooms bursting → stream singing, tightening Lira’s exhaustion into a meaningful trade-off (her pain for communal rebirth). Cost is unmistakable—"tendril collapsed, spent, into golden dust"—but the harvest moon’s role as catalyst lacks causal friction beyond timing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes declared ("fickle" starlight) but never concretely tested during ritual; third attempt succeeds without escalation. Dominant stake lacks visible price beyond physical discomfort, failing cost legibility required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (storing wonder) tightens through Elias's light studies narrowing options. Agency clear in daily observations, but keeper's off-page pressure lacks dramatized friction. Cost ("wounded season ending") visible yet slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes deepen through carving agency—"here and gone" concept transforms tactics as wood yields. Cost is unmistakable in "carry the dead forward," though escalation relies solely on textural accumulation without visible tradeoff beyond emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (negotiating with ghost) tightens credibly through camera confrontation. Cost ("I’m tired," wading away) is felt but not unmistakable—lacks visible tradeoff like discarding a vital tool during departure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens through Lila’s agency: rerouting flows transforms "stagnant" energy into luminous equation; cost legible in "raw, untested" formula that forecloses easy nostalgia for the terminal’s past.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes signaled immediately via "shackled to ticking hands"; escalation through sensory deepening (growl → song → touch) reweights silence with cost in "years" of abandoned dream, though bear's arrival edges toward coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (uncovering deception architecture) lacks tangible cost escalation; blueprint discovery deepens knowledge but no trade-offs or tactical shifts. Stakes remain intellectual despite strong early signaling of "test of his ability to see."

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through knot-decoding beats that narrow options (rope as library), culminating in conceptual cost of realizing legacy is "preservation itself." Agency drives escalation; fog-thickening raises urgency without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (mapping healing's geography) tightens through thread's fading vibration—visible cost forcing Elara's realization. Agency via projection method narrows options: "vibration faded... woman vanished" forecloses direct communion. Stakes remain visceral via "heart lighter" physicality, but external pressure lacks teeth; purely internal deepening suffices for Accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reawakening beauty) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening—pressure peaks with the egg's crack, yet no tangible cost (e.g., Corvin's sacrifice) narrows options; Mechanists remain off-page abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stake tightening through the bird rescue (agency = splinting despite pain) narrows options effectively. But the man’s dialogue about her father feels externally imposed rather than organically escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative escalation via breadcrumb density tightens options effectively, but cost remains abstract (scraped fingers minor); "defiance" motivation lacks visceral stakes until final image.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reconciling fire/light) escalates through agency-driven deepening: sonar pinging urgency forces Lumin deeper, ghost confrontation crystallizes stance. Cost visible in parents' scars and elders' rejection, narrowing options to "quiet fire" path. Pressure tightens under accumulative lens via petal/sonar cadence shifts reweighting generational patterns with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Marlow's agency under Accumulative lens: butterfly migration forces crystallization of stance. Dominant stake (unspoken grief vs tradition) tightens meaningfully—his poem reading forecloses isolation path with visible cost (emotional exposure, ribbon's fading). Coincidence (migration) complicates but doesn't resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through ridge's physical deterioration; "incremental absolution" concept drives tactics but dominant stake lacks sufficient friction between Lirael's personal cost and communal duty during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (thaw vs perpetual winter) tightens through derision at equinox prediction, with Elders' silent robes paying visible cost. Agency-driven deepening via star cross-referencing under Accumulative lens, though escalation lacks secondary pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (recovering lost stories) tighten via signal fluctuations, but escalation lacks visceral cost—pressure remains intellectual. The broadcast’s fade-out narrows options, yet the "weight of purpose" isn’t dramatized concretely; conceptual cost suffices but feels detached from her physical struggle with the dial.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes crystallize through Lira's agency: "crystallize a fleeting emotion" vs. "mirage of safety" tightens when she whispers "This is for you" to the incomplete portrait. Cost is legible in the blurring edges and gallery's exhale—art must vanish to matter, foreclosing preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stake (preserving ancient navigation) tightens through sediment digging, narrowing options to physical endurance. Cost (bleeding hands) is visible but under-explored emotionally; escalation leans textural over causal, lacking a decisive trade-off at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Clara's agency: inviting others deepens the "unlearning hatred" stake into collective action, narrowing options to "subtracting noise." Cost is unmistakable—"gathering dust since riots" and neighbors' complaints show tangible cultural erosion altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency: each pruning cut narrows options (shedding trauma for hope), with visceral cost in trembling hands and gasping at memories. Dominant stake (rewiring the plant’s essence) tightens meaningfully as alignment peaks, forcing a trade-off between preserving pain and choosing beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reigniting wonder) tightens through drone discovery and box revelation; cost legible in "collective awe" collapse, but blackout's causality relies slightly on Voss exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (understanding house-aliveness) tighten through Lira’s object arrangement, narrowing options as the air "thickens" toward sanctification. Agency is clear: her placement of the spoon triggers the glow. Cost is legible in the irreversible shift—"the bay, already quiet, became a sanctuary"—though escalation lacks one visceral pressure point beyond atmospheric thickening.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate via Mara’s agency as revelations narrow options (cure → catalyst), but "structural weakness" method lacks early setup, making pedestal break-in feel coincidental under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.2)
    Single stake ("capture texture of loss") tightens through Kael's agency: mathematical proofs → die roll → rupture, with cost ("let them be") unmistakable in the orbiting dice's unreachable dance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through Lila's agency—painting Elena's eyes from Mr. Voss's voice—narrowing options to handing over the brush. Cost is visceral (97-hour insomnia resolved by emotional satiety), though moonlight's role in "rousing" feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten through Lila's shift from narration to baking/singing, but escalation leans environmental (thaw's trickle) rather than protagonist-driven agency; cost (beekeeper's absence) is felt but not actively chosen.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven purely by Elias' agency: failed first spin forces mercury innovation, narrowing options to single decisive choice. Cost ("stone felt colder... hunger deeper") visibly alters tactics and charges final image without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via accumulating distortions (shifting shadow, moths) narrows options under Accumulative lens, but Vey’s ambiguous cost isn’t dramatized—felt consequence lingers without on-page payment, weakening final stakes legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through mallet strikes aligning with cloud shapes, but the "rogue current" backstory lacks immediate pressure; the cost of transformation (raw fingers, aching arms) isn't sufficiently leveraged during the blue hour climax.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through Lira's agency (playing whistle improvises, chipping crack) to the journal's revelation, with the city's collapse providing unmistakable physical cost that reweights the dominant "why are watchers moving" stake.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (recapturing truth before petal drop) tightens via the tunnel’s map, but Tomas’s exposition risks passive resolution; cost is conceptual (truth’s fragility) yet unmistakable in the *T*’s inscription.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency (wresting hatch open) deepens the dominant stake (validating grandmother's stories) with conceptual cost; chamber discovery reweights options under Accumulative lens, though tension slightly softens post-reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake signaled early ("understand why abandoned"), deepened through agency (indexing skills solve vault). Cost legible in "throat tightened" and journal's weight. Escalation slightly smooth—pressure could intensify faster.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (facing shadow/grief) tightens via gem's reflection and shadow's return. Agency in transformation choice ("fold this moment into a crane") forecloses avoidance path. Cost legible in "heart a knot of ache and awe" during memory cascade.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Elara's refusal to abort ("No. Keep scanning") deepens pressure under Accumulative lens, narrowing options through visceral intensification (node "screamed," "vortex expanded"). Cost is unmistakable—"observatory was gone"—reconfiguring her existence with conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Lira's agency: drone scan → lever pull narrows options meaningfully. Cost is undeniable in the physical resonance ("hum in her bones") and shattered expectation of answers. Pilgrim's exposition slightly reduces tension before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: discovering brother’s erasure via driftwood deepens the "sieved hush" from absence to active consumption; single escalation (carvings revealing truth) forecloses false-memory solution with visible cost (guilt "twisted, sharp and familiar"); pressure coherent under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation is driven by Clara’s agency—her research on the individuals narrows options toward the exchange’s success. The dominant stake (trust as razor’s edge) tightens when Elias reveals the cartographer’s innocence, making "fear is the crime" a felt conceptual cost that reconfigures prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes signaled early ("regrets had shattered" her navigation), deepening through compass reinterpretation into "tide pulling her back." One meaningful intensification: needle pointing to horizon reconfigures regret’s meaning, narrowing options to "done hiding" with visible cost—abandoning the compass. Agency-driven under accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Mara's agency as she engages the lake's reflections, crystallizing her internal conflict (erasure vs. understanding); the cost—carrying regret with "grace"—is legible in J.T.'s "holding pain" dialogue, making the escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single tightening through protagonist agency: spice-scent application triggers irreversible metamorphosis, narrowing options from refusal/compliance to transformation. Cost legible in "lose herself" realization, though dominant stake (reforging bond) lacks sufficient external counter-pressure beyond internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes tighten decisively when the saucer's crack widens, releasing light that forces Elara to climb the tree. Her agency drives escalation (unfastening the crack), with cost legible in the frayed handprint shift and fading glade, perfectly calibrated for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation driven by Lira’s agency: her choice to enter the chamber tightens options, and the locket’s dimming creates tangible cost. Shadow work mechanics lack mid-beat development (e.g., AI’s explanation feels declarative), slightly muting pressure until the stitching climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency—releasing the final bug crystallizes her stance shift from “fixing” to listening. Cost is visceral (earth’s shift) and conceptual (abandoning control), though the stranger’s prophecy exposition risks coincidence-as-resolution under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (exposing Council) escalate causally via blackout/sundial, but pressure lacks teeth—no tangible opposition or paid cost. "Test" theory remains abstract; cost feels deferred rather than unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through rock-sequence escalation (Fibonacci→Pascal→Möbius) driven by Lira's agency; visible cost in vision-fracture terror and final tears forecloses control-for-witnessing trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (censorship vs. raw truth) tightens via storm’s pressure forcing Kael’s poetic rarefaction; "furiously tranquil" crystallization shows earned trade-off. But "vigil in pause" concept remains thematic echo rather than tactical constraint until envelope reading.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: Kael’s recontextualization tightens options from victory to translation, with Elyra’s disarming forcing "evolve" over yield. Cost (blood, abandoned duel framework) visibly alters tactics. One tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Cedar’s agency (writing as rebellion), but molting’s monthly constraint isn’t leveraged for visible trade-offs beyond internal shift; cost feels conceptual not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative/Textural lens as compasses "flicker faster" and tides "hold their breath," tightening her choice to surrender strategy for raw music; cost is legible in the vibrating strings' "ghost" as she leaves the piano open.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the seed’s detachment forces Lira to choose memory over oblivion, but the "fear of truth" revelation lacks tangible escalation—pressure relies more on lyric density than character-driven narrowing.
