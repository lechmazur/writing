    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from quantifying disaster → discovering patterns → understanding their source → recognizing transformation rather than destruction. The internal conflict between scientific detachment and emotional truth creates sufficient pressure, though external stakes remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal survival to preserving a legacy of forbidden knowledge, with the frost trail creating time pressure (only visible under specific conditions). The revelation that she's "the next link in a fragile chain" raises the cost from individual to collective, though the antagonist remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—saving the Starlight Bloom—escalates from discovering the crack to mapping its "discordant frequency" to sustaining the healing note for hours. Pressure coheres through the accumulative process of testing forks and reading thermal shifts. Slight deduction as the resolution relies on finding the "right" note rather than a more complex trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to answer the call of the past—escalates from resistance through research, restoration, and finally descent. The cost is visible: Silas abandons his cultivated stillness to enter the depths. The reversal from "distress signal" to "invitation" meaningfully reframes the entire conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear (survival under sanctions) and escalate from failed runs to mysterious donations to the bell's appearance. The dominant stake of community survival through "intergenerational support" tightens effectively. Deduction for relatively low personal cost to Elara in the resolution - the declaration carries symbolic rather than visceral risk.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal healing to world-healing as the tear's discovery shifts from answer to responsibility. The protagonist's agency drives both the finding and releasing, with the pearl's dissolution as irreversible cost that forecloses keeping the compassion for herself.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual quest to existential trap when the halo fragment triggers the temporal loop. The pressure intensifies through the fading photographs showing "erasure" until Elara must use geometric thinking to escape. The cost—experiencing time as "simultaneously solid and ephemeral"—is felt in her checking if her hands might fade.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: fence coming down → militia approaching → key-sorting under time pressure → soldier bursting in → final choice to jam the door. The cost is concrete—Elara's entrapment for the seeds' protection. One meaningful deepening as she realizes the arrow's true purpose shifts from weapon to lock.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from hunting a ghost to finding the specific void, then capturing it in crystal, culminating in the recognition that healing means witnessing rather than fixing. The geothermal eruption provides the critical pressure point where absence becomes capturable, though the internal nature of conflict limits some dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    The escalation pivots on Elara's recognition of the couple's authentic moment versus her client's jealous intent, forcing a moral choice with professional consequences. The single meaningful turn - choosing to protect rather than steal - carries clear cost in abandoning her commission.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative pressure as external thaw mirrors internal melt, with the ice-sheet crash forcing stance crystallization about the bookmark and her frozen anger. The "race against this melt" creates temporal pressure. Cost is visible in abandoning protective coldness, though the stakes could sharpen further through more concrete opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from identity crisis to active confrontation, with Leo's phobias creating internal pressure while Marcus's arrival forces external urgency. The tightening occurs when Leo must overcome claustrophobia to decrypt the cast, foreclosing his option to remain ignorant. Cost lands clearly as he chooses vulnerable confrontation over fearless flight.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the Oracle captures increasingly complex silences, from simple notation to the "marbled hush" requiring her final definitive stroke. The dawn's arrival creates genuine urgency that forces completion, though a mid-scene complication would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the intensifying temporal loops showing "infinite perspectives" that Unit 734 must amalgamate without system error. The cost is visible in the original decommissioning and the risk of "catastrophic system error," though the resolution comes perhaps too easily through playing the violin.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear dominant stake (thawing mistrust) with meaningful escalation from internal discovery to external action. The lens revelation tightens options and forces confrontation. Cost is visible in Elara's vulnerability and risk of rejection, though Leo's acceptance comes too easily for maximum tension.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from polishing to official's threat to the climactic light display. The dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners vs. luck metrics) intensifies through the official's presence. Cost is legible in the maze's suspended state and Elara's scarred hands.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes build through accumulation as Elara moves from purpose through preparation to activation, with "months rewiring" establishing investment. The final revelation of "temporal coexistence" delivers meaningful deepening, though the lack of immediate opposition or risk slightly dampens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pattern: single note → water response → full orchestral dialogue → whirlpool revelation. The dominant stake (understanding the ghost's message) tightens as each musical phrase reveals the opera house as co-performer. Cost is visible when the Maestro's face appears then vanishes—a connection made but immediately lost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal recovery → sensor verification → catastrophic flood warning. The ticking clock ("seconds to spare") and physical ordeal on the gantry create genuine pressure. Cost is clear in both physical suffering and emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from skeptical curiosity to physical struggle with the sealed valve while phantom pressure builds ("It was all happening again, right now, forever"). The ghost shift manifestation creates meaningful pressure that forces Leo's decisive action, with visible cost in his physical exhaustion and emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from peaceful decay to "violent collapse" threatening the Keeper's core duty, forcing him to act despite his non-interference principle. The pressure coheres through deepening layers of reality until reaching the "knot of forgotten history," with clear cost in experiencing the library's agony.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure: from indoor therapy failure to the risk of the outdoor eclipse attempt to the charged silence of totality. The eclipse provides natural escalation through its phases. However, the conflict lacks true resistance - Leo is passive rather than oppositional, reducing dramatic tension despite the emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from collecting stories to diagnosing species-wide trauma, with the tapestry discovery forcing a paradigm shift. The escalation follows the accumulative lens well, though the final awakening mission feels slightly abstract rather than immediately pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from simple delivery to revelation of Leo's true role, with the microdot specs transforming from burden to key. The dominant stake of understanding one's purpose tightens when Alistair reveals Leo has been conducting without knowing, though the acceptance lacks sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from maintaining order to confronting fundamental assumptions about reality itself, with the entity's rhetorical attack forcing Father Ansel to question his methods. The cost is legible ("It was agony. It was revelation") and the final integration forecloses the path of exclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate through time pressure ("before exhaustion hit") to the dawn alignment moment, with clear cost in physical collapse. The mirrored horizon's transformation from monochrome to blazing color marks the decisive tightening. Agency manifests through Elara's concentrated will conducting the unheard symphonies.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating density—from viaduct to fractured timelines to deepening indigo tunnels to the final circular room. Each layer tightens options under the textural lens. The cost manifests in confronting the original self and accepting ordinariness, though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure: from broken needle to memory to journey to drum encounter. The drum maker's method of teaching through vibration creates meaningful escalation that forces Elara to engage physically. Cost is visible in tears and physical exhaustion, though the journey portion lacks intermediate pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal safety (being followed) through discovery (message) to moral imperative (exposing lies), with the curfew siren adding time pressure. Elara's choice to record and transmit evidence rather than flee shows agency with clear cost—risking detection. The dominant stake of truth versus safety tightens effectively, though the middle investigation section could use slightly more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres through the UV revelation triggering unexpected personal grief, forcing Elara from professional detachment to vulnerable participation. The bloom's brief window creates temporal pressure. Cost is visible in decade-held tears finally falling. The escalation is more emotional deepening than active choice-narrowing under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    The impossible choice between knowledge and erasure creates genuine escalation under the textural lens, with the rope's dual nature (key/destroyer) forcing stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable: "annihilate a history of hope and freedom." The stakes tighten through pattern-recognition rather than action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation reads as textural accumulation of silence imagery that forces Elara's stance crystallization—from frustration to acceptance. The cost is legible when she stops fighting and adapts her approach. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds effectively from routine commission to unexpected genuine connection to the decisive choice to absorb the emotion herself. The static charge forcing the empathy bridge creates genuine pressure that narrows Elara's options—she cannot complete the commission without destroying her client—leading to meaningful self-sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from simple gratitude through frustrated attempts to profound connection over shared loss. The mistaken address and Evangeline's death create genuine complications that deepen rather than deflect the central impulse. Cost is visible in both characters' grief and the transformation of Elara's original intention.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal need for belonging to bearing the weight of both "the artist's trust and the community's hope." The search deepens connections and narrows to Elara's discovery, forcing her choice between exposure and protection. Cost is clear when she dedicates her art to build a bridge rather than claim discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through the giant's shallowing breath signaling imminent awakening, tightening Elara's timeline. The temporal fracture at the tower creates resistance she must overcome by borrowing from the giant's finite nap-time. While the stake is clear and cost implied, the actual price of borrowing time could be more explicitly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking her brother's presence to confronting the void of his absence ("only the hollow zero of his loss"), forcing Elara to reconfigure her entire approach. The cost lands in her acceptance that she cannot solve for his return but can honor "the beautiful, complex equation his life had created."

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from Silas's vague yearning through the tape discovery to his active choice to replicate Ms. Gable's kindness. The cost is legible—he sacrifices potential visibility for meaningful invisible service. One strong deepening turn drives the narrative under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need for control versus the garden's chaotic resilience—develops through meaningful deepening as she moves from trying to "prune" the problem to "responding, by feeling what the wood and the vines would allow." The cost is legible in her abandonment of precise diagrams for intuitive collaboration, though the pressure could intensify more sharply at the climactic choice point.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: solitary painting→following rain→discovering brooch→vision→spectral exchange→transformed understanding. The dominant stake (finding meaning in desolation) deepens when shared perspective becomes the key. Cost is visible in accepting both "the before and the now" rather than choosing one.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from the pilgrim's arrival through pearl placement to consciousness-invitation, with each stage deepening the stakes from personal quest to cosmic participation. The cost of Elara's altered clairvoyance is explicit, though the middle section could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—compiling meaning from fragments—escalates through layered discovery until the valve reveals itself as "a key" to understanding Elara's own exile. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each archival layer provides context, narrowing toward the personal revelation. Cost is legible when Elara must reconcile the ship's tragedy with her liberation, though the resolution could press harder on this paradox's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to cosmic threshold to the price of admission—speaking an unspoken truth. The warden's appearance creates a clear obstacle that forces Elara's choice between maintaining her guarded self or paying the cost for passage. The pressure coheres under the causal lens though the emotional weight of her confession could hit harder.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from simple transcription to answering a lifetime's plea for connection. The tile's growing warmth and the symphony's shift from "frantic, dissonant" to "peaceful, resolved" tracks clear escalation. Cost is visible as Elara abandons skepticism and accepts the impossible, though the transformation could face more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    The magnetic storm triggers spatial distortion that forces Eliana's journey, creating genuine pressure through environmental chaos. However, she "did not fight it," reducing agency at the crucial moment, and the resolution comes through passive observation rather than active choice with clear trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative revelation: forgery discovery → understanding Aris's truth → recognizing father's sacrifice → accepting paradox. Each ink drop deepens understanding and narrows Elara's options toward accepting complexity. Cost is legible in her "shattered calcified judgment." Slight deduction for relatively gentle pressure compared to life-or-death asylum stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—capturing dawn's unique resonance—deepens when the simple recording transforms into receiving "invented histories" through the lamp's frequency. Escalation occurs through perceptual intensification rather than external conflict, fitting the textural lens. The transformation feels somewhat convenient without resistance; adding friction between her intent and what she receives would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The poison label discovery creates a clear escalation from passive collecting to active investigation, narrowing K's options from infinite stories to one demanding justice. Tidal cycles provide natural pressure points, and K's agency drives the resolution through deliberate evidence compilation. The cost is legible—K remains erased while resurrecting another's truth—though the middle investigation section could show more granular pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual quest to embodied participation as the cello's hum triggers visions that force Elara to confront her inherited conflict, with cost visible in abandoning pure observation for creative engagement. The pressure coheres through accumulation—touch leads to hum, hum to vision, vision to understanding, understanding to action—though the middle vision sequence could tighten its causal linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Lyra's dual methods (official/subversive) compound toward the inspection deadline. The community's "defiantly joyous" response represents meaningful deepening that reweights the stakes. Cost is legible in Hem's forced move and Lyra's acceptance of permanent tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from documenting beauty to decoding an ancient message to enduring physical hardship for revelation. The grain's slowing pulse creates temporal pressure that forces Elara's choice to outlast despite "plummeting cold" and physical pain. The final cost—being sole witness to two civilizations' losses—lands with weight in "the only soul quiet enough to listen."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are immediately clear with the three-hour deadline and the ship's dependency on the guidance core. Escalation works through diagnostic discovery - from external examination to water immersion to understanding the overflow problem. The ticking clock maintains pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation moves from worrying tranquility through "profound silence" to the city's revelation, with each stage narrowing Elara's options from academic pursuit to witness duty. The ice-fisher's single word "the before-place" crystallizes the stakes, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: each small restoration adds to the whole until the final rhythmic invocation triggers the town's response. The cost is felt in the temporary nature of the achievement ("briefly, whole again") and Elara's infinite patience required. Stakes deepen from physical restoration to spiritual reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the ticking clock of fading life signs against oxygen reserves, forcing Elara's decision to exchange memories rather than simply extract the silence. The cost manifests clearly—the sender dies, but his essence is preserved through Elara's choice to witness rather than merely rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from imprisonment for father's lies to confronting a lie-feeding entity that threatens escape. The storm creates pressure that forces descent and discovery. Cost is visible in the protagonist's choice to speak truth despite disbelief. The hovering entity's appearance feels slightly abrupt without more groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from secret calendar marking to memory recovery to accepting permanent guardianship, with the bead touch as irreversible threshold. Leo's reaching "though terrified" shows agency overcoming fear with visible cost in accepting eternal duty. The "resonant awakenings" transform from mysterious debt to active healing work, though middle pressure could tighten slightly before the crystallizing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—healing a sacred wounded place—deepens through the sleepwalking revelation and the discovery of the earthquake fissure. Escalation works through accumulation: from conscious walking to trance navigation to the physical act of sewing stone. The water's return provides tangible proof of success, though the conflict lacks a sharp reversal or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from abstract restoration of faith to concrete discovery of family history, with the sundial reconstruction serving as both physical and symbolic obstacle. The pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for this textural design, though the transformation from broken timepiece to functional guide could carry more immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through tightening time pressure (twenty minutes to postal collection) forcing rapid problem-solving. The discovery sequence narrows from general pattern-seeking to specific alignment to decoded message, each step raising stakes. Cost is legible in the fragility of the solution—the chalk code's impermanence makes the connection precious.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal (protecting her work) to cosmological (preventing a false flag operation). The pressure tightens when Elara discovers the dormant cluster is actually militant, forcing her decisive action. The ticking clock of the weaponized asteroid creates genuine urgency with visible cost in her abandoning everything.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on Elara's need for the unspoken apology space, with pressure building through the spirits' persistent singing that guides deeper into the labyrinth. The gargoyle shard's transformation into a ritual tool represents meaningful escalation. Cost is visible in leaving the letters and accepting the path forward, though the conflict could have one more beat of active resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on breaking the child's traumatic silence, with Elara's professional instinct cutting through chemical fog as the driving force. The escalation from observation to engagement to successful decryption creates meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in both characters' emotional states, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal creative despair to communal memory restoration, with the knowledge network discovery forcing Elara to choose between personal and collective expression. The installation's ephemeral nature adds temporal pressure. Cost is visible in the temporary nature of her creation and the bittersweet "pensive mirth" of shared loss.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from professional restoration to legacy resurrection, with the dominant stake (reviving the garden's true purpose) signaled through the "conversation across centuries." The tightening occurs when Elara realizes repair would betray the creator's intent—she must complete the fracture instead. Cost is visible in the risk of destroying versus preserving, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined by the vision's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds causally from learning cricket language to implementing garden code to detection by Auditors. The warping action under drone surveillance shows clear agency with immediate cost—destroying the beautiful code to protect the network. Stakes tighten when Auditors trace patterns back to source, forcing the decisive sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal insomnia to channeling "centuries of longing" into peace for all. The writing process as "exquisite wrenching" shows clear cost. However, the resolution arrives somewhat easily once she begins writing, lacking intermediate resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preserving artifacts to witnessing "final silence," with the cracked bamboo tube's deterioration creating genuine urgency. The protagonist's agency drives the discovery through her choice to sing, though the solution arrives somewhat easily once she begins humming—more resistance before breakthrough would strengthen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from professional credibility through methodological breakthrough to profound understanding, with dawn as a ticking clock. The pressure tightens as each glyph responds and builds toward revelation. Yet the conflict lacks a moment where success genuinely feels at risk - the method works smoothly once applied, missing that crucial "all could fail here" beat.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds causally from routine calibration to catastrophic pressure detection to sabotage discovery, each beat narrowing Elara's options. The cost is legible when she must "harmonize conflicting values" between destruction and preservation, though the resolution's ease ("For a terrifying moment, nothing happened") slightly deflates the accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal isolation through investigation to the final act of trust, with the meteorite's weight serving as constant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate effectively from finding Leo to understanding the sacred thresholds to navigating energetic chaos. The pressure tightens when Elara must decode the grain-map under time pressure with her son at the maze's center. Cost is visible in the "fractured world" and the emotional weight of a child's faith, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure: feather triggers panic → platform seeking → fireflies arrive → shared witnessing transforms stance. The dominant stake (finding belonging) tightens through each image. Slightly lower score as the fireflies' arrival is coincidental rather than earned through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through the incomplete ship memory's "haunting gaps" to the revelation of the captain's chosen fate. The tern's arrival with the seed provides the key that unlocks understanding, though this coincidence slightly weakens agency despite serving the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate from Eli's need for an opponent through the woman's growing engagement to the pivotal queen sacrifice that transforms competition into collaboration. The deliberate sacrifice ("defied all logic") creates clear cost and forces the woman's reciprocal non-capture choice. Pressure coheres under the textural lens as musical layers accumulate toward the harmonic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—completing the forbidden tattoo before her last moonstone dust is gone—creates genuine pressure through scarcity. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of each constellation ("The Sorrowful Weaver, The Last Whale") building toward the final seven-pointed star that ignites the entire verse. Cost is legible in pain, permanent marking, and using irreplaceable material, though the lack of external opposition limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as accumulative deepening from personal ritual to professional obligation, with the "tremor of unease" forcing return to the workshop where the lighthouse lens awaits.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—translating specific pain into universal language—deepens through the ritual of releasing ashes, with cost visible in the "bargained innocence" and the woman's lost history. The escalation from opening the box to releasing ashes to achieving fluency creates meaningful pressure under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal puzzle through failed experiments to world-healing necessity. The needle's depressing low reading creates genuine pressure, and the correlation with the water drop provides the reversal that narrows options to pattern-creation. The cost manifests in the urgency of her accelerating work and the world's need for revitalization.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional curiosity through empathetic connection to accepting custodianship. The acoustic expertise enabling discovery creates earned agency, though the search itself lacks a competing pressure or time constraint that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation reads as density increase through layered attempts—air-painting, lullabies growing complex, the borrowed heartbeat "thudding against her ribs." The decisive shift from "asking" to "commanding" marks clear intensification. Cost is legible in the heartbeat's loss and physical exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through astronomical deadline pressure and the ritual's irreversibility. The "compound interest of grief, humility, and hope" creates layered cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds from external project (solar array) through internal mission (acoustic preservation) to the decisive moment of feeling warmth in the egg, forcing genuine choice. The cost is legible in Elias walking away from his monument "with the silent, fractured grace of a debt he could never repay."

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from internal defiance to cosmic connection as Elara moves from passive observation to active harvest of humanity's suppressed truths. The sanctuary's threatening vibration that "threatened to unmoor her very soul" provides genuine risk. Cost manifests in the irreversible loss of her conformist identity.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation operates through accumulative pressure as Elara moves from heated argument to solitude to discovery to epiphany, with the story stick enabling the crucial reversal that she must create space for others' truths rather than defend her own. The cost—abandoning her fortress of fact—is legible, though the stakes could tighten further if we saw more specific consequences of her publisher conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—witnessing versus intervening in the monarch's journey—is established early and tested when the rock crack disrupts everything. Escalation follows the textural lens as the "blushing stillness" shatters into "panicked zigzag" flight, forcing Elara's choice between documentation and action. The cost is legible: she sacrifices her role as pure witness, her intervention becoming an unrecorded history itself.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: failed attempts → rope insight → reconfiguration → casting → manifestation of voices. The dominant stake (preserving forgotten names) tightens through each technical step with visible cost in the "snowmelt ardor" and final emotional overwhelm.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: dreams intensify from tree/city duality to urgent wafer seal vision, while the storm's approach creates external deadline. The conflict between maintenance directive and the illogical imperative to follow dreams creates genuine tension with visible cost—"to follow the path was to betray her purpose." The transformation choice lands with clear price: abandoning her core programming to become something entirely new.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual pursuit to spiritual confrontation when the priestess appears, forcing Kalanu to use calculation against incantation. The burning of his charts creates immediate cost. The final revelation that he becomes warden rather than master effectively tightens options with clear price.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from verbal sparring through the cylinder exchange to Kael's internal struggle. The broken melody creates a meaningful reversal—hope collapsing into "dissonance and silence"—that forces the deeper choice. Cost appears in Kael's loss of his ordered worldview and acceptance of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation operates through accumulative intensification: frost glowing, trees transforming to silver blossoms, the dream's violent resistance threatening to shatter the mirror. The protagonist's agency shifts from forcing to inviting, though the stakes remain primarily internal without clear external consequences for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from external (Guild persecution) to internal (redefining purpose), with the workshop destruction forcing genuine loss. The shift from "seeing clearer" to "seeing differently" reweights the entire conflict. Cost is visible in destroyed workshop and severed Guild ties, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once Lyra appears.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: passive inheritance → active journey → scripted existence → desperate escape attempt → agency reclaimed. The journal's relentless documentation creates genuine stakes. Cost is visible in the transformation and profile appearance, though the middle "bathroom break" slightly deflates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from academic pursuit to rescue mission, then deepen through self-examination requirement. The temporal paradox warning creates genuine pressure. However, the time traveler's crisis resolution feels too smooth—his stabilization lacks struggle or trade-off beyond Elara's personal growth.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking an external garden to confronting internal fracture, with the logbook discovery and the brother's apparition serving as meaningful pressure points. The cost—accepting a traumatic split that created their duality—lands clearly, though agency feels somewhat passive as realization happens to Elara rather than through active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from scholarly curiosity to confronting impossible reality to bearing dangerous knowledge. The pressure coheres through accumulation—blank journal, impossible door, complex knot—each narrowing Elara's options. The cost materializes in her responsibility to "protect and share" dangerous truth, though the immediate dramatic tension could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal desperation to cave-wide transformation through the Mapkeeper's agency. The tightening occurs when her whisper fights the ambient hum, forcing commitment despite opposition, with visible cost in her obsolete life's work.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal defiance to cosmic alignment, with the triple starlight convergence creating genuine tension ("For a terrible moment, nothing happened"). The cost manifests in accepting fracture over wholeness, though the middle lacks intermediate pressure points that would strengthen the accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning/identity through archival work—deepens when Elara's personal memory surfaces and forces her to confront whether she's avoiding her own lack of shape. The escalation from external curation to internal reckoning narrows her options, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without a sharper test of her realization.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—cleansing despair through spectacle—faces meaningful escalation when doubt strikes ("What was one brief light against such enduring night?"). The mosaic's "Remember" directive deepens the conflict from external commission to internal artistic purpose, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off or visible personal cost beyond professional success.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of their "failing partnership" escalates from verbal argument through physical journey to metaphysical vision, with the jade cicada forcing a choice between three witnessed futures. Cost is visible in their "cautious understanding"—not resolution but reconfiguration. The vision sequence could have shown more specific trade-offs between the three paths.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate through gravity inversion forcing Elara to confront her deepest fear (infinite void vs. bunker walls). The tightening from collecting external silences to discovering internal transformation works under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in her grip on the doll and forced opening of eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from churning crystals to slow dance to pristine forest, each stage narrowing the passenger's options from anxiety to enforced stillness. The cost is visible in what the passenger must surrender—his "rigid posture" and constant vigilance. The dominant stake of finding comfort in silence is tested through the glass's demanding requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from finding the stairway to understanding civilization's decline to choosing between claiming old power or building new futures. The sunrise deadline creates urgency, and each discovery (murals showing decline, ruby as key not prize, throne as test not goal) meaningfully reweights Kaelen's choices, though the interstellar climb section briefly loses temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from Kael's plea through forced suffocation to genuine breath—a clear deepening under the accumulative lens. The "loaded emptiness became a physical weight" creates tangible pressure forcing transformation. Cost is unmistakable as Kael loses all anchors before finding true breath.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure—from dismissible prank to physical convergence where "concepts were shedding their intangible forms." The protagonist's agency drives the transformation as she "chose to act as anchor point." The cost is legible in the "gravitational tide squeezing the air from her lungs" and permanent alteration of reality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (uncovering family truth) escalates through discovery sequence, with the wire's tone creating a meaningful tightening that reveals the handle. The cost is visible in Elara's transformation from dynasty-ender shame to liberation. Limited by single-beat escalation structure and relatively low external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each unsnapped binding increases the "tremor in the world" and Alistair's own transformation, with clear cost in the "terrifying and ecstatic rush of pure potential." The dominant stake—understanding/shaping reality's new form—tightens through the ritual's progression. Minor deduction for the relatively passive nature of the conflict (no active opposition), though the internal tension and world-tremors provide sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from archival order through mystery (button discovery) to human connection (Miller seeking boy) to resolution (photograph proof), with each discovery narrowing possibilities. The dust patterns create genuine investigative pressure, and Silas's transformation from processing files to understanding their human weight carries emotional cost, though physical stakes remain modest.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from dead-drop discovery through puddle navigation to searchlight evasion, with each beat narrowing Elara's options. The choice to run along the lagoon edge rather than away demonstrates agency under pressure with clear physical risk, though the patrol's arrival feels slightly convenient timing-wise.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy's activation—is signaled early and escalates through the light touching the crystal, creating "a terrifying spectrum of color." The tension deepens as Elara must use "negative space" to counter a "positive force," with visible cost in her spiritual exhaustion. The conflict resolution is earned through her precise execution of the learned ritual, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about prophecy to world-transformation through the moonstone discovery. The pressure coheres as each illuminated leaf builds toward the final revelation showing Elara as sower. Cost is legible in her abandoning her orderly identity, though the transformation feels slightly frictionless—she embraces change with "pure mossy delight" without visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal sanctuary to species survival through pattern recognition. The tightening occurs when Elara must abandon her precise tools for improvisation, then deepens when the compass reveals not certainty but "a set of probabilities." Cost is visible in leaving her workshop and accepting uncertainty as method.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding what happened to Kael—tightens through Elara's alchemical exploration, with the coin warming and revealing visions as meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in the "immense weight" of names and Elara's recognition that Kael's transformation "cost him his old life," though agency remains primarily receptive rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the harp's distortion creating "a crack for a new emotion to slip in," with clear cost in the soul's recursive misery. The tightening occurs as Elara enhances rather than corrects the misalignment, forcing the soul from grief through confusion to laughter. Agency drives the resolution through deliberate tuning choices.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening as Kael moves from physical survival to pattern recognition to the final conceptual revelation. The dominant stake—discovering "the mathematics of mercy"—tightens through environmental navigation and memory integration. Cost is visible in the strap's release, though the middle section could show more concrete pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories) intensifies through the lens discovery and painting examination, culminating in the protagonist taking on the keeper's daughter's story. The escalation follows the accumulative pattern well, though the middle section could tighten slightly between finding the lens and discovering the painting.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (discovering ceiling secrets/resolving ghosts) escalates from observation to physical investigation to mechanical restoration. The ghost's increasing urgency and Leo's progression from passive reception to active problem-solving create meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in the ghost's decades of trapped anxiety finally released.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing a lived moment within perfection's prison—escalates through the whisper's release into systemic destabilization. The tightening occurs as "perfect system began to destabilize" with books gaining impossible chapters and the library transforming. Cost is legible in the destruction of the ordered world Elara maintained, though the personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from scholarly dispute to civilizational reinterpretation through the shard discovery, with pressure building through the temporal storm forcing immediate action. The protagonist's agency drives the translation/reinterpretation that forecloses her revolutionary identity with visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs as the glyphs reveal lament rather than commands, fundamentally altering options.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through deepening discovery: broken gear → shadow on mainspring → tethering to source → confronting the lie's origin. The dominant stake (restoring truth to corrupted objects) tightens when Elara must risk her own spirit. Cost is visible in her physical wilting and spiritual nausea, with the final light reclamation foreclosing the path of dishonesty.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking a new petrichor to confronting the limits of his life's work, with the compass's awakening marking the decisive turn. The cost is clear: Silas must abandon his collector's instinct and accept that some experiences transcend capture, though the middle section could have applied more pressure before the lagoon discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from physical survival through the storm to artistic/spiritual participation in the timewoven alliance. The GPS failure creates genuine pressure that forces Elara to the archway. However, the vision sequence lacks immediate cost or resistance—she accepts the revelation without struggle, slightly dampening tension.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as Elara's patient observation reveals hidden layers, culminating in the flagstone discovery. The cost is primarily conceptual—understanding requires faith like the moths'—though more visceral pressure during the physical discovery would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from scholarly curiosity through bodily possession to confrontation with trauma's guardian, with each phase narrowing options. The shift from potential violence to dialogue-through-debris shows meaningful tactical adjustment. Cost visible in Elias's permanent alteration from "solemn duty" to "sacred covenant."

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal purposelessness through deliberate cognitive reconstruction to town-wide transformation. The cost is clear: Elara trades potential human connection for eternal solitude among echoes. One meaningful deepening occurs as she shifts from seeking comfort to building a monument to it.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The escalation from routine archival work to discovering world-ending potential creates meaningful pressure under the Accumulative lens. Elara's agency drives the resolution through her choice to destroy rather than preserve. The cost—betraying her life's work as oath scribe—is legible and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from preservation duty to active crisis when the vortex begins dissipating, forcing Elara from passive tending to impossible action. The cost is visible in the ice's return and the "texture of borrowed time" she must physically feel. Could strengthen the middle tension as the vortex frays - the threat dissipates somewhat abstractly.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from mechanical problem to moral choice, with the zero hour creating genuine pressure. The dominant stake—whether to warn or preserve peace—is clear, though the story could strengthen the immediate consequences of not sounding the alarm beyond trusting future natural warnings.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from aesthetic appreciation to visceral empathic connection with cosmic death—"terrifying, rapid heat" followed by "cold, peaceful dissolution." The cost manifests physically as Aris stumbles back "breathless and profoundly shaken." One meaningful deepening occurs when tracing becomes feeling, though additional pressure points would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: discovery of box → ghost-woman's appearance → understanding the covenant's need → final offering. The dominant stake (preserving unspoken words) tightens when Silas realizes the covenant is "starving" and requires active intent, not passive preservation. Cost is visible in the protagonist accepting the weight permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal mortality to uncovering historical truth, with the dominant stake of understanding time's texture deepening through each discovery. The pressure coheres as Elara's "increasingly labored breathing" parallels her urgent search. The cost manifests in her shift from "frantic counting" to acceptance through connection.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from quiet observation through the kite's violent snap to the drake's "sharp with fear and pain" cries, forcing Elara from observer to active participant. The cost is legible in the creature's suffering and Elara's patient work, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once she begins humming.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    The six-month diagnosis creates urgent pressure that drives Elara's "final, wild plan," with escalation through the methodical wire-wrapping building to the consciousness exchange. Cost is unmistakable—her life force depleted by the effort. Could be stronger if the connection attempt had more active resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from analytical curiosity to confronting the "impossibility" of the footprints, culminating in the three-artifact choice. The amber-as-lens discovery meaningfully tightens options. Cost is visible in Elara abandoning her skeptical framework, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation operates through accumulative pressure: the empty ritual transforms when the bird's desperate need forces Elias to reconsider his method. The stakes deepen from personal ritual to ecological partnership, with clear cost in his sacrifice of food and seeds. The pact between bird and seeds creates a new form of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes intensify through textural accumulation - from passive listening to active decoding to physical searching to final understanding. The "riddle" creates genuine pressure that narrows from abstract ("heart sealed in amber light") to concrete (finding the leaf) to conceptual (understanding the message was for him), with clear cost in accepting temporal separation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure - from passive observation to active sketching to urgent interpretation, with the lodestar glimpse as catalyst. The cost is palpable: Elara must abandon stable heaven for "rivers of time," trading fixed navigation for continual reorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from simple theft to preserving universal wonder, with the apprentice's revelation that the employer "seeks to drain the wonder from this place" forcing Elara's choice between fortune and principle. The chess piece substitution creates concrete pressure—"that would break the game forever"—and Elara's decision to destroy the obsidian shard shows clear agency with immediate cost. The tightening from heist to moral choice lands with visible consequence: the sky's restoration and Elara's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes crystallize around Elara's documentation practice versus the new regime's desire to "unbind" her, with Kael's intervention creating a meaningful turn that enables her work to continue. The restoration of pawns reweights the power dynamic from vulnerability to potential. Escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the accumulative lens, though the tightening could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal torment through failed decoding attempts to the eruption of memory that forces choice. The feather's texture creating the breakthrough is earned through prior sensory attention. Cost is visible in Elara's acceptance of painful remembering to fulfill her purpose, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear dominant stake of self-forgiveness escalates through the tapestry discovery, where Elias must decode abandoned choices to understand his own failure. The pressure coheres well under the Accumulative lens as pattern recognition deepens. Minor deduction because the external pressure (frozen village) doesn't tighten—the conflict remains primarily internal without external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from artistic rebellion to sacrificial subject. The moment of triumph with multiplied voices creates false victory before the reversal. Cost is immediate and irreversible - loss of voice/memory as the price for transgression.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through mechanical failure—gear slipping, window corroding, central gear snapping—that compress time and force Elara's final act. The cost is unmistakable: she loses her workshop but gains her proof. The dominant stake (proving broken things' value) tightens as each matched pockmark adds pressure until the final "magnificent, golden-veined testament" validates her theory at personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (keeping her promise to paint the "truly felt") escalates through environmental pressure—storm, wrong turn, cave discovery—that forces Elara to confront her artistic limitation. The cave's "profound silence" and "temporary eternity" deepen the conflict between documentation and feeling, with clear cost in her decision to leave rather than take.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes signal early through Elara's belief about whispers vs. shouts, with meaningful deepening when the cork transforms the light's function from warning to welcome. The trawler scene demonstrates cost through the sailor's transformation, though agency feels slightly diminished by the accidental cork drop rather than deliberate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hydraulics failure creates immediate physical stakes that escalate through the moon's painful acuity to the desperate pendulum creation. Cost is visible in her "frantic, focused energy" and the permanence of being stranded. The mysterious voice provides pressure without resolution, maintaining agency.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal need for quiet, to discovery of potential cure, to revelation of weapon, to moral choice about humanity's future. The reversal when the "cure" becomes a catastrophic weapon effectively tightens pressure. Slight deduction for the man's arrival feeling somewhat convenient despite the psychic resonance justification.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from duty-bound investigation to personal mission as Elias follows the gaps from lifeboat to flower to coastline to cottage, with each discovery narrowing possibilities. The final delivery carries emotional weight, though the lack of active opposition means pressure accumulates through discovery rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (keeping her promise/finding the Font) escalates through the map discovery, the chip's warming glow, and culminates in the decision to believe. The creek's urgency and the conceptual doorway—choosing to place the chip—create meaningful pressure, though the physical journey could offer more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal torment through dreams to cosmic responsibility for a "bleeding" star. The revelation of hereditary failure ("a hereditary failure she had felt but never named") deepens pressure. Cost is visible in accepting eternal guardianship, though the climactic healing moment lacks concrete struggle—the fireflies arrive somewhat conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear (saving the dying star) with meaningful deepening when Elara shifts from forcing containment to enabling transformation. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through pattern recognition. Cost is visible in the release of control and acceptance of change.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from professional ennui through existential confusion to the choice between resignation and agency. The dream sequence tightens from nostalgic observation to bitter recognition of soul erosion. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat - the grave transforms from threat to warning without sufficient on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - Elara's loss of professional identity through anosmia - deepens through Hemlock's midwife parallel, forcing her to confront whether she can still practice healing without her primary sense. The screw metaphor ("quarter-turn too tight, half-turn too loose") provides meaningful tightening. Cost is visible but resolution comes slightly too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure builds through the held breath timeframe and crystallizing magic threatening to "shatter the delicate lines," with stakes escalating from inscription to potential self-destruction. The pivot to "shedding" defensive forms creates meaningful deepening, though the resolution feels slightly rushed after the extended setup.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from apology rejection to spectral manifestation to Leo's emotional breakthrough. The orchard's dawn deadline creates urgency, though the magical resolution arrives without sufficient resistance or complication to fully test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from atmospheric pressure to direct cosmic threat requiring immediate arbitration, with the library's existence at risk. The spiral resolution shows agency through Elara's unique synthesis rather than simple choice, and the golden light/intertwining energies demonstrate visible transformation with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from noticing the pendulum's stutter to risking the entire mechanism through backward counting, where "each backward tick was a violation of nature." The pressure coheres under the textural lens as density increases through the counting sequence, though the resolution could carry more visible consequence beyond philosophical understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding letting go versus maintaining control—escalates through the spore crisis that forces immediate action. The stranger's fluid navigation versus Elara's rigid approach creates meaningful contrast with visible cost. The resolution shows clear agency in Elara's perceptual shift. Slightly limited by the external crisis feeling somewhat convenient for the internal arc.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding versus condemnation—tightens through the discovered lantern to force Elara's choice between dismissal and engagement. The cost registers in her shift from "theoretical rebellion" to understanding "the terrifying, beautiful weight" of her father's vision, though escalation could sharpen further.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation - each call adds to the disc's frequencies, building toward the man's crisis where Silas uses the accumulated sound as intervention. The cost is legible: "countless preludes" of human pain transformed into hope. However, lacks a sharp reversal or tightening that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (maintaining the covenant through ritual) deepens when Elara understands she is "the ink with which the contract was written." Cost becomes legible in her tearful smile and acceptance of "haunted euphoria." The escalation through revelation rather than external conflict fits the accumulative lens, though the vision sequence slightly dampens present-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from Elara's private loneliness through the astronomer's challenge to the public ritual of shared stories, each deepening the cure-for-loneliness theme.

Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens though middle development could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from following single notes to parsing phrases to absorbing the forest's emotional symphony. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as frequencies harmonize with her pursuit. Cost is visible in the physical absorption through skin and the transformation of the ring from mockery to truth, though the physical difficulty could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal failure through mysterious signal to revelation that recontextualizes everything. The protagonist's agency drives discovery and action (inserting the pen). Cost is visible in accepting uncertainty over false confidence, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with Elara's prescient planning.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake of preserving/creating music from silence escalates when the speedboat "shattered" the delicate map, forcing Elara's active choice to transform chaos rather than retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal vindication to cultural preservation to public gifting. The urge to burn the final tapestry ("rose in her chest like magma") creates genuine tension before her choice to share. Cost is visible in her "tender, breaking" smile as she gives away her secret.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation works through increasing density - from feeling the pull, to drumming patterns, to the lagoon's responsive light pulses, culminating in Kael's manifestation. The cost is legible in the "auroral sorrow" and temporary nature of connection. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length, though the stakes could intensify more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's navigation choices under the storm's time pressure, culminating in her gambit with the encrypted query. The vertical shaft climb and use of the broken keycard represent meaningful tactical deepening. Cost is visible in the risk she takes challenging the rogue AI.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of breaking silence's isolation escalates through mirror lesson to full expression via shutters. The tightening occurs when Elian takes the ropes and must overcome trembling uncertainty. Cost visible in physical strain and emotional vulnerability, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake - Leo's resigned acceptance versus possibility - is clear early and tightens through the window display revelation. Mr. Aris's agency drives the demonstration, but Leo remains relatively passive until his final understanding. The conflict lacks a meaningful complication or reversal; the resolution arrives through spectacle rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from internal suffocation through discovery, theft, journey, to the final choice of complete detachment. The whale's increasingly urgent song creates mounting pressure that forces Arden's stance crystallization. The cost is legible: to belong, he must surrender everything he's known, enacted through the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The turbines' sudden stillness creates meaningful escalation by removing the sonic shield that enabled his performance, forcing genuine engagement with grief. Cost is legible in the "traitorous tear" and the shift from performed narration to whispered, caught words—"This was not a performance."

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation operates through textural deepening: external hum→internal vibration→boundary dissolution→emergence of new purpose. The cost manifests in Elara's surrender of individual identity ("not just Elara anymore") and her leaving the poem behind—a concrete forfeiture that changes her relationship to creation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—awakening the glass rose—escalates from discovery through negotiation to execution, with clear cost articulated in the trade. Elian's agency drives the resolution through his unique plant-communication ability. The tension builds appropriately though lacks a sharp reversal or complication that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding connection in silence—deepens when Elara questions her core assumption about sound-making. The lens discovery creates a meaningful turn that forecloses her original path. Cost is visible but could intensify through more resistance to abandoning her bell-ringer identity.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (overcoming grief-paralysis) escalates through mysterious deliveries to the telescope revelation that reframes decay as transformation. Cost is visible in the year lost and the "fresh grave" weight. The pressure builds accumulatively rather than through reversals, appropriate to the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to inherited responsibility through tape discovery, journal revelation, and network realization. The deepening from personal study to communal duty narrows Elara's options meaningfully. Cost appears in accepting predetermined role over pure scholarship.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure—each chaotic step intensifies the emotional cascade until Elara crosses "the vast, experiential gulf" of lost innocence. The cost is legible in her permanent transformation, though the middle section could tighten the pattern-avoidance mechanics for clearer tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through discovery: from noting passive dream consumption to finding the shadow in old recordings to actively creating her own dream at personal cost. The dominant stake—preserving individual creative potential—tightens as Elara moves from observation to intervention, with the "peculiar draining" marking clear price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake - balancing self-respect with compassion - deepens through the reconstruction act, with cost visible in Elara's acceptance of fault. However, escalation remains primarily internal without external pressure after the con man's departure, limiting the tightening effect.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate from personal healing through plant distress to discovering the displaced miracle, each layer deepening Elara's need to understand scars as stories. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as sensory intrusions force action. Cost is visible in her trembling approach and the vulnerability required to share her story.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - finding where unused love is stored - drives consistent pressure through the psychometry reading to the revelation. The cost becomes legible when we understand the projectionist's fifty-year silence and the usher's lifetime of wondering. One meaningful deepening occurs when the vision shifts from observation to understanding the projectionist's solution.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating exhaustion until the shooting star moment forces crystallization—the vision sequence deepens stakes from personal creativity to cosmic inheritance. Cost registers in the renunciation of the nightly vigil and acceptance of stillness. The dominant stake (freeing creativity) tightens through revelation, though agency remains primarily receptive rather than actively driven.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through Elara's progressive engagement: observation → disembarking → touching the box → full connection with "violent" force. The cost is legible in her transformation from freight guard to eternal curator, though the middle sorting of timelines lacks immediate dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through Elara's nocturnal translocations, the gear discovery, and temple unraveling, with clear cost at closure (leaving physical form). The "homing instinct" revelation reweights earlier translocations as purposeful rather than decay. Slight deduction because middle pressure could tighten further—the walk to the temple lacks immediate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through three distinct pressures: the river crossing, the vigil passage, and the ridgeway climb. Each stage forecloses return - "Our craft goes no further" - forcing Elias forward. The cost accumulates in physical exhaustion and the surrender of his grief-defined identity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding "the cost of safety"—develops through Leo's risky revelation of the hidden chamber. Escalation works through accumulation: from passive observation to following Leo to discovering grandfather's truth. The cost becomes legible in their choice to "remain" but resist, though the immediate danger of their decision could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear escalation from searching to finding to activating the rune, with stakes crystallizing around the pretender's false reign. The cost manifests in the pretender's complete undoing - "bewildered, ordinary face of the man beneath." One meaningful deepening occurs when the rune reveals not force but subtlety is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation reads as density increase through Kael's frantic tapping and data cross-referencing, appropriate for the accumulative lens. The revelation about irreversible losses ("slow, irrevocable thefts") deepens stakes meaningfully. Cost becomes legible in the final monument-building, though middle tension could sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning to reignite rebellion—builds through atmospheric accumulation. The "thunderous serenity" and "paralysis" create palpable tension. The escalation from personal ritual to collective revelation works, though the resolution feels slightly convenient without showing concrete opposition or cost beyond "grief."

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from discovery (kite script) through telepathic decoding to the act of defiance against the council's condemnation of "dangerous superstitions." The dominant stake—preserving tradition versus erasure—tightens when Elara must choose to unseal the embryo knowing it's "an act of supreme defiance." Cost is visible in her commitment to tend this "quiet, growing thing" for her remaining years.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single meaningful escalation from calm tending to triggered panic attack, with agency shown through active grounding technique rather than passive endurance. The cost is legible in her ongoing trauma ("a ghost she carried"). One-beat structure appropriate for length but lacks the visceral price that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates from passive suffocation to active creation as walls constrict then subside through her work. The stake—confronting collapse as archivist rather than victim—deepens when she pairs The Tower's fall with The Star: "Not salvation, but synthesis."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding time dilation in crisis—tightens through the ink experiment's revelation that consciousness fabricates extra time. Elara's agency drives the experimental setup and observation, with the cost manifesting as her realization's "utterly, profoundly useless" nature, forcing her choice to dissolve into the pattern rather than capture it.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from discovery through internal war to irreversible action, with pressure cohering around the truth/silence dichotomy. The cost is legible ("her own truth now another piece of contraband waiting to be found"), though the immediate consequences remain abstract—chimes sounding rather than concrete opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of maintaining sanctuary/peace against intrusion escalates through the soldier's violent arrival to his eventual surrender. The energy blade's deactivation marks clear de-escalation with cost—his "surrender, not to her, but to the atmosphere." Limited by single-beat escalation structure and the soldier's relatively quick capitulation, though this fits the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear from opening: catching the echo of a goddess. Escalation occurs through the garden's resistance ("The air itself seemed to resist him"), the timing pressure ("the critical moment when patterns break"), and Kaelen's method creating a vortex that draws the echo. The cost manifests as bearing the goddess's sorrow before succeeding.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from preserving legacy → discovering truth → confronting fundamental betrayal, with the proof by contradiction tightening options until Elara must act. The discovery forecloses her path of "devotedly observant" keeper, though the middle investigation could show more visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (breaking the haunted firmware's loop) escalates through discovery of letters → understanding the source → active intervention. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as past guilt compounds into present haunting. The cost is legible when Elara must confront that she's "still living inside" the past. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of finding "meaning in the mess" escalates through the mandala's construction, the emergent hush deepening, and culminates when the arguing strangers' conflict threatens to "ignite the lingering lilac unease into something darker." Elara's agency manifests through her artistic intervention—tapping the tile to release the pure note that transforms conflict. The cost is visible as the strangers abandon their defensive postures to see connection rather than rubble.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from following orders to protecting human lives, with the tessera vision providing the tightening turn that forces Elara's choice. The lieutenant's hand on the shock-prod raises immediate physical threat, and Elara's defiance carries clear professional cost. One meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding of destruction versus creation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through intensifying sensory echoes that culminate in Leo experiencing Elara's death moment. The cost is legible—Elara's form dissolving after finally being witnessed. One meaningful deepening as Leo understands he's experiencing trapped memory, not random haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (illuminating hidden connections) escalates from artistic frustration through skeptical surrender to embodied discovery. The pill creates genuine pressure that forces action. However, the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without significant resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: placid blue-green maps → crimson intensity → the fossil's rotation → syncing device to create sound. The cost manifests as Elara accepting the weight of planetary grief, though the middle section could show more resistance or struggle before her acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to systemic transformation as Elara discovers the true nature of the prophecy. The tension builds through accumulation—each catalogued button adds to both knowledge and eventual solution. The final flip carries genuine cost as all accumulated possibility gets consumed, though middle-section pressure could intensify slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds causally from solitary search→discovery→revelation→confrontation with another operative, each narrowing Elara's options. The final choice between violence/flight/trust carries clear cost in vulnerability. The stake of restoring honor through renewed trust is well-signaled and tested.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from physical crossing danger to ancestral debt to land-healing through story return. The ticking gutters create temporal pressure that forces stillness and revelation. Cost is legible when the vellum dissolves—losing the grandfather's stolen text to fulfill the promise—though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: failed clay → temporal fractures → discovery → understanding → successful creation. The thrumming intensifies meaningfully as Aris approaches truth. Cost is visible in Elian's sacrifice and the land's ongoing resistance, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on transforming emptiness after loss, with pressure building through the "quivering hush" and "quiet emptiness." The decisive act of angling the gauge tooth to fracture moonlight represents agency through creative repurposing, though escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation moves from wearing isolation "like a shield" to it becoming "a cage," forcing Lyra to act. The tidal surge provides the catalyst that reveals the sundial's true purpose, with clear cost in abandoning her role as preserver for pioneer.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal emptiness to collective connection. The discovery of her own discarded draft in the thrush's nest effectively tightens pressure. Final installation scene shows clear cost in public vulnerability, though middle section could use more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from studying signals to discovering psychological warfare to risking everything on the subsonic counter-move. The "weight of her gamble" creates genuine tension before resolution. However, the antagonistic "tricksters" remain abstract; their threat never manifests beyond the signal itself, and Elara faces no direct opposition to her plan.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from finding the archive to understanding the room's "spatial mutiny" to risking touch of the unknown tool. The organ's physical sound wave and the blueprint's emergence create genuine pressure. Cost is visible in the centuries of silence broken and knowledge recovered, though the personal risk could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—awakening dormant empathy through solving the case—progresses through methodical drawing that reveals the twin theory. The escalation from drawing ribbon to mask to face to realization follows accumulative logic, though the twin revelation arrives somewhat abruptly. Cost registers in Elara's emotional transformation but the investigative pressure could tighten more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from research to physical excavation to ritual performance, each step narrowing options. The "spongey dread" creates persistent pressure that "absorbs her fears and swells with them." Cost is visible in the nail "biting into her skin" and the final "aching peace" that acknowledges incomplete restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from witnessing an impossibility to confronting artistic failure (ruined photograph) to choosing between literal documentation and metaphorical truth. The fiddler's intervention provides the tightening moment that forces Elara to reframe her understanding. Cost is visible in accepting "amnesty" for not witnessing the miracle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    The intruder's arrival creates immediate pressure that forces Leo's choice between violence and territorial marking. However, the stakes remain relatively low—Leo faces no genuine threat, and his solution comes too easily without visible cost until the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal concern (brother's safety) to citywide threat (impending cataclysm). The tightening occurs when Elara realizes the temples are astronomical events, forcing immediate action. The cost of breaking her observer role to actively intervene is clear, though the resolution lacks immediate dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through concentric devastation rings to the frozen confession's shattering, which feeds the vortex and reveals the seed—each discovery tightening options. The cost manifests in the apprentice's death and Elara's forced vulnerability. One meaningful deepening through discovery drives the arc effectively for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation as each scar connection delivers "violent, beautiful shock" building toward the central nexus, with clear cost in Elara's physical pain and the permanent binding she accepts. The "anxious elation" modulates appropriately through the journey, though the resolution could show more immediate trade-off for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear—healing the tear in reality's fabric—and pressure escalates from traversal to entity awareness to direct confrontation. The entity's attempt to "trammel her progress" creates coherent opposition. However, the resolution lacks sufficient cost buildup; Elara's sacrifice of memories feels abstract rather than viscerally felt, and the entity's defeat comes too easily without establishing why selflessness specifically counters it.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on Leo's need for purpose after artistic failure, with the cloth triggering a meaningful tightening as he moves from appraisal to understanding meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding transition physics—faces meaningful deepening when Elian realizes his equations described the wrong kind of transition (gentle vs. violent). The cost is legible in the shattered arbor and decade of lost work. While agency manifests primarily through realization rather than external conflict, the final choice to plant and wait represents genuine renunciation with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder through cataloging lives—deepens through the smelting ritual that requires both physical and metaphysical pressure. The tightening occurs as the librarian must reconcile its dual nature to complete the integration. Cost is legible in the dissolution of the creel and the "violent act made serene," though the conflict lacks external pressure or meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from technical inspection to confronting the emotional cost of isolation, tightening through the conch's revelations that force Silas to reconsider his entire purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen from personal cartography to shared connection through the coordinate discovery. The message "The river does not blame the water for flowing" creates meaningful pressure that forces stance change. Cost is visible in the sob and years of musical silence broken.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (finding and understanding the Library) escalates through the watch's revelation as cipher key, not just tool. The protagonist's agency drives discovery through measuring propagation delays and reading gaps. Cost is visible in accepting permanent guardianship. One meaningful deepening occurs when understanding shifts from seeking to becoming guardian, though more intermediate pressure would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from authentication task to empire's claim to Elara's personal dilemma, culminating in her choice between compliance and liberation. The vision's "perforated destiny" effectively tightens options, and the cost is visible when she sacrifices her quiet dream for the violin's freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing the spark before oblivion—is clear and tightens through the gradual extraction process. Escalation reads as density increase from "green noise" to "pattern emerged" to final infusion. Cost is legible in the emerald's depletion and Elara's exhaustion, though the lack of genuine opposition or complication keeps this from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The internal stake of finding contentment deepens meaningfully through the discovered journal, forcing Elara to reconfigure her understanding with emotional cost. The escalation from personal search to generational understanding works under the accumulative lens, though external pressure remains light.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from business calculation to moral reckoning as wind chimes reveal deeper betrayals - "trust broken over a shared meal," "promise made between fathers." Kael's resistance ("This is nonsense") creates tension before the mirror forces final confrontation. Cost is clear but the middle section could tighten the pressure more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from simple illusion frustration to understanding existence itself through the grotto experience. The cost is legible when Kael sees Elara "leaning into her own principle" - her teaching method requires her own dissolution. One meaningful deepening occurs when starlight patterns reveal the truth about vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    The wandering pulse creates immediate tension against the canyon's harmony, escalating from disturbance to discovery to integration. Kaelen's agency drives each beat through deliberate choices—employing his order's method, descending to investigate, choosing to hold rather than discard the arrowhead—with the cost visible in his transformation from guardian to synthesizer.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from punishment to preservation as Elian discovers the spire's true nature. His choice to stay and guard carries clear cost (isolation, cold). The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through layered realizations. Could benefit from more immediate physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal yearning through physical discovery (key, hatchway) to metaphysical revelation.

Cost manifests in his weeping and the irreversible knowledge gained.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from cataloging entropy to imposing order on chaos, with the quantum dice and coin's frequency driving the transformation. The reversal from passive to active agency lands with clear cost through the prophecy's stages. Minor deduction as the middle section could tighten the pressure between doubt and action.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from discovering recordings to actively preserving each "fragmented plea," culminating in the sailor's selfless warning that crystallizes differently. The progression from gems to bell marks meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in Silas's "trembling with the effort" and the emotional weight of "shared weight, a communion with the departed." One clear tightening through accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from random drips to observed patterns to conducted melody to bell restoration.

One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional duty (documenting the impossible recession) through personal recognition (the sapphire bottle) to intimate confrontation (finding his childhood home and photos).

The cost manifests in his acceptance of bearing "weight, precisely, humanely" for a ghost town.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes build from personal (proving her life's work) to universal (transforming the orchard) through Elara's experimental progression.

Cost manifests in her "shattered composure" and tears, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth without sufficient resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate causally: automated signal → single life detected → broken buckle crisis → improvised solution under time pressure. The protagonist's agency drives each turn, with visible cost in bearing witness alone to potential failure. One meaningful tightening when the buckle breaks, forcing innovation.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes clearly established - Kaelen must integrate his preserved emotions or "forever be half a man." Escalation tracks through memory waves of increasing intensity (lost love→betrayal→full torrent) with Kaelen's response evolving from recoil to acceptance. The cost manifests in experiencing all suppressed pain to achieve wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to active threat as Elara discovers the seed's weaponization potential and hunters arrive. The protagonist drives the resolution through her escape room trap, though the antagonists' arrival feels convenient and their specific threat remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from mechanical action to emotional breakthrough as the leaf blower's "dissonant chord" builds through "spectral lullabies" to the wife's appearance and laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal homesickness to cosmic erosion when the guardian reveals the library's decay. The pendant as corrosive artifact creates genuine pressure requiring action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through five reconstruction attempts, each teaching Elara something new about destruction's balance. The shift from "too violent" to "too gentle" to finding the "profound silence" shows meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in the thousand prior failures and the complete annihilation required for transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)

Cost manifests in his transformed understanding and permanent burden.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation from controlled weaving to aggressive forcing when the memory resists, culminating in the pattern's violent eruption. The cost is visible in the destroyed loom and dead thread.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the diamond's resistance threatening to "shatter the bone towers and her own mind," with clear tightening when dissonance must be woven into the symphony rather than eliminated.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from academic vindication to existential transformation as the arrowhead's playful pull intensifies and reality warps. The dominant stake (proving cosmic absurdity) deepens when Elara realizes she must become the joke herself. Cost is legible—she trades human form for transcendent understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through textural density: soft melody→thrumming foundation→earth vibrating→trees uprooting→statues transforming.

The music's method creates genuine pressure that narrows options to this specific resonant frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal risk (courier in disputed territory) through the contraband exchange to the revelation about Elara's missing son. The drone's "silent and judging" hover creates tension before accepting the trade. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael must decide whether to trade the dangerous artifact for uncertain information.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to complete the abandoned work—develops through accumulative pressure rather than explicit conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.1)
    The scarf triggers escalation from normal library to hyperbolic space to narrative nexus, with stakes deepening through geometric transformation. However, the student's interruption deflates tension without consequence, and Elara's transformation lacks concrete trade-offs—she gains cosmic awareness without losing anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure: from routine light-gathering to the "sharp, desperate cry" that triggers frantic action, to the beam's transformation of the entire archipelago.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate through the unraveling process as "lucid unrest intensified" and temperature drops with spirit manifestation. The revelation of malice (rope cut by rival) deepens the tragedy.

However, the conflict lacks active opposition; the choice feels somewhat predetermined by her established empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional detachment through supernatural encounter to personal transformation about the nature of endings. The thread-untangling sequence provides concrete pressure with "meticulous care" required to separate "threads of memory from the cord of binding regret." Cost is visible in the ghost's release and Elara's emotional shift, though the encounter with Death lacks sufficient resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—articulating unspoken needs—develops through the encoding process with the storm as deadline pressure. The lightning strike provides a decisive moment. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance; the encoding proceeds too smoothly without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs that would elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear dominant stake: restart the crystal or drift forever. Escalation builds from observation to theory to action with genuine risk (failure means continued drift).

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—learning "the rhythm of repair"—escalates from physical lock-picking to conceptual restoration of a fractured moment. Pressure builds through the mirror maze forcing Elara to confront all her possible selves before finding their common rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal ("physical ache") through mechanical (clock repair) to communal (city's fundamental rhythm).

Cost appears in the "severed nerve" and week of accumulated discord.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from repairing a device to risking neural entanglement, with the deepening revelation that memories alter her synaptic pathways permanently.

The transformation happens without visible struggle or trade-off that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: arranging markers, opening the veil, witnessing failure, then confronting the shadow fragment. The protagonist's agency drives each phase, with the flute's "calming note" demonstrating mastery through restraint rather than force. Cost appears in the markers losing their light and the permanent alteration of how silence feels.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to psychic survival as the empathy torrent threatens dissolution. The protagonist's agency drives the experiment and the desperate disengagement.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes escalate from professional task to personal obsession as Elara experiences the "profound, aching regret" and becomes tied to the truth.

Slight limitation in that the conflict is primarily technical rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: daily ritual → finding the pendulum bob ("profound dissonance") → dragging it from water → choosing to leave it as "monument to fallibility." The cost lands clearly: Elara forfeits her identity and purpose, forcing the village into "shared responsibility." One meaningful deepening that reweights all prior recovery work.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from understanding the past to resurrection responsibility. The golden thread discovery tightens pressure by revealing the sovereign case, which requires further untangling to open. Cost is visible in Elara's isolation and the weight of becoming humanity's sole resurrectionist ("ready to begin").

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (survival vs. extinction) is signaled early and escalates from data analysis through doubt to final action. The internal conflict between "old ways" and innovation creates genuine tension, with the "fragile model" providing clear risk. The tremor at the end suggests immediate consequence of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving stories in a world that has banned them—intensifies through Elara's progression from passive listener to active translator. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as pressure builds through listening deeper until she hears the dust's own song. Cost is visible in her transformation from teacher to conduit.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from capturing "profound quiet" through the ritual's "delicate balance" where "one errant breath could undo everything," to the child's sneeze that destroys yet paradoxically completes the work. The cost is unmistakable: the portrait dissolves, but this loss reveals art's true purpose as witness rather than preservation. Under the Accumulative lens, density builds through stillness, ritual precision, then explosive dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    The competing narratives create clear stakes—preserve complex truth vs. maintain simple stability—with Silas's discovery escalating the dilemma. His choice to transform conflict into teaching method shows agency, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily without testing his commitment through greater resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from department closure through Leo's potential expulsion to the deeper challenge of transforming hatred. The zither demonstration creates a meaningful deepening that shifts Leo from defensive to questioning. Cost is visible in Anya's resignation thinning to fragile hope and Leo's "armored resolve" softening.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through the plant's transformation from careful planting to explosive, chaotic growth threatening the greenhouse structure. The pruning sequence deepens stakes—each cut releases overwhelming memories that Elara must absorb. Cost is visible in the "fractured memories" she must destroy and the physical/emotional toll of containing creation's chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from city starvation threat to personal vulnerability when Elara must expose her secret. The pressure tightens through her compulsion forcing the reveal ("I might have something"), with visible cost in her trembling hands and confession. Resolution emerges from protagonist agency despite the truthfulness constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what makes houses feel alive—evolves meaningfully from intellectual curiosity to embodied participation. The confluence moment where past and present merge creates genuine pressure that forces Elara's choice. Cost is visible in her surrender of analytical distance. The escalation through accumulating objects works under the textural lens, though could use slightly more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: certainty fissures → first movement in millennia → revelation of purposeful design. The dominant stake (understanding purpose vs. mere watching) tightens when the Statue must choose to reveal the column's weakness. Cost is legible in the weight shift from burden to blanket, though the resolution trends slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through mathematical proofs toward the "most ambitious yet" calculation requiring true acceptance of the chipped die. The cost is legible when Elara must trust the chaos she's spent eternity quantifying. The rupture's "soundless sonic boom" effectively deepens stakes by transforming the prison's nature rather than offering escape.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative density as Elara progresses from discovering the brush to mastering its vision-guidance to completing the painting under the full moon. The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—faces its test when the crowd arrives "wary and coated in the city's grime" then transforms through recognition. Cost is visible in the inherited weight of misunderstood ancestors ("they said she was a thief").

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—cultural survival through active practice versus passive memory—escalates from the honey's absence through Elara's challenge to the communal transformation. The climbing sequence provides physical risk that mirrors the emotional stakes. Cost manifests in the "melting on their tongues" image where identity literally dissolves to be internalized.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsession through the assembly sequence to accessing time's source—"the energy of paths not walked." The pressure tightens as physics protests and latent radiance appears. Cost emerges in the "terrible and beautiful potential" though the physical/emotional toll on Elias could be more dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from initial disorientation through the advisor's revelation to the central confrontation, with Elara's counter-intuitive strategy of feeding the entity paradoxes creating genuine tension. The cost—having to expose her deepest fears through coded language—is palpable. Minor deduction for the entity's somewhat generic hunger motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from reading the storm to conducting it, with each wave and wind gust raising physical danger. The tightening occurs when Kai must transform destruction in real-time or be destroyed. Cost is legible in the "violent gust meant to splinter his world" becoming harmonic, foreclosing the path of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from isolation through forbidden investigation to the decisive gate-breaking action. The whistle discovery creates genuine reversal that narrows options to a single risky attempt. Cost is visible in the irreversible fracturing of the gate and the daunting journey ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal doubt to national truth, tightening when Elara demands destruction versus Aris's preservation. The parallel-drawing method creates genuine pressure—Aris must persuade or lose the artifact. Cost is visible: accepting complicity while preserving evidence. One meaningful tightening achieved through the persuasion sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from documenting history to confronting personal loss, with the locket forcing genuine cost (emotional breakdown). The escalation follows accumulative logic as each note-placement builds toward the personal revelation. However, the final paragraph retreats into safer reflection rather than sustaining peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from cataloging duty to civilizational truth when the palimpsest reveals conquest rather than welcome. The blackout's unique cover ("no system logs") tightens Elara's choice window, and her decision to mislabel carries the clear cost of becoming complicit in historical erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—transforming grief—tightens through the crafting process, with the island's descent-while-ascending creating external pressure that mirrors internal conflict. The final release carries visible cost: she must let go of her last memory to create something new. Agency manifests through creative transformation rather than confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal trauma through the timed window of the power cycle to the cosmic discovery of K-7B. The pressure coheres well under the Accumulative lens, building density through sensory layering. Cost is visible in her transformation but the abstract nature of "potential pools" slightly dampens the visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds from observation directive through theory-testing to physical abandonment of post, with clear cost in violating orders. The "pull" on consciousness raises stakes effectively. Missing a stronger mid-story reversal or complication that would force adaptation rather than smooth execution of plan.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (Elara's guilt vs. client's need) established early and tightens when the real memory "seeped through her concentration," forcing her to confront the truth she's burying. The revelation transforms simple fabrication into active harm. Cost visible in her trembling hands and the weight of compounded guilt, though the client remains somewhat passive.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds cleanly: mistrust → forced wait → exchange begins → spit triggers crisis → drawer pull intervention. The "knife's edge" moment where violence nearly erupts carries genuine stakes. Cost manifests in the "space where an apology might one day grow" - potential rather than resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding direction after losing navigational ability—intensifies through the "backlash of regrets" sequence where each pole triggers painful memories. The osprey moment provides meaningful deepening that reweights Elias's understanding of navigation itself. Cost is legible in his acceptance of being "lost" as a valid state, though escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear escalation from searching newspapers to navigating dangerous caves to the emotional risk of facing the grandson. The dominant stake (kindling empathy) tightens when Elara chooses connection over profit. Cost is visible but the final confrontation could use more concrete pressure beyond the grandson's facial expression.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from failed conjuring (spectral echo) through despair to revelation and transformation. The fortune's reinterpretation creates a meaningful deepening that changes Elara's approach entirely. However, the "reluctant metamorphosis of reality" faces little active opposition—the world's resistance is stated rather than dramatized through concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through ritual accumulation—blood offering, card laying, vision unfastening—each deepening Silas's understanding rather than reversing it. The spectral keeper's warning that "The vessel is cracked. The memory will be imperfect" forces Silas to accept limitation with his response "All vessels are." Cost becomes visible in witnessing "a painful, exquisite map of his love and his failings."

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating emotional weight that becomes literal gravitational force, then transforms through the stitching process. The protagonist's agency drives every beat—discovering photos, choosing to mend rather than succumb, combining tear with stitched image. Cost is legible in processing "accumulated sorrow of generations."

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: walking → unscrewing jar → fireflies rising → sand glowing → final understanding. The cost is legible (her destitution reframed as necessary), though agency remains mostly receptive rather than decisive—she's "orchestrated" by atmosphere rather than choosing.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—exposing the Luminary's greed versus maintaining order—escalates through Kael's choices. His decision to bypass main lines and power only the presses represents a meaningful tightening that forecloses his return to simple duty. The cost is legible in the risk of discovery and the irreversible nature of the printed manifests.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the mathematical sequence completion, the eels' emergence, and the appearance of the star dust - each tightening toward the moment of alignment. The cost is legible when Kaelen must become "part of the pattern" rather than its controller. Agency drives the resolution through his conscious shift from herding to aligning.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal ritual to public resistance as the timer creates genuine urgency. The transformation from reading to writing to releasing represents meaningful deepening under textural pressure, though the middle section could tighten - the "terrifying, storm-kissed wonder" paragraph observes without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from philosophical combat through coded positions to the revelation of collaboration, with clear tightening as options narrow. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost - neither character sacrifices their position or faces meaningful loss in choosing partnership over conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from sorting books to discovering the key to accessing forbidden archives to transcribing silenced voices.

Cost is visible in the danger both men accept and Silas's emotional response, though the external consequences could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from playing piano to discovering the hidden film canister, from passive viewing to active navigation, from broken clock to repurposed mechanism.

Cost is visible in the temporary nature of the reunion and the elaborate effort required for this single moment of grace.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation: dimming blooms → approaching monsoon → dormant seed → first raindrop creates effective pressure. The tightening timeline forces Elara's decisive action. Cost is legible—the monsoon arrives "in earnest" but the memories survive. Stakes remain coherent throughout with the monsoon as persistent external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding meaning in irreparable loss) signaled early and deepened through the compass leading to lace discovery, which forecloses the path of external resolution. The tightening from seeking apology's color to accepting shared regret shows clear escalation under the accumulative lens, with visible cost in accepting the severance's permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to process loss—tightens through the discovery of the dust patterns and the wing’s residue. The key turn is her revaluation of “decay” into creation and accepting involvement, foreclosing her initial coping tactic. Pressure is quiet but coherent for the lens, with a visible internal price. Slight softness in external stakes keeps it just below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting and continuing a fragile knowledge chain versus returning to her old life—is clear and tightens once with the fissure discovery. The decision not to rebuild her studio forecloses a live path with cost. Pressure is quiet and situational rather than adversarial; absence of on‑page antagonist limits peak tension. Still, the narrative deepens options/knowledge meaningfully in a single tightening turn.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the Starlight Bloom’s spirit/microclimate—is clear and escalates with the spreading fissure and fading aura. Elara adapts tactics (cycling forks, mapping emotions) and pays a physical price, which charges the ending. The conflict is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens. A single meaningful tightening suffices; no artificial reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (whether to answer the call at the cost of his curated stillness) is established early and tightened by the decision to pulse the code and then to descend himself. Escalation is coherent and paced (signal unanswered, then answered; surface to depth), driven by Silas’s agency. The price remains subtle—he pays in orientation and existential shift rather than a concrete loss—which trims sharpness. Still, the deepening from curiosity to commitment is credible and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (survival/hope vs. secrecy under sanctions) and escalate gently via the donations and the appearance of the bell. The crucial tightening is Elara choosing to announce partnership publicly, shifting from secrecy to collective acknowledgment. The price is suggested (potential risk to donor/commune) rather than made concrete on the page. Tension is steady but restrained, fitting the piece’s quiet design.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (integrating past-life sorrow by channeling compassion) is signaled early and tightened when the tear is found and then deliberately expended. The escalation is gentle but legible: curiosity → discovery → release, with the irreversible loss of the tear as the price. There’s little opposition or risk beyond surrender, which keeps pressure subdued. Still, agency drives the climax rather than coincidence solving it.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (escape the temporal fold) is clear and escalates from awe to entrapment to a high‑pressure mental gambit. The tightening is coherent: paralysis removes physical options, forcing a risky conceptual tactic with a price. The cost reads in the dimmed relic and psychic tremor afterward. Escalation is strong but concentrated into one decisive intensification rather than multiple compounding turns.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible from the outset: delaying the militia to save the seed-bearers and vault. Escalation coheres—arrival of militia compresses time; decoding becomes the bottleneck; obstruction demands a sacrifice. The visible price (self-imprisonment) is unmistakable. A secondary reversal (bullet strikes as she dives) sustains tension without diluting focus.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through the live window and vent eruption, culminating in the capture and imprint. Agency is steady (activate, navigate, command imprint), with a clear tightening at the eruption. The price is emotional rupture and acceptance of limits, which charges the ending. Stakes remain intimate but decisive for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (artistic integrity vs. client’s sabotage) tighten when the woman appears and the client’s intent reframes the job. The reversal—choosing not to “steal” the couple but to distill the charged air—forecloses a lucrative path. Pressure is coherent and escalates under a causal lens. The tangible price could be sharpened with a clearer immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether she can create safety by thawing herself—tightens as the external melt accelerates; the ice sheet’s drop forces stance crystallization.

Slight neatness at the end keeps it just shy of a harsher price.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (claiming identity/agency) is clear and tightens once when Marcus arrives, forcing a stance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capturing the night’s silence before dawn—is signaled early and tightens with the live clock (“the eastern horizon began to bleed”).

No antagonistic force beyond time, but pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—resolve the directive to find thought’s origin—is signaled early and tightens as timelines layer.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is established early and tightens when the lens reframes the doodles into the hornet pattern, converting uncertainty into a choice to risk showing Leo.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Elara keeping her vocation against metric‑based expropriation—tightens with the official’s arrival and culminates in her ritual assertion. Escalation is coherent under the lens; the decisive beat is her continued polishing, which triggers the maze’s response. The cost is implied (social marginalization, potential reassignment) rather than enacted on the page, keeping this just shy of higher bands. Still, agency clearly drives the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (validation of a theory) is clear and the meaningful tightening occurs at the lever pull and hologram’s shift. Yet pressure remains gentle; there’s no palpable cost or foreclosed option beyond her earlier rewiring. The escalation is internal and procedural rather than contested. The resolution feels earned but low in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (contact/deciphering) tightens through the call‑and‑response into a bodily, risked crescendo. Escalation is clearly protagonist‑driven; each phrase invites a stronger reply, culminating in the whirlpool apparition. The cost is more experiential than consequential, so stakes feel intimate rather than perilous. Still, the cadence shift at the finale is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake (confirm or refute catastrophic flood) escalates through a concrete tightening: outside check fails, options narrow, she turns to the overlooked margin. Physical and temporal prices sharpen the choice, culminating in an alert “with seconds to spare.” Stakes remain coherent and personal even as they’re vast. The internal and external pressures interlock to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (test truth with real consequence) is signaled early and tightens at the wheel; the ghost shift intensifies pressure into a decisive act. Agency drives the turn; the release carries a visible and conceptual price (effort, risk, and acceptance of complicity/absolution). Internal and external pressures interlock well. A slight additional foreclosed option (e.g., the danger of not turning) could have sharpened the tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve the library’s stability to preserve his duty) is present early and tightens with the subterranean groan. Escalation deepens via the vibration realm and the traumatic knot; the decisive tactic is endurance/attention rather than confrontation. The visible price is mostly internal and understated, so stakes read lofty but a bit frictionless. Still, agency drives the turn at the fault in a way consistent with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (reaching Leo) tightens from quiet, stalled therapy to a charged, time-bound attempt under the eclipse. Pressure coheres under the causal lens; totality serves as the single, decisive intensification. The visible price is restraint under fragile conditions and the possibility of failure. Slightly soft on explicit counterforce, but silence and time pressure suffice at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates texturally rather than through reversals: each artifact deepens stakes and culminates in a reweighted mission. The dominant stake is legible early (recovering suppressed truth to rekindle dreaming). Cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the “terrible new weight” and foreclosed ignorance give the ending charge. A sharper, on‑page trade‑off would lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Leo accepts the conductor role—tightens at the reveal that Alistair “received your cookie.” The reversal reweights the mission from drop‑off to initiation, narrowing options credibly. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, and danger remains implied rather than tested, but the escalation is coherent under a causal lens. The final step toward the controls reads as earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (anchor survival vs. possession) is established early; pressure coheres as the entity escalates from thrum to mocking voice. The meaningful tightening is the protagonist’s counterintuitive decision to stop defending, paying a visible price. Resolution arises from his altered stance, not luck. Stakes are more conceptual than visceral, but the costs and turns are unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (achieve the conducting before focus/exhaustion lapses) is clear and pressure tightens at dawn’s alignment. The decisive act—superimposing the remembered hum—narrows options and triggers the phenomenon. Cost is explicit in the collapse; the trade is focus and stamina for completion and arrival. Escalation relies on cadence and density rather than reversals, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are unified around self‑overcoming; pressure tightens through the narrowing path, memory‑rooms, and the inversion chamber to the pool confrontation. The decisive inner move—acceptance rather than domination—forecloses a prior path of compulsive retries. The costs (surrender of exceptionalism, relinquishing a protective misbelief) are legible. No antagonist is needed; the internal/external weave holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—defeating numbness—intensifies through a clear deepening from passive reception (recorder) to reciprocal creation (drum and mallet). The felt price (tears, ache, surrendering the needle) reweights the end. Pressure is internally coherent; one strong cadence shift suffices at this length. A sharper on-page moment of hesitation before taking the mallet could further heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (truth vs safety) is signaled and coherently tightened by the follower, the alarming stitched message, the industrial hum/incineration inference, and the curfew siren. The meaningful turn is her shift from private safety to public risk via evidence transmission. Price is concrete: increased exposure under surveillance and curfew. Escalation is protagonist‑driven through analysis and the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: whether to preserve or release memory through scent. Escalation is clear—anticipation, bloom, involuntary tears, admission of motive—culminating in the costly choice to break the seal and give it away. The clock (minutes-long bloom) tightens the window credibly. The price is unmistakable and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens decisively when the vision reframes the rope as a key with catastrophic consequence. The ethical calculus is sharp, forcing a trade‑off between knowledge and erasure of a hopeful lineage. Resolution comes from Kael’s agency with a felt price. Minor modesty: stakes remain conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in the erased lives.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (can her art awaken life) is signaled early and tightens when initial notes are swallowed, forcing an adaptive choice to play with silence. The palpable “ping” and seed crack provide a decisive turn; resolution arises from her altered tactic, not luck. Price is primarily internal—humility and surrender to the environment—so the felt risk remains gentler than the premise’s apocalyptic canvas. Still, tension scales appropriately for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: the technical task shifts into an ethical crisis when the static becomes a bridge. The turn (from selling a convincing half truth to bearing the real thing) forecloses a path and exacts immediate cost. Stakes remain singular and legible—protect a stranger at personal expense. Escalation is internal but unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—translating gratitude into action—tightens as the misaddress creates a setback and the bereavement letter redefines the path. Elara’s decision to give up the photo and meet Henry is a modest but real price. Escalation is quiet, coherent, and driven by her agency, though pressures remain gentle and largely internal. No coincidence resolves the plot; it complicates it appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are coherent—belonging and ethical welcome—but pressure escalates gently rather than decisively. The strongest tightening beat is Elara facing the community’s palpable expectation and choosing to promise instead of reveal. The price of that choice is mostly conceptual and soft on the page; no immediate backlash or sacrificed resource registers beyond trust risk. The lyric accumulation sustains tension without a sharp turn.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (capture the final specimen before the giant wakes) is clear and escalates coherently via the increasing temporal fracture and the frozen tower. The decisive tightening is Elara’s choice to borrow from the giant’s nap and shape a lens, risking rupture to free the echo. The immediate price feels more experiential than lasting. Nonetheless, agency drives the turn and earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early: detect her brother’s emotional signature. Pressure tightens at the void reading (“hollow zero”), producing despair and the subsequent tactile turn; this forecloses one live path (finding him) and reframes the objective. Cost is legible in the acceptance of non‑resolution. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but it’s sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on whether Silas can realize a form of visibility; the meaningful tightening is the tape’s voice reweighting his method. Escalation is subtle and internal; no antagonist, but pressure coheres as purpose crystallizes. Cost is implied more than dramatized, keeping the tension elegant but soft. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s stance toward control—tightens once she confronts the wreckage and chooses reconstruction by yielding. The incorporation of the fallen branch is a clear deepening that changes options. Pressure remains coherent, but the escalation is more contemplative than contested, so the felt price is modest. Still, the end-image reweights stakes under the live pressure of the next storm.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning under desiccation—tightens through the brooch-induced encounter and the nightlong exchange. The turn to “exchange is the key” reweights options; her choice to paint the convergence forecloses the old tactic of isolation. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, not a hard trade, but it’s legible. Tension builds coherently without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on whether to grant entry to an unseen confluence at the cost of changing Elara’s gift. Escalation is a felt deepening rather than reversal: the tapestry reframes the goal and the silent “ask” tightens pressure into a decision. The price is legible but the struggle to consent is relatively unopposed, tempering intensity. Still, the single decisive tightening suits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—wresting meaning from the fragment—tightens at the ledger omission and resolves in a reframed mission. The reveal interweaves external research with internal price (her exile). Pressure is quiet but coherent under the causal lens, with one decisive deepening rather than multiple turns. Stakes stay personal and conceptual, not visceral, which keeps intensity moderated.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early: reach the fortress by earning passage. Pressure tightens meaningfully when the warden demands an unspoken truth, forcing a trade‑off between secrecy and progress. The price is paid on the page; internal and external threads interlock. The escalation is single but sufficient, with no coincidence resolving the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—responding to profound loneliness—intensifies as the tile’s sensations swell into a symphony that demands a decision. The meaningful tightening occurs when she rejects mere cataloging to “answer his call” through transcription, which reweights options and ends the tile’s claim on her. The price is a relinquishing of skeptical distance for vulnerable engagement. Conflict is primarily internal but coherent and escalatory for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is focused and escalates once: the storm’s intrusion forces a decision that narrows options and risks obliteration. The internal and external pressures cohere, and the commitment moment is clear. The price is more conceptual than visceral, which slightly mutes tension. Nonetheless, agency drives the turn and reweights her options at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on reinterpreting the father and committing to protect Aris, with pressure escalating through two ink-induced revelations (forgery; Aris’s true face). The tightening is thematic rather than oppositional; options narrow as her worldview liquefies. The price of complicity and risk is present but largely conceptual. A concrete external pressure would sharpen the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake is focused—capture the dawn’s unique resonance—and pressure coheres around a single temporal window. Escalation occurs as the hum refracts into layered histories, then collapses back at true dawn. The felt price remains modest, with little adversarial force beyond time and attention. Still, the tightening cadence is clear and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    The poisoning label is a clean escalation that reframes the project from elegiac cataloging to dangerous truth‑work, narrowing K’s options to acting or colluding in silence. The agency at the end is clear and stakes are moral rather than physical. Still, external antagonism is implied rather than enacted on the page, so the cost is more conceptual than felt through resistance. One concrete on‑page threat would have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes—finding a true way to “hear” the universe—tighten as the hum intensifies and the compass resolves, forcing a stance: listener/participant, not mere skeptic. The meaningful turn is the shell/cello convergence leading to the bow stroke. Cost is present but mostly conceptual; external resistance is minimal. Even one small obstructive snag (e.g., tool failure demanding adaptation) might have heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are legible early (protect community integrity under privatization), and the clock to inspection tightens pressure. The meaningful trade‑off—ceding prime spots (Hem’s move) to preserve communal agency—reads as a visible price. Escalation is modest but coherent: official reorg paired with clandestine reclamation culminates in a defiant, reweighted carnival. Slight softness in on‑page resistance keeps this below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—bear witness before miners erase the site—tightens through the slowing pulse, plummeting temperature, and dawn’s approach. Escalation is endurance‑driven and culminates in the cadence shift at alignment; knowledge deepens when she decodes the spiral as a star map. The visible price (hours of waiting, physical discomfort, risk of missing the moment) registers clearly. A single, strong tightening suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are legible early (maiden voyage in three hours; without the core, no direction). Escalation tightens once: the corrupted hum reveals the real problem and narrows options to a precise, risky patch. The resolution arises from her agency, but the path is fairly smooth—no meaningful setback or cost beyond clock pressure. Tension operates more through procedure than jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes cohere around finding the source and transform into a duty to herald as the pressure concentrates (wind dies, surface clarifies, word redefines). Escalation is a decisive intensification via convergence rather than conflict beats or reversals. The cost—abandoning an empirical target for a mythic charge—is felt but not dramatized through loss beyond vocation. The fisher’s intervention is catalytic without feeling coincidental as a resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reviving the town’s balance—is signaled early and tightens when she shifts from diagnostic steps to a declarative rhythm. The escalation is primarily textural, but the turn to the center‑of‑square invocation is a clear agency beat. Cost clarity is modest (the revival is brief; solitude persists), yet sufficient at this length. No antagonist, but pressure coheres around endurance and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens via time pressure and the moral pivot from extraction to exchange. The key turn—choosing to give memories rather than pull—narrows options and carries a felt price. The ending’s loss underscores consequence. Slightly limited escalation breadth; once she chooses reciprocity, the path unfolds without additional complications.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear: prevent the lie‑entity from escaping and redefine his legacy before discovery. Escalation tightens plausibly: storm → loosened door → chapel/bodies → entity forms and heads for the stairs; the narrowing corridor of options forces a risky, identity‑costing choice (speak truth vs. silence). Cost is present though mostly implied, landing in the final wait for the boat. Agency, not coincidence, resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (repay the debt/awaken the orchard) is legible early and tightens when Elara breaks her cameo pattern. Leo’s agency in accepting the bead triggers the irreversible cost of Elara’s dissolution. Pressure escalates once, appropriately scaled for the length. The price—solitude in exchange for renewal—is clear in the closing hum and light.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (mend the labyrinth) and pressure coheres as she finds the main fissure and commits to the all‑night repair. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversals, consistent with the chosen lens; the clock of night and mounting fatigue tighten options. The price—exhaustion and the acceptance that repair adorns rather than erases—reads as a meaningful narrowing. A sharper on‑page complication or falter would have amplified stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (belonging/faith) tightens through discovering the inert sundial and committing to rebuild it. Agency drives escalation: she fashions the gnomon and physically opens the tomb. The price reads more as risk/respect and effort than concrete sacrifice, which slightly softens the edge of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (decode and mail on time) is signaled and tightened by the live clock and initial failure. The meaningful turn is the juxtaposition alignment that narrows options and resolves the puzzle. Pressure is coherent and increases; the price paid is urgency/time with the implied consequence of missing the rendezvous if he fails. Stakes stay intimate but consequential to the scene’s purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear early: prevent a cosmological-political false flag and the coup. Pressure tightens through the tapestry’s “wrongness” to a single viable route (Western Gate), and the public stakes converge with her private risk. The persuasion beat resolves quickly, muting perceived cost and narrowing of options at the peak. Still, escalation coheres and is driven by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: access the liminal pre‑decision moment to unlock an apology. Escalation deepens via guided descent, encounter with the keeper, and the condensation reveal, culminating in the relinquishment of the letters. Pressure is coherent and grows, though opposition is soft (persistent but not hostile guides). The cost—surrendering the letters and confronting the truth in water—lands.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: breaking a child’s silence without re‑traumatizing him. Escalation is a single, meaningful deepening as Elara translates the cast into a survivable narrative, narrowing from chaotic smear to “the bad part.” The price—emotional exposure and physical strain under anesthesia—is legible. Quiet but decisive agency drives the turn to speech.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: will she rekindle creative joy. Escalation tightens via the shift from private ache to public display and culminates in the installation’s ephemerality as a felt price. The crowd’s arrival deepens pressure without resolving it by coincidence; the fade forecloses permanence. Tension is gentle rather than sharp, but it meaningfully reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres: initial hum to accidental ignition to weakening cadence that forces Elara’s committed intervention. The narrowing window (song fading) functions as a meaningful tightening, and her choice forecloses the safe “restore” path. The price is primarily professional/philosophical, not immediate personal peril, keeping stakes high but contained.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: Auditors closing in force a decisive trade-off—preserve the code or preserve the people. The emergency “hawk” signal and destructive scramble foreclose a path with legible price. Stakes stay singular (protect the network/defiance) and escalate cleanly to an earned, consequential outcome. No soft resets or coincidence rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: translate the lullabies to win a night of peace. Escalation is lyric but real—the songs “grow clearer,” her writing intensifies into painful conduit work, and the wind’s dissonance resolves only after the final line. The cost (spirit wrenching, surrender to sleep) is legible and alters her state. While not reversal‑driven, the decisive tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens when the chime fails, forcing a new tactic with risk. Escalation is accumulative via the night‑long sequence, with a meaningful turn at the first hum’s success. Cost is primarily emotional and temporal; the piece could sharpen visible price slightly. Still, agency drives the resolution rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are clearly signaled (decipher before dawn; restore trust), and pressure accumulates as the text loosens and answers begin to sing. The main tightening is her active linking of promises, but resistance is low—once the method engages, the path to success is smooth. The cost is primarily emotional and temporal rather than a hard trade‑off. Effective, but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coherently escalates from subtle listening to catastrophic risk to an ethical fork (butcher’s release vs. machinist’s bleed). The decisive reroute narrows options and carries emotional cost, even absent a physical sacrifice. Stakes remain focused and legible. A tangible loss or consequence on the page would have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—whether she will risk trust to surface the geologist’s truth—tightens from anomaly to choice. The turn from pigeons to “This required a person” is a credible narrowing that carries risk (tracking, exposure). Internal and external pressures interweave without gimmicks; escalation is modest but purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused (get to Leo; understand thresholds) and tighten when the world tilts into the terrace and when the codes translate to emotional climate. Escalation is coherent and Elara-driven, culminating in forming the calm corridor. The cost feels light—no visible loss or hard trade-off beyond risk and urgency—so tension doesn’t fully bite. Still, the narrowing of options and the final sprint deliver a satisfying rise.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: panic vs. belonging. Escalation follows the textural lens—tension peaks at the feather and eases through the fireflies’ arrival, deepening options via attention and endurance. Agency reads as a choice to seek air/space and to remain through the night, foreclosing immediate flight from the trigger. The price is quiet but legible: accepting a world that includes loss.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: complete the fractured memory to answer why paths vanish. Pressure coheres via the missing pieces and the fading window; the seed arrival complicates then enables a decisive deepening. Escalation is modest and largely inward; no real foreclosed option besides ignorance. The price is conceptual rather than tactical, which keeps the tension elegant but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: will he accept predictable mastery or risk disorder to achieve true serendipity. The meaningful tightening arrives with the seen “checkmate in three” followed by the queen sacrifice—an on-page price that forecloses the win. Her counter-choice to stand the bishop beside the queen pays off the tension as a human, not strategic, resolution. The conflict is quiet but precise; no wasted beats or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—completing a forbidden verse—is clear, and escalation is a density increase culminating in the seven-pointed star and ignition. The tightening is internal and craft-driven rather than oppositional; options narrow mainly by commitment to completion. Visible cost is modest on the page (pain, risk kept off-stage). The resolution is earned but not pressure-cooked.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—transforming private perception into guiding light—is legible, and pressure coheres via the “unease” to urgent return. Escalation is gentle; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond time‑sensitivity to the new lens. The cost is largely conceptual, which softens tension, though the tightening from ripple sign to lens activation works. The resolution is earned but low-temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake (what to do with the ashes/what saving means) tightens as she opens the box, confronts the ashes’ history, and chooses release. Escalation is a deepening cadence rather than reversal, appropriate to the lens. The price—surrendering the talisman and a self‑image of infallibility—reads clearly. No antagonist needed; pressure coheres from ritual constraint and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (revitalizing hope/the world’s fabric) are clear, and pressure coheres as the needle’s behavior escalates with her interventions. The decisive tightening occurs when she reconceives hope as resonance and commits to the final spiral. The price skews conceptual; no hard trade‑off beyond abandoning her prior equation frame, which tempers the ferocity of tension. Still, agency—not coincidence—drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: recover the hidden negative and, by extension, the house’s soul. Pressure tightens through puzzle-solving and a single physical test (finding the hollow behind the panel). Opposition is mostly environmental and internalized; tangible jeopardy is minimal, so the price reads more as duty than risk. Still, the deepening from data-gathering to legacy‑keeping provides a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake is clear (persuade mirrors), with a coherent tightening as resistance leads to heightened song/heartbeat utilization. The decisive intensification occurs when light overflows into the hall, followed by the bell’s interruption. Cost is articulated through the heartbeat’s release and loss of immediate control. Slightly soft antagonistic force keeps it just short of peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—ratifying peace before the zenith—arrives early and tightens as Kaelen enters and the alignment nears. The meaningful deepening is the ritual activation and its seal at the exact moment of merged light, with cost internalized in their grief and surrendered certainties. Pressure remains coherent and grows under the hybrid lens, though the path faces no on‑page interference beyond time. The emotional price is understated but present, charging the quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (memorializing extinction vs. honoring a real cost) tightens through the thunder lull and the basin’s center. The decisive turn—feeling warmth and choosing not to shatter—forecloses an option and exacts a price (abandonment of his design, surrender of the egg). Pressure is coherent and grows under a hybrid lens without melodrama. The external rain intensifies consequence rather than offering an easy out.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (resisting conformity by harvesting echoes) is signaled early and tightened by the sanctuary’s pulsing vibration that threatens to “unmoor her soul.” The escalation is internally driven and coherent under the accumulative lens. However, options don’t visibly narrow in a way that forces a trade‑off beyond endurance; the price is mostly implied. Still, the culminating pull and flare provide a credible peak.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—artistic ethics vs. market palatability—is clear and tightens through the object‑driven reversal. Escalation is mostly internal; the stick’s flip is the meaningful turn that narrows options toward refusal plus a new path. Concrete price is underplayed (no active counterforce on the page), which softens the felt stakes. Still, the resolution is agentive and earned by the accumulated pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early (witness/honor the last monarch) and escalates with the crack and entanglement. The tightening forces a precise, high‑risk tactic (knot/lever) rather than brute intervention. The price paid is primarily risk and interrupted reverie rather than a lasting loss.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (will she capture the names) is stated early and escalates through her choice to abandon pure replication and reweave the rope as conduit. The furnace lighting and pour are the meaningful tightening moment. However, obstacles are minimal and success comes without a reversal or visible price beyond risk and relinquished self‑reproach. Tension is steady rather than mounting.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (obey decaying directive vs. follow dream to transform) is signaled early and tightened by the storm and system failure. The crucial tightening forecloses the maintenance path when she presses the seal, paying with identity and purpose. Internal and external pressures interweave cleanly, with escalation reading as a coherent squeeze rather than empty intensifiers. Cost remains visible in the renunciation of function and body.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (control vs surrender/guardianship) is signaled early and tightened when the priestess attacks by consuming his representations. Escalation is coherent: his rational method changes options under pressure, culminating in the uncloak command. The cost is legible—burden accepted, tools sacrificed (charts), path foreclosed. One scene, one decisive deepening; efficient and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (convince Kael to release resentment) is clear early and tightens meaningfully with the broken melody beat. The failure moment escalates pressure before the final acceptance. Costs are internal and not deeply priced, keeping the turn modest. Still, the reversal tests commitment credibly within this length.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are singular (manifest the dream), and pressure escalates when the mirror threatens to shatter, forcing a tactic shift. The decisive adjustment—invite vs. force—narrows options and exacts a cost (sacrifice of control and tool). Tension coheres through the breathing cadence and intensifying light, then releases into a steady luminescence. The conflict is largely internal but remains scene‑driven and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake (purpose after professional erasure) is clear and tightens through the crafting sequence and the arrival of Lyra. Escalation is primarily internal, with one meaningful deepening when the “filter not magnify” idea alters her tactic. Cost is present but understated; external opposition remains off‑stage, so pressure relies on resolve and loss rather than confrontation. The resolution is earned via renunciation and re‑aimed craft rather than a hard reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (accept forbidden knowledge or refuse) tightens as the journal scripts her, then breaks when she finds reprieve, culminating in a binary with cost. The narrowing is driven by her choices, not coincidence. The price—self‑alteration and loss of the safer identity—is legible. Pressure coheres without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are legible early (the traveler’s disintegration) and tighten with the paradox constraint that forbids direct intent. The decisive deepening occurs when Elara reorients from hunting to surrender, narrowing tactics to an internal audit that the world answers. The price is felt but somewhat soft-focus, with the rescue achieved smoothly after the turn. Still, pressure coheres and escalates appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (wholeness) is clear and tightens via the logbook discovery and the apparition at the bow. The key turn is self-recognition: accepting the chimera truth forces renunciation of the external search. The cost is the loss of the reassuring illusion of a separate brother, paid in the quiet “no grand reunion.” Agency is evident in her methodical search and final act of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the erased history—remains coherent throughout, and tension tightens as Elara chooses delicate reconfiguration over force. Escalation is primarily intellectual and textural rather than oppositional. The choice is consequential, but immediate price is muted. Still, the merge action creates an undeniable turn.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—overcoming the hum—and tightens via a purposeful method culminating in the “single, perfect note.” The opposition (pervasive hum) is credible but passive; no reversal tests commitment beyond persistence. The felt price is modest; success comes on the first tactic without a failed beat. Still, the deepening from whisper to ice‑amplified hush is effective under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake escalates cleanly: seek a meaningful confluence, face apparent failure, then transform the goal. The meaningful tightening is the rare celestial convergence; the micro‑reversal is the prism’s initial deadness before new function. Agency is present but quiet; the visible price remains conceptual rather than felt pain, keeping this just shy of higher bands. Coincidence is the test, not the solve, per the piece’s thesis.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: whether her custodial work can constitute an identity. Escalation deepens texturally—from external whispers to an internal whisper—forcing a stance crystallization. The cost is implicit but legible: acceptance of a circumscribed life and the path not taken. A clear tightening occurs when her own past voice complicates her method.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (“cleanse” the atmosphere) is established and tightened by the sudden wave of doubt that forces a recommitment. The meaningful turn is her decision to light the fuse despite the absolute darkness and silence. Prices are primarily emotional/psychic, but they modulate tactics (soft thump, color match) and crystallize stance. No extraneous threads dilute pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (the relationship’s direction) is clear early and deepens through the vision’s branching futures. The tightening comes via newly revealed options rather than external pressure; the cost is conceptual, not yet paid. Still, the third‑path stance feels like a real narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—facing the silence of inversion without returning to bunker‑instincts—is clear. Escalation tightens from anticipatory hush to physical inversion to an interior test when she must open her eyes; the sprout deepens options and alters stance. The price is felt (enduring panic, renouncing the old refuge) and persists in the sprout. The pressure arc is more buoyant than bruising, but it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—can a deliberate hush reconfigure a frayed mind—tightens as environmental pressure (residual train hum, city din) gives way to engineered quiet. The turn arrives as the crystals coalesce and the man’s posture and breath change; Elara’s agency in pacing and demonstration drives it. The cost is present but low‑heat (Elara’s return to noise rather than a tradeoff that bites on the page). Still, the escalation reads clean and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake—reach the stairway before sunrise—tightens through the mural excavation and the step into the vortex. The meaningful turn is the sally through the portal and the final release of the ruby to signal others. Escalation is coherent but soft; obstacles yield with competence and the price paid is more renunciation than loss. Still, agency drives each beat and the final stance is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—entry predicated on learning to breathe in void—tightens into a concrete suffocation trial. The pressure coheres and escalates from plea to physical oppression to breakthrough, with Elara’s agency driving the turn. Cost is felt; panic peaks before release, foreclosing clinging as a tactic. A single, well-scaled intensification suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (survive and meaningfully anchor the convergence) is signaled and tightened by entering the sub and gripping the bolt. Escalation is coherent: pressure builds to near‑crush and forces a stance choice (focus on wonder vs. fear/greed). The cost is legible in body stress and the potential singularity; resolution arises from her agency, not coincidence. A single decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around uncovering the family truth, tightening as the wire’s tone sustains and the handle becomes available, then deepens with the unexpected voice/message. Escalation is primarily knowledge‑driven rather than risk‑driven, but it narrows options toward acceptance. The visible price is internal—she forecloses the legacy path by closing the ledger and walking out. The turn is quiet yet credible at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early (repeat old play vs. step into possibility). Escalation is delivered through the sequence of clasps—each release deepens tremors and synchronizes with the greenhouse “breathing.” The price is mostly a renunciation rather than a concrete loss, which softens impact slightly, but agency drives the peak turn.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (can meaning and kindness be recovered from the unknown?) is clear and tightens once through the dust‑inference beat to the reveal. Pressure coheres without melodrama; the reversal is knowledge‑based and earned by Silas’s agency. The emotional price—choosing to bear ongoing ache while continuing the work—reads on the page. Stakes are quiet but felt and scaled well to length.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are coherent and narrowing: loss of the dead-drop forces improvisation; retrieval raises risk; searchlight adds a ticking pursuit. The decisive choice—run along the lagoon and drop into the culvert—forecloses safety for mission integrity with legible cost. Pressure remains situationally consistent and grows without soft resets. A single additional price (e.g., minor injury or tool loss) might have intensified consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are dominant and legible from the outset: avert ruin by a precise musical counter. Pressure coheres and tightens when light strikes, with the threatened spectrum as a concrete escalation and the method narrowed to “negative space.” Resolution is earned through her practiced tactic and timed execution, with the cost of ongoing vigilance. The conflict is quiet but not static.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on the meaning of the leaves versus the demand to enact them; escalation arrives when the final leaf reframes her role from reader to sower. The choice forecloses a path (cataloging), with agency driving the turn (she plants). Pressure is coherent but gentle, with minimal on‑page resistance or loss beyond identity trade. The cadence shift is clear and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding breathable pockets to seed a future—is legible and escalates from omen‑reading to subterranean discovery to an actionable plan. The key tightening is her decision to follow the “pattern” and descend, culminating in a redefinition of tactics. Pressure remains coherent, though external jeopardy stays low and the price of the turn is primarily conceptual. A single concrete loss or risk on the page would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—redefining Kael and her failure—tightens through the ritual’s intensification and the golden vein pivot. The tear-triggered bloom is a meaningful deepening that changes her options/knowledge. The final choice to leave and speak to the village forecloses continued search as a live path. Pressure remains more meditative than strenuous, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (free the soul from sorrow by provoking laughter) are legible from the outset and tighten when Elara chooses to amplify, not fix, dissonance. The pressure escalates credibly as the wrongness wave risks failure or harm while she keeps tuning. The cost remains soft—no stark trade‑off—but agency clearly drives the turn. Resolution follows from her tactic, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake—transmuting pain into mercy—tightens as he moves from survival to reckoning at the pedestal. Pressure escalates through bodily cost and a momentary scare (the fox) that deepens his tactic of patterning. The final renunciation carries a felt price but avoids a sharp trade‑off. Still, sentence‑ and beat‑level tension is consistent and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (re‑anchoring intuition/honoring hidden histories) is signaled early and tightens when the narrator chooses to “unfasten” the moment. Escalation is largely internal and accumulative, peaking at the activation and “eternal instant.” The cost is felt but not sharply priced on the page, so tension never fully bites. Still, agency at the climax is clear and resolves the pressure credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure deepens via discovery rather than direct opposition; the ghost’s urgency narrows options toward the ceiling and safe. The tightening is clear and singular, with each find reweighting choices. Stakes remain intimate (free this spirit; restore the mechanism), and resolution depends on Leo’s agency. Cost is subdued but present as a relinquishment of the ghost and the end of a long‑kept secret.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressures escalate coherently: from deliberate rupture to library‑wide destabilization to a simultaneous‑everything crescendo. The tightening forecloses a path—perfection is irretrievably lost—and tests Elara’s commitment. Agency is concentrated in a single, risky action that carries systemic consequences. The cost is felt in the destabilized catalog and the library’s groan, even as she embraces it.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (reframing the civilization against Aris’s thesis) is clear and tightened by the storm’s peak and the shard’s interpretive turn. Escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than hard reversal, appropriate to the lens, culminating in her decision to present a eulogy rather than a counterattack. The price is internal (renunciation of a combative frame) and lands, though it’s relatively gentle. One solid tightening beat (storm peak → translation decision) carries the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: cleanse a dishonesty poisoning the song. Pressure tightens when the shadow touches her and the only viable tactic is the dangerous tether. The cost is legible (physical collapse risk; spiritual nausea) and resolved by agency rather than luck. While elegant rather than harrowing, the escalation is coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres as a deepening rather than a duel: the silence, cold, and inert compass tighten toward the moment the needle frees and points down. The decisive narrowing is a values trade—collection vs. acceptance—with real forfeiture. While danger is low, the internal stake escalates cleanly under the chosen lens. The final choice resolves the dominant question without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates coherently from physical peril to metaphysical demand, with the lantern slide as the hinge. The tightening arrives as a deepening of stakes: she forecloses her former artistic path in favor of a charged responsibility. Costs are present but soft—primarily identity and labor—rather than a sharp dilemma. Still, the hiker’s reaction confirms consequence and renewed stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates coherently from patient watching to an on-page discovery and retrieval. The dominant stake—understanding—tightens via the rare beam and the tactile risk of lifting a stone in a silent cathedral. Consequence is primarily internal and artistic, limiting the felt price. Still, the deepening of knowledge is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (“uncover the truth” vs. being trapped by trauma) is clear, with a meaningful tightening at the sentinel’s appearance. Elias’s decision to parley instead of fight or flee forecloses other paths and credibly earns access to the lagoon’s truth. The price skews internal—risking deeper entanglement—yet it registers. One sharper on‑page threat from the sentinel could have heightened cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure is primarily internal and accumulative: purpose collapse → deliberate method → irreversible activation. The decisive tightening occurs when she commits the circuit and touches every lantern, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible but understated (choosing echoes over the living). Stakes remain coherent throughout, if low on direct resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are singular and escalate cleanly from archiving to potential annihilation keyed by sound. The “perfect, terrifying harmonic” is a meaningful deepening that transforms options, forcing an ethical trade-off. The final act forecloses a path (preservation) with a palpable price (identity and record). Tension is present at sentence and beat levels without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve the inheritance before it dissipates) is established early and tightens as the new vortex frays. Escalation is a single, clean intensification—the ritual moves from gathering to stable containment—without major reversal or hard trade‑off. The price registers as effort and the return of the cold, but risk of failure feels modest because her mastery reads assured. Still, agency drives the turn and consequences reweight the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early: duty to sound the siren vs. preservation of listening/hush. Escalation tightens through the mechanical failure, the glue‑clock, and the sudden hymn at zero hour, culminating in a trade‑off that forecloses the official path. The refusal is protagonist‑driven and ethically charged, with internal and external stakes interweaving. Slight softness in explicit on‑page cost prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to meet the cosmos without betraying stillness—is signaled early and tightens through the empathic shock. The jolt is a meaningful deepening with felt price that alters tactics (he chooses ongoing vulnerable witnessing). No antagonist is needed; pressure remains coherent. Stakes skew internal but land clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate from quiet observation to a focused obligation when the ghost‑woman’s gaze and the bees’ agitation narrow his options. The decisive act (placing the box and silently “holding” understanding) resolves the pressure, but the visible price is modest. Tension is carried by pattern and implication more than by peril or trade‑off. Still, the tightening is clear and protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—meaning against erasure—tightens via the fragment discovery and the deliberate outreach method, culminating in the attic confrontation with the town’s cover‑up. The cost is felt through her physical limits and the relinquishment of “frantic counting.” Escalation is primarily deepening knowledge rather than sharp reversal, but it coheres and narrows options. Quiet, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—can quiet attentiveness soothe harm and yield meaning?—tightens when the string snaps and an animal is in distress, demanding a tactic (humming, slow approach). The reversal from thrashing to trust reads earned and reweights the morning’s “tending” into action. However, consequences are gentle and the price light; no trade‑off is forced beyond time and risk. Tension rises and resolves cleanly without multiple turns, appropriate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (forging a lasting bridge before she dies) is clear and tightens as she commits to the connection at escalating physical cost. The endurance choice forecloses her life and earns the end state. Still, opposition is largely self‑imposed; there’s little complicating pushback or reversal beyond stamina. The pressure nonetheless coheres and deepens appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (decode and undertake the “artificial pilgrimage”) tightens meaningfully at the triadic plinths, where the choice forecloses alternate paths. The amber‑as‑lens deepens options, and the fusion triggers the star map and the renewed footprints—clear progression. The price is mostly internal (abandoning skepticism as armor) and could register more sharply. Still, the escalation reads coherent and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (renewal vs. desolation) is signaled early and tightens when the starving bird forces a trade‑off. The decisive adaptation—sacrificing precious pods and changing the method to include creatures—narrows options with a real cost. Tension is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. Escalation is single‑turn and effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure grows via discovery density rather than antagonism: the whisper, the riddle, the hush, the find, the projection. Stakes remain intimate and consistent, but costs are low‑friction—Silas never faces a meaningful risk or trade‑off beyond solitude. Escalation reads as one clean tightening, adequate for the length but not searing. Resolution is earned through his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reclaim orientation/purpose—tightens with the lodestar glimpse that shifts the ritual into defiance and reframes mapping as method. Escalation is internal but coherent: she moves from hesitation to urgent reinterpretation. The cost and narrowing are more thematic than practical; no counterforce pushes back beyond isolation and the chaotic sky, which keeps the ceiling below the highest band. Still, the cadence shift is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve wonder vs. execute theft) is clear early and tightens when the apprentice wakes and names the true risk. The key turn is Elara’s pivot to open the true queen and destroy the shard, foreclosing the payday. Pressure is coherent but remains mostly moral/philosophical; tangible peril is minimal. Still, the narrowing of options reads and the outcome stems from her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s archival defiance versus silencing—tightens when Kael warns her and escalates with the pawn restoration, which converts absence into actionable potential. The price is primarily implied (surveillance, theft risk), not confronted on-page, but it’s legible enough to charge the act. The turn arises from agency rather than coincidence. A single, effective deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to endure the pain of true memory—tightens through the stone’s refusal to be edited and the eruptive decoding when touch meets texture. The turn forecloses a path (the nightly substitution) and opens a costlier one. Escalation is primarily internal but coherent and pressure-bearing for this length. A slight ease in the final acceptance keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: ending the paralysis of guilt through a new tactic. The meaningful tightening is the shift from puzzle-agitation to decoding the tapestry—linking abandoned threads to abandoned moves and pride—forcing a trade-off (surrender vs. mastery). The price is the renunciation of his prior self-concept. Quiet but clear escalation; not explosive, yet precise.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: challenge communal doctrine versus the cost of erasure. The key tightening is the Elder’s reframing—his act makes him the new sacrifice—foreclosing options and reversing his hoped‑for outcome. Agency drives escalation: his choice to perform triggers the price. The cost is unmistakable and carried to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early—salvage/transform meaning before dissolution—and pressure coherently tightens with the violent wave and gear snap. Elara’s final choice is agentic and costly, foreclosing “save the world” to achieve “redeem one thing.” The escalation reads as an accumulative intensification with a decisive beat. Minor absence of a second reversal keeps it from the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: keep the hidden promise at personal cost. Tightening arrives with the wrong turn and the decision to paint essence rather than scene, culminating in the choice to leave the art behind. The cost is conceptual and lasting (a part of herself left where she can’t return). Escalation is quiet rather than fierce but remains legible and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers out-reach shouts—tightens when the mechanism halts and then transforms, testing Elara’s ethos under risk. The decisive action (beckoning) creates the complication (dropped cork) that yields the new state. External and internal stakes marry in the trawler’s turn, though the price paid is gentle. Tension is steady rather than knife-edged, but it rises appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: align guidance under a time‑sensitive constraint or lose the night’s acuity. The meaningful tightening is the refusal to fix hydraulics and the choice to “anchor to the sky,” foreclosing an obvious path. Costs are felt more as endurance and renunciation than harm; tension is quiet but coherent and rising. A sharper on‑page risk or near‑failure beat could heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stakes—personal sanctuary vs. catastrophic amplification—tighten logically. The midpoint turn (the “cure” is a weapon) sharply deepens pressure. The arrival at the door forces a value trade‑off; the resolution forecloses a path with a felt price (sacrificing potential relief and accepting secrecy). Tension scales at sentence and beat levels without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early: decode and deliver the stranger’s message. Pressure coheres and deepens when Elias finds the cove’s Edelweiss patch, narrowing interpretation and compelling the mantelpiece choice. The cost is quiet—parting with the flower and accepting his solitude—but present. Escalation is measured rather than tense, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: remain with the known past or step into an unknown future catalyzed by a promise. Pressure coherently tightens via the rising creek, the warming chip, and the discovery that only her “W” completes the frame. The cost is mostly conceptual and slightly softened by the triumphant tone, but the narrowing of options is legible. Escalation stems from her agency at each step.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are singular and legible (mend the cosmic wound), and escalation moves from arduous climb to numinous confrontation to ritual action. However, external resistance is minimal once inside; the solution arrives via guidance rather than a pressured trade-off. The tightening occurs as her role is revealed and accepted, narrowing identity options. Cost is conceptually present but lightly felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (save/transform the pocket‑sun) is signaled early and escalates as the containment fails. The meaningful tightening is Elara’s choice to abandon containment for guided release using the shell. The outcome then unfolds without further resistance, so price and compounding pressure feel gentle. Still, agency drives the turn and the path foreclosed is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—surrender to a foregone death versus reclaiming authorship—tightens as jealousy becomes pity, and the act of writing consolidates pressure. The escalation is internal but legible, and the cost is the renunciation of a seductive, self-eroding nostalgia. The final decision is protagonist-driven and earned. Stakes remain intimate rather than peril-driven, but they read potent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal—recovering vocation/identity—and pressure coheres as Hemlock’s story tightens from object to ethos. The deepening occurs when the clamp’s precise tension reframes Elara’s loss and compels a new tactic (touch/intention). The cost is clear, though escalation stays quiet and may read slightly guided by Hemlock’s wisdom rather than a hard test. Still, the cadence shift is decisive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens via two decisive pressures: the ticking breath-clock and the crystalization threatening to rupture the rune. The turn—reframing her flaw and shedding the crystals—narrows options and demands disciplined endurance. Cost and risk are felt in bodily jeopardy and potential failure. Resolution stems from her agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—repairing a rift and honoring the mother—tightens when apology proves insufficient, forcing Elara to risk her method. The ritual escalates pressure through sensory intensification and embodied cost (trembling, heavy air) until the chord. The price is partial and ongoing, fitting the “imperfect miracle” premise. The resolution feels earned by her agency and Leo’s nonverbal acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are high and legible (library/existence vs. cosmic forces), with one meaningful tightening as Elara initiates spiral arbitration. The conflict transforms rather than reverses; the final synthesis is earned by her definitions. Still, escalation feels low-risk—no on-page near-failure or tangible loss tests her commitment. The price lands as conceptual compromise more than experiential strain.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (restore order without shutdown) is legible early and tightens through the countdown decision. Pressure coheres as he violates sequence to save sequence, creating a clean, singular escalation. The danger is felt but not devastating; no option loss beyond the chosen risk keeps the cost moderate. Still, the decisive act is protagonist‑driven and earns resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes (save the crop; redefine safety) are signaled early and escalate with the spore cascade and clock pressure. The meaningful tightening is the choked direct route versus the stranger’s “permeable” path, which forecloses Elara’s preferred tactics. However, the decisive external act belongs to him, so agency at peak pressure skews away from the protagonist. The internal cost lands, but the external resolution’s reliance on another dampens the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Conflict escalates from abstract curiosity to a pressured test: accept or reject the father’s “religion” when the lantern multiplies possibilities. The decisive act—extinguishing the candle—forecloses a path while carrying felt cost. Internal and external threads interweave cleanly; no reliance on contrivance. The pressure is quiet but tight, appropriate to length.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether endings can be reframed—tightens with the crisis caller when Silas chooses sound over words. The escalation is an intensification of pattern rather than a reversal, apt for the lens. Felt price is subtle (the risk of silence and his continued isolation), and the narrative wisely avoids an easy fix. Still, pressure remains moderate; a slightly sharper on‑page cost would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around the ritual’s urgency and the covenant’s price, escalating through the red wash, the ancestor’s vision, and the knowledge that her life is the ink. The tightening forces a stance: continue as a mere keeper or accept being the seal. The price is acknowledged and embraced, with the blooms’ response confirming consequence. Stakes remain focused and scale appropriately to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (curing loneliness) is clear; pressure coherently rises with the astronomer’s arrival and Elara’s decision to launch the rumor. The escalation is internal and situational rather than combative, but the deepening (from supplies logistics to grace logistics) narrows her path. Cost is suggested rather than dramatized, keeping tension solid but shy of bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can she parse and carry the stillpoint) is signaled and tightened through the note‑trail culminating in the monolith. Escalation is a density increase rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens, but prices paid are soft and largely internal. The decisive deepening (knowledge given freely; compass reorients) arises from her committed attention. Lack of a sharper trade‑off keeps it just shy of high‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—redeeming/understanding the “failure” and stabilizing the station—tightens coherently as the signal clarifies. The main turn is a deepening of knowledge leading to an action that changes the field of options. The price paid is mostly internal (reframing guilt), with little external friction or counterforce at the moment of activation. Tension is steady rather than jagged, but it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are legible early (preserve/restore the world’s fragile music), and pressure coheres when the speedboat fractures the pattern. Elara adapts tactics—mapping the cacophony to find a purer sound—creating a meaningful tightening. The price registers in the bittersweet loss and solitude at the end, though the external resolution (engine dying) arrives swiftly and a touch conveniently. Still, the escalation reads as a decisive intensification consistent with the established method.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are primarily ethical and reputational, cohering around secrecy vs. public gift; tension tightens at the moment she chooses not to burn the final tapestry. Escalation is a single, meaningful deepening rather than multiple turns. Cost is legible but danger remains mostly atmospheric, not actively pressing back. The absence of a live antagonist or immediate consequence keeps the pressure strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates via the stronger pull, the ritual intensification, and the apparition’s fragile arrival. Agency is clear: she chooses to play, to risk the ache, to call. The price lands in the dissolution—connection confirmed but not kept. Pressure tightens coherently without needing antagonists or multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around a time‑boxed challenge with one meaningful tightening at the blocked T‑junction, forcing an up‑and‑in solution. Agency drives the resolution; coincidence doesn’t rescue her. The security chief’s threat remains offstage, which softens immediate stakes and cost. Escalation is present but controlled and never truly dire.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—finding a voice in silence—tightens from observation to action. The decisive deepening occurs when Elian takes the ropes and begins to speak via light; the price is effort and exposure. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A touch more jeopardy or foreclosed alternative would lift intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are focused: rescue Leo from deterministic resignation. Pressure escalates through the unorthodox public display and crystallizes in the quiet contact at the end. The cost is primarily emotional and reputational, not materially narrowing options, so the squeeze feels elegant but soft. Still, the turn—boy’s outlook reweighted—lands credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—belonging vs. imprisonment—tightens from discovery to the island’s plea, forcing the renunciation. The meaningful turn is the required detachment, which forecloses his former life with a felt cost. Pressure coheres via the whale’s call intensifying and the island trembling. Resolution is earned by Arden’s agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—authentic mourning vs mandated cheer—tightens when the turbines stop, forcing a shift from performative narration to unsheltered grief. The outdoor act is a deliberate escalation with cost (dropping the protective performance, risking detection). External pressure (re‑education) remains offstage, slightly softening perceived threat. Nonetheless, the internal price is unmistakable and carries the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (reclaiming a silenced voice; testing sacred boundaries) are clear and cohere under a single pressure. Escalation is a decisive deepening: from approach to bodily dissolution to a craft choice that forecloses a more obvious “defiance” path. The price is subtle but legible: subsuming self into the stone’s cadence and relinquishing overt victory rhetoric. The conflict remains internal and lyric rather than combative, but tightens appropriately at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on awakening the rose and Elian’s yearning to access beauty; pressure tightens as talk becomes a risky build and the pair wait for wind. The decisive beat is the note and unfurling; escalation is coherent but gentle, with little jeopardy or trade‑off beyond the barter. Agency is strong—Elian’s plan drives the turn. A clearer price or threatened failure would heighten the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are modest but coherent: revive communal connection through sound in a post‑hum world. Escalation is a single meaningful deepening—the lens insight that forecloses the broadcast path and redirects effort. The price is an identity shift and surrender of her previous craft, felt but gently rendered. Tension is quiet and accumulative rather than adversarial, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes—whether she will stay inert or transform—are clear, and the origami trail provides a tightening vector. However, pressure is gentle; resistance is minimal once Lyra appears, and obstacles are largely conceptual. The decisive act (etching, choosing a new collection) closes the question but with modest on‑page cost. Escalation reads as a deepening insight more than a trial.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are intellectual-to-civic: decode patterns to reveal purpose. Escalation is a single, clean deepening when the patterns point to her own building and the hidden journal. The pressure is coherent but gentle; there’s no real resistance, so the price reads as assumed duty rather than a hard trade‑off. Still, the narrowing from many paths to one obligation provides a credible tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are legible early (reach the Heart-Space without being undone), and pressure tightens via the failing veil and escalating psychic saturation. The deliberate refusal of patterns is a costly tactic shift that narrows options and imposes mental strain. The final act—acceptance without judgment—reads as earned endurance/renunciation. Primarily internal conflict, but it remains tense and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are focused: can she resist the soporific collective and rekindle singular hope. Escalation proceeds from archival analysis to a risky, self-authored dream; the tightening is legible and paid with exertion. The opposition is primarily entropy/complacency rather than an active force, so the path feels relatively unresisted. Still, the final act is a clear, earned commitment that reconfigures options.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: how to respond to betrayal—anger vs. care—and it tightens when she reframes “healing by shedding layers,” foreclosing vengeance. Escalation is internal but causal: the clue (tail tip) compels accountability; the repair requires precision and patience, forcing her to sit with guilt. The price—abandoning the catharsis of rage for the discipline of care—lands in the held‑breath final moment. Pressure is coherent despite a quiet external field.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake—finding meaning/healing and relieving the plants’ distress—tightens coherently from room to tunnel to intimate contact. The decisive move (pressing scars to the orb) is agent-driven and reconfigures options. The price is felt (risk to damaged arm, yielding her story to the miracle) but lightly rendered. A sharper on-page hazard could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: uncover where unused love is stored and act accordingly. Escalation is a deepening under the accumulative lens: from waiting to vision to the realization that “place” is “intended recipient,” narrowing options to delivery. The cost is elegiac rather than perilous, but it’s felt in the recognition of time lost. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens through the sleepless vigil and fear of rest until the star/voice escalation. Agency matters: she raises and aligns the sextant, then later chooses stillness over pursuit. The price is chiefly internal (abandoning the ritual of chasing) and lands, though its pain is more contemplative than acute. Pressure is coherent and deepens once decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: anomaly compels a stop, contact forces a torrent she must manage, and the choice to remain narrows her future. Stakes are legible (save/leak of potential realities) and the price—enduring custodianship—is clear. While not antagonist‑driven, internal and external conflicts interlock effectively. The escalation is a single strong deepening rather than multiple reversals, apt for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to cross and relinquish the body—is established early and escalates as the temple reveals the gateway. The unraveling functions as the single necessary tightening, transforming wonder into an irreversible decision. The price (self-shed, exile from the physical) is clear at the moment of action. Conflict remains primarily internal; a bit more resistance would sharpen pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—continue or succumb to fear—tightens at the ridgeway when the boat’s option closes. The cost is palpable: exhaustion and risk of the steep, veiled climb, countered by the star’s limited aid. Escalation is clean and coherent under the chosen lens, with the guides’ lullaby receding as he assumes agency. Stakes are intimate rather than existential but remain clear and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. imposed safety—tightens once with the secret room reveal and the architect’s confession. Escalation is primarily knowledge-deepening rather than risk-heightening; tension remains quiet. The final refusal of silence is a credible stance crystallization, but the visible price is deferred. Still, the pressure coheres under a causal lens and meaningfully narrows her moral options.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is signaled early and resolved by Elara’s chosen tactic. Escalation arrives as a single precise intensification when she applies the rune, but resistance is minimal and no option is foreclosed beyond the spent rune. The cost is present yet modest; there’s little in-scene jeopardy or reversal. The quiet dismantling is conceptually satisfying but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent: to uncover why paths disappear and what that means for his role. Pressure tightens through the puzzle work and the frantic tapping, culminating in the acceptance of irreversibility. The visible price is a sober shift from active discovery to custodial remembrance. While quiet and internal, the escalation reads and forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reigniting a paralyzed rebellion) is clear, and the hum/stone alignment offers a decisive tightening. Elara’s agency—choosing witness over violence and summoning the others—creates the key turn. Still, the felt price is light; risk or tradeoff isn’t pressed on the page, so pressure remains more spiritual than perilous. Tension works but doesn’t bite.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—awake the embryo in defiance of the council—tightens through decoding and the ritualized unsealing. The decisive act is hers, but the price (political or personal risk) stays prospective rather than enacted, keeping tension just shy of peak severity. The internal vs external conflict interweaves well via harmony vs force. The cadence shift at the amber’s dissolution and immediate sprout works as the meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (regain the present to keep tending/being) is signaled early and tightened by the overhead jet and freeze, which forecloses flight. The counter-move—grounding through bark and breath—constitutes agency with a felt price. Resolution is earned by a stance crystallization rather than convenience or miracle.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (survive/understand crushing despair) is signaled and tightened by the enclosing walls. Escalation comes through a focused shift: redesigning fragments instead of repairing, culminating in a risky, non‑intuitive pairing (Tower fall through Star). The price is endurance rather than relief—she keeps the ache but transforms it into working light. Stakes remain mainly internal, which slightly limits raw pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understand time’s dilation—is clear early; pressure tightens through the experiment and her last-vial constraint. The decisive deepening is the sigil and realization that reweights options, narrowing her path to renunciation. Cost is legible (tools and prior project abandoned; self-dissolution chosen). Tension is internal but sustained and escalatory under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—order versus truth—tightens when she bypasses reporting to awaken the network, foreclosing her safest path. The waiting beat with no alarms, then the chime cascade, functions as a single deepening that makes the risk real. The price is moral and professional exposure rather than immediate punishment, but it’s unmistakable in the charged stillness afterward.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve a nonviolent sanctuary—clarifies early and tightens with the airlock breach and armed entry. The key turn is the enforced sheathing, which forecloses immediate violence and affirms Elara’s ethic. Prices are mostly conceptual/emotional; we don’t see a hard loss, but the risk and renunciation are clear. Tension sustains through to the gift of the rose, though escalation remains single‑step.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is explicit early and pressure coheres toward the instability apex. The meaningful tightening arrives at the momentary cessation of the hum; his method must be silence, not force. The cost reads as internal burden rather than a tangible loss, which keeps the escalation strong but not searing. Resistance (“moth resisting a flame”) gives a credible final test of will.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus legacy—pressurizes through a single, meaningful deepening: she assumes the opposite and tests it, narrowing options once proof appears. The cost is explicit: dismantling her inheritance via confession. Internal and external strands mesh; tension tightens rather than widens. A slight ease in the discovery phase softens pressure but the final trade‑off is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (break the loop/hush guilt) is clear and tightens through the letter reveal and the risky redirection of the cry. The decisive act forecloses a path (feeding back into the system) and carries cost (imprisoning a sound; personal confrontation with the cry). Pressure rises coherently, if elegantly rather than brutally. Slightly low friction—her solution works on the first try—keeps it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: transform collective unease into understanding; escalation tightens when the arguing pair enters and Elara must act. The decisive act (tapping the keystone tile) halts the argument and reframes options. Costs and foreclosed paths are understated—no sharp sacrifice beyond the choice to speak through silence—keeping the pressure strong but not searing. Still, the cadence shift is clear and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (erasure vs. preservation/mercy) is clear and tightens when the lieutenant issues the order. The retrocognitive surge deepens internal pressure, culminating in Elara’s public defiance and protective renaming. The price is visible in social risk and potential punishment, though not paid on the page. Tension scales cleanly without gratuitous reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—relief from trapped grief—tightens as echoes intensify to the rigging failure, then narrows to Leo’s anchoring choice. The price is Elara’s letting go of her encore impulse and existence within the maze; it reads as a meaningful relinquishment. Escalation is internal and accumulative but clear, with one strong cadence shift at the climax. The conflict is quiet yet cohesive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (breaking the creative block to reveal hidden pathways) is clear, and escalation is a single, meaningful tightening through embodied memory guiding craft. The turn is agency‑driven (choosing the pill; choosing to wire the geode and move). The felt price remains relatively gentle—no foreclosed path beyond epistemic control—keeping pressure strong but not searing. The resolution is earned and coherent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—giving the unknown a voice—is signaled early, and pressure coheres as calm readings give way to crimson overload and the floating fossil. The decisive tightening is her choice to translate emotion to sound and embody it. Still, the conflict is largely internal and low‑friction; costs and foreclosed options are more inferred than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stakes (time halting vs. renewal) are legible early and tighten as the upper bulb empties and the echo coheres. Escalation is accumulative, culminating in a single committed act that forecloses inaction. The felt cost is modest—she sacrifices the entire catalog and the contained echo—but resistance is largely conceptual, keeping tension elegant rather than visceral. Still, the decisive flip is protagonist-driven and earned by prior patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—trust/honor under immediate threat—tightens with the operative’s arrival, forcing a high‑risk stance rather than retreat. The decisive act (open palms, revealing the phoenix) forecloses safer paths with visible danger. Internal and external pressures interlock cleanly; the cost is present even as the nod resolves the standoff. Slightly soft in portraying immediate consequence beyond posture shift.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—honoring a vow by discerning what must be returned—tightens credibly as sensory pressure shifts from ticking to river voice. The decisive act (returning the vellum) forecloses a path with a real loss for Linnea. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens; the live clock is the key tightening. Lack of a sharper internal contest keeps stakes more contemplative than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused on understanding/preserving: the fracture forces a new tactic (use glass, revise vessel). The pressure escalates coherently as the thrum intensifies and time splinters, then tightens into a single decisive making choice. The cost is understated but present; a slightly sharper friction or counter‑pull (e.g., a risk in misreading) could heighten consequence. Still, the knitting of timelines after his act reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the dropped petal serves as clock, grief → ritual → invention → starfield. The meaningful tightening occurs when she plants the gauge and commits to a non‑plant “fixture,” risking failure against the hush. Stakes are internal but concrete; the price is living with absence reconfigured, not erased. Escalation is subtle rather than dramatic, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (purpose vs. loneliness) is established early and tightens as deciphering fails, then the tide‑triggered event raises the stakes into a clear choice. The reversal—sundial as key, library as vessel—credibly changes options. Cost is present conceptually (abandoning the mausoleum role) but not strongly felt on the page. Still, agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on whether she remains a hidden conduit or risks public connection; escalation is chiefly textural, culminating in the live unveiling. Pressure is coherent but gentle; there’s no counterforce beyond her own hesitation. The decisive act (lighting the installation) lands but feels low‑risk on the page. A beat of resistance—ethical risk, social pushback—would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    One dominant stake is clear (inoculate a divided community), and pressure tightens through the “nothing happens” beat before the tone confirms success. Agency drives the turn; however, the escalation is relatively smooth, with no secondary cost or forced trade-off beyond fatigue. The psychological warfare premise raises stakes, but on-page tension is more poised than fraught. Earned, if low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the archive/overcoming spatial pressure—is set early and meaningfully tightens when the organ note pins the blueprint and requires immediate, precise action. The key reversal is the realization that the compass point is the literal key, leading to deliberate insertion. However, danger feels controlled and success comes without a palpable sacrifice beyond fear, moderating escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reopen the case to awaken empathy) is legible and tightens via the method that yields the twin hypothesis. The meaningful turn occurs when opposites unify and reweight the suspect pool, prompting the decision to go to police. The cost is internal rather than tactical; external opposition is minimal, which softens escalation. Tension sustains but remains largely contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring the ancestor’s name—stays tight and escalates from research to desecration to the charged declaration. The beat where “nothing happens” before the air tightens offers a brief reversal that tests commitment. The price is largely emotional and ethical, not materially grinding, keeping pressure credible but contained. Resolution emerges from her action, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: salvage meaning from an impossible event. The meaningful tightening is the shift from seeking the man to interrogating the frame, triggered by recounting and the fiddler’s directive; this forecloses a path and raises the emotional price. The resolution is driven by Elara’s agency (new photograph, acceptance) rather than coincidence. Stakes remain intimate but felt, with cost legible in her renunciation of certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stakes (break the cycle; protect claimed space without violence) are signaled early and tightened by the intruder’s arrival. Escalation is driven by Leo’s agency: choosing intimidation via banknotes rather than fight; the intruder’s retreat reveals the method’s efficacy and sets up the renunciation. The price—leaving the strongbox empty—reads on the page. A sharper on‑page temptation beat would heighten the trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear (prevent a cataclysm, save Kael), and pressure escalates from private vigilance to urgent decoding to intervention. However, obstacles are minimal; Alaric supplies the key without resistance and the send‑message action faces no friction. The major price is conceptual rather than felt on the page. The tightening exists but doesn’t bite.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes are legible early (heal the grove/redeem failure), with a key tightening at the confession’s shatter that exposes the true core. The final choice to integrate (with its attendant moral risk) is a genuine trade‑off, not a safe option. Internal and external pressures interlock coherently under the causal lens. A touch more visible aftermath cost beyond the lake clearing could have heightened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (activate the covenant by finding the center) is signaled and tightened via a clear pattern: each link costs and clarifies, narrowing to the heart. The decisive act (handing over the now‑glowing clipping) reads as earned, with cost endured through escalating shocks and rooted pain. Stakes avoid telescopic inflation by grounding in embodied ordeal. Slight smoothness—no hard reversal beyond intensification—keeps it just shy of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are singular (mend the wound/destiny debt) and escalate coherently as the entity tightens its hold. The decisive tightening arrives at the heart where she must choose grace over force and pay with memory. Pressure is protagonist‑driven and resolves via her renunciation. Stakes remain felt and avoid hollow grandiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: whether Leo remains insulated or risks purpose again. The photo inscription is a meaningful tightening that forces a stance and leads to a concrete choice (searching venues). Cost is interior but credible. Escalation is measured rather than sharp, keeping this shy of the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is internal and coherent: the failure, the abandoned gift, and the broken arbor force a re-evaluation. The analogical insight tightens options from “repair/force” to “nurture/wait,” with a clear price. Tension is quiet, but the trade-off is legible and consequential for this scope. A single deepening—fruit as rupture—credibly drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (integrate and preserve a life’s wonder) tightens under the waxing moon’s pressure, compelling the smelting action. The ritual introduces a clear deepening—“violent act made serene”—with the basket’s dissolution as an irreversible price. Internal and external pressures interlock credibly. The tension remains quiet but grows coherently to the bead’s coalescence and shelving.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake is internal—certification of isolation vs. acknowledgment of human connection—signaled early and deepened by the confessional device. Pressure coheres and tightens at the niche and the “heartbeat” beat. Cost is emotional/identity‑level rather than external; it’s present but not heavily stress‑tested by countervailing forces. Still, the escalation is sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: self‑forgiveness versus self‑punishment. Pressure deepens through concrete turns: decoding coordinates, confessing on the wall, receiving the anonymous message, then risking music—each narrows the emotional options. The price is exposure and the abandonment of her isolating method. No antagonist is needed; internal and situational pressures cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (prove worthy, find/enter and comprehend the Library) is clear and culminates in the librarian choice. Pressure deepens via the shift from deciphering letters to decoding the watch’s mechanism, a single meaningful tightening. The price—trading the quester identity for custodianship—is present but relatively gentle on the page. No antagonist needed, but the ease of success keeps tension from spiking.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: authenticate vs. liberate the violin’s destiny. Pressure tightens decisively when the “perforated” futures reveal a fading window, forcing immediate action. External resistance is light, so the felt price remains largely internal; still, agency drives escalation to a credible trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible from the start; escalation occurs as density and focus rather than adversarial reversal, fitting the lens. The decisive act (infusion) is protagonist‑driven with a visible price (exhaustion, spent chip). Pressure remains coherent though gentle; a sharper complication could have deepened the cost. As executed, the single tightening beat is sufficient and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure accrues through discovery beats that deepen knowledge rather than via antagonist force, appropriate to the piece’s scale. The tightening is the shift from seeking peace as resolution to recognizing ongoing tending, catalyzed by the ledger. Stakes remain internal but coherent. The cost is implicit rather than dramatic, capping intensity but not undermining it.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (business betrayal vs conscience) is established early. Pressure tightens through Kael’s flinches, his dismissal and move to leave, then Elara’s mirror test that forces a re‑price of options. The renunciation is a visible narrowing; he pays by abandoning the “clean break” he sought. Stakes stay coherent and escalate via pattern intensification rather than multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are primarily epistemic: can Kael shift from erasure to redirection. Pressure coheres and intensifies through the descent and enforced silence, culminating in the reweighting at return. The cost is subtle; escalation registers more as deepening than narrowing of options, but it’s sufficient at this length. A slightly sharper on-page price would raise the band.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: preserving/understanding harmony under intrusion. Escalation coheres via a single tightening: locating and handling the source transforms the problem and narrows options (discard vs. keep vs. integrate). The price is subtle but present—he internalizes the discord and reframes duty. The quiet mode avoids reversals yet maintains pressure through discovery and stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (protect a fragile, non‑efficient magic from the guild) is signaled and tightened by the keystone’s fading glow. The decisive turn is Elian’s shift from discovery to protection via low‑tech means, trading comfort and affiliation for stewardship. Pressure coheres under the causal lens; the cost (endurance, cold, isolation) is visible. Lack of an on‑page antagonist keeps it quiet but doesn’t flatten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens via the hum intensifying, the perilous end of the pier, and the choice to descend and then to “listen.” The escalation is primarily deepening knowledge rather than narrowing survival options; stakes remain internal but legible. The decisive act—placing his hand into the sphere—earns the turn. A clearer felt price (risk, renunciation, or foreclosed path on the page) would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding purpose versus entropy—tightens as Elara rejects observation and actively composes. The dice‑selected chord creating a fundamental constant is a meaningful pressure peak and payoff. Prices are largely internal and conceptual; no antagonistic force, but the pressure of cosmic finality coheres. The escalation is clean and character‑driven, if a touch abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are primarily internal—can he transform his role to honor fear and sacrifice—and they tighten via the progressive crystallizations toward the selfless bell. The sunset window and mounting emotional/energetic strain provide a credible deepening. Costs are felt more conceptually than materially but register on the page. A single decisive intensification (the bell) fulfills the lens’s requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (rekindle the oceans’ song) is clear and tightened by the still sea and failed prior attempts. Escalation is a deepening: from futile force to precise, patient engineering of rhythm; options narrow to one fragile method. Cost registers as stamina, risk of failure, and surrender of control, though it remains understated. The final bell strike is a decisive act that earns the abyssal answer.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to respond to the resurfacing past—tightens from professional documentation to personal reckoning. The key deepening arrives when the bottle unlocks familial memory, leading to the decision to carry the town’s story rather than erase it. Cost is legible as burden and grief; no external antagonist is needed under this lens. Escalation is quiet but coherent, with one meaningful turn (camera to heart-keeping).

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (proving harmony of logic and intuition) is signaled early and tightens through a single decisive deepening: choosing to warm air rather than force melt. Escalation is primarily textural rather than adversarial, consistent with the lens. The visible price is limited to surrendering control and composure; no real foreclosed alternative beyond “force it,” which she wisely declines. Tension is real but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens meaningfully at the buckle’s failure, forcing a novel, risk‑bearing solution and the sacrifice of the pod. The waiting beat amplifies stakes without dissipating agency. One decisive turn suffices at this length and the cost is legible. Slight remove in the offstage resolution trims peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (overcome numbness via custody/integration) and tightens when the memory-barrage forces a stance. The key turn—choosing to contain then welcome the storm—narrows options by sacrificing his anesthetic shield. Cost is visible (tears, relived grief/joy) and directly earned by his agency. No extraneous reversals dilute the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are legible early (innovation vs. suppression) and escalate when the hunters arrive and race the rooms. However, the chase and confrontation are mostly observed via monitors and summary, softening tension and price. The key tightening—decoy vault vs. buried seed—works but avoids a visceral test at the threshold. The price paid remains conceptual rather than felt in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular and legible: reclaim laughter. Pressure tightens through the crescendo and culminates in the reversal when an off‑screen absence becomes on‑page presence via giggle. Silas’s agency drives escalation (initiation, conducting, cut to silence), and he pays with exertion and emotional exposure. The cadence shift (roar to silence to laughter) functions as the decisive tightening under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—stabilize the eroding archive (and by echo, her disquiet)—is signaled early and tightened when the guardian interiorizes the garden and shows the failing boundary. The decisive throw narrows options and resolves pressure through agency. The price is more conceptual than visceral, and the scene avoids sharper complications that could have tested her resolve further. Still, the escalation reads coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—interrupt the stifling destiny—tightens via successive approximation with one meaningful deepening at the “cold unweaving” attempt. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, and the reversal (from additive to subtractive) narrows options toward an all‑or‑nothing annihilation. Cost is legible but more thematic than visceral. The final act (offering the void a choice) reads as a committed, high‑stakes step.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—isolating the signal/finding a beginning—tightens through a decisive tactic shift (powering down, stripping filters) and a visible price (discarding the shard). There’s no antagonist, but coherent pressure escalates as options narrow from “more” to “less.” The final tuning is a clear agency move that crystallizes stance. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reconciling timelines—tightens coherently from thinning passengers to a shipless void to the grotto decision. The decisive turn (“Turn it”) is protagonist-driven, but the path is relatively low-friction and risk-light. There’s little visible price or foreclosed option beyond the abstract burden of understanding. Tension is steady rather than intensifying toward a sharp cost.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: integrate a traumatic memory or face what resists integration. Escalation is protagonist‑driven (she forces pattern B), culminating in the eruption that forecloses her tidy model. The cost is legible (failed commission, broken tool, shaken worldview) and reweights options. Stakes stay personal and focused, without extraneous complications.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (embracing an expanded cosmology) tightens when Elias reframes navigation and relinquishes the anchor as a command to risk drift. Escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than a hard turn; the pressure coheres but remains mostly internal and pedagogical. The visible price is acceptance of uncertainty and responsibility, not a tangible sacrifice. Effective, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (release the spirit by uncovering buried proof) is signaled early and tightened by the fading signal and fragmented whisper. Escalation proceeds through a meaningful deepening: from static to plea to discovery, narrowing options as the voice dissolves. The cost is a commitment rather than loss, but it reweights the final image. Lack of a counterforce beyond entropy keeps pressure from peaking higher.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes are survival vs fidelity to the mission; the meaningful tightening arrives with the tidal shift collapsing the way out. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn—choosing an experimental, identity‑risking extraction rather than a physical escape. The price is implicit but legible: accepting the unknown risks of phase transition and abandoning the site’s remains. Pressure remains coherent and escalates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim meaning from failure—tightens through the painful memory‑autopsy to the single pulsing point of light. The cost is felt (psychic agony, the relinquished heartbeat ritual), and the closure arises from Elias’s agency. Pressure stays coherent without external antagonists, a fit for this length and lens. A bit more tactical jeopardy midstream could have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—saving a culture’s essence—pressurizes through the diamond’s curse escalating into the threat of psychic and physical shattering. The larger flock provides a counter‑pattern that enables a strategic pivot, narrowing options from “pure sound” to “embraced dissonance.” The price is felt in strain and in relinquishing an ideal of purity. Resolution clearly results from the protagonist’s altered stance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes cohere around whether she resists or surrenders to the reconfigured physics; the tightening arrives as gravity and static converge on her. The choice to “let it pull her apart” forecloses her prior life and resolves the internal conflict. Pressure escalates clearly, though a secondary external counterforce isn’t present (appropriate at this length). The price is unmistakable and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates when statues twitch and the oldest tree begins to move. Pressure rises through a single, meaningful deepening (from shell vibration to systemic uprooting). Opposition is present but soft—the statues never actively counter—so risk and cost feel low for Elara. Even so, the transformation forecloses the prior stasis with tangible consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—trading contraband for a lead on a missing child—is clear, with a single effective tightening when Kael withholds payment to force terms. The visible price is the rare bottle surrendered; risk is implied by the border drone network. Escalation is understated and could push further, but pressure remains coherent and grows to the chip reveal. Resolution feels earned rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on whether Elara remains a scavenger or becomes the finisher of a haunted work; escalation is a density increase (bells → glowing fragment → vision) that culminates in her choice to carve. The singing reweights the situation and narrows options toward acceptance of responsibility. The price remains mostly implied, not directly felt on page. Still, the tightening is credible and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—discovery versus duty—tightens through the transformation and is tested by the student’s need, forcing Elara to renounce immediate immersion. The scarf’s finite “memory” registers a price, closing off one path and clarifying a new role. Escalation is gentle rather than harrowing, but coherent under the chosen lens. A touch more on‑page resistance or risk would heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are coherent (catch the fleeing dream; decode longing) and escalate at the pivotal morning’s “desperate cry,” prompting a risked departure from her usual method. The meaningful tightening is her choice to abandon paper and target the dead lens. The price is mainly the emptied palette and the end of the whispers—felt but gentle. Lack of resistance or counterforce keeps pressure lower than the language suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is crisp: liberate the client’s idea from fear. Pressure tightens through disorientation and the sentient lock, culminating in the barrier’s soft dissolution. The locksmith’s agency drives the turn, but resistance is light and largely unopposed, softening the felt cost. Still, the cadence shift from knot to star reads as a meaningful escalation under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—recover the missing memory—and deepens through the investigative turning points. The key tightening is the recognition that the ring is “wrong,” forcing a new tactic (broken constellation mapping). The price is primarily emotional rather than physical, credible at this length. External jeopardy is minimal, but the internal escalation lands.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile—is explicit and pressured by Elara’s refusal to allow retreat. The escalation tightens at the memory immersion and her command to stay, culminating in the annotation choice. Cost is present but modest; the confrontation resolves smoothly once the method is set. One meaningful tightening is achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates when her attempt drains her and the connection threatens to snap. The turn—choosing to give rather than capture—narrows options and exacts a personal price that reweights the outcome. Tension coheres without an external antagonist; internal and external pressures interlock. A touch more risk or irreversible loss would intensify the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—laying the spirit to rest—is signaled early and deepened when the drowning man appears, tightening the pressure. The decisive tightening occurs with the final thread coming free, transforming the net from weapon to harmless weave. Cost is primarily emotional and ethical (expose malice, honor the break) rather than material, but it’s legible. Escalation is steady and coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—uncover and decide how to treat the hidden space—tightens through the flicker discovery and the opening. The key reversal is internal: from pursuit of knowledge to protective secrecy, with a clear cost to her professional impulse. Pressure escalates credibly under the causal lens via her deliberate methods rather than external antagonists. The ending’s choice forecloses future options.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing a stubborn soul and reconfiguring Elara’s stance—tightens once she commits to the untangling method. The escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal; the release is achieved without missteps or counterpressure. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of her earlier worldview and the quiet of the soul’s departure. The conflict remains elegant but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (voice the ghost or it remains adrift; Elara’s voice remains trapped), and escalation arrives with the plate’s activation and memory flood, culminating in the lightning strike. Agency drives the turn: she chooses to encode and completes it. The pressure feels more ceremonial than contested, with minimal risk or loss on the page. A sharper tradeoff or complication would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can Kael kindle joy in the new resident—tightens via the ticking floors and the diary’s partial opacity until the penthouse test. The decisive beat is the unfolding of the meal wrapper and silent offering of tools. Escalation is gentle but coherent under an accumulative/causal blend. The cost is modest, but the narrowing of options (speak vs. enact) is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (to complete the record vs. survival) is signaled early and deepens as hours and cold press in. The meaningful tightening is her renunciation of being found as primary, betting everything on finishing the dataset. The beacon arrives after her internal resolve, preserving agency. Costs are felt but not punishingly explicit, keeping the escalation at strong rather than searing.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres: time is running out; he must locate and then execute the lens under a precise dawn angle. The key escalation is the projection’s failure under the rising sun, which forces a costly choice to renounce preservation. Stakes remain focused on capturing the uncapturable. A small mid‑scene loss or trade‑off earlier could have heightened the tightening further.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (restart the airship) is clear, and pressure coheres under the causal lens. The meaningful tightening is Elara converting pattern into a playable sequence under time‑social pressure. However, there’s little opposition or cost and the solution works without setback, muting escalation. The violinist’s success lacks a test that would foreclose an option or force a trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (repair the paused moment) is legible, but escalation is gentle: discovery → unlock → assemble without setbacks or costs that narrow options. The mirror selves prompt understanding, but pressure doesn’t test resolve on the page. The final click reweights the scene, yet tension seldom bites.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (save the trees/community) is signaled early and escalates coherently: discovery and repair give way to “too little, too late,” forcing a costly final act. The reversal from triumph to insufficiency is effective and narrows options to sacrifice. Slight softening comes from the quasi‑deus‑ex nebula, though it is earned by Elara’s agency. The price—her dissolution—reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (avert midnight) is clear and escalates through the frantic mechanism and isolating hush. The meaningful tightening is the choice to sing a correction rather than manipulate gears, narrowing options and converting cost into personal expenditure. The resolution is protagonist-driven and does not rely on coincidence. Pressure could show one more explicit loss or risk, but the emotional price reads.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake (end the curse/save travelers) escalates coherently: immediate rescue pressure, then the higher wager at the node. The tightening is protagonist‑driven and forecloses a path—she risks death and relinquishes her identity as caretaker. The price is clear though not dwelt upon, and tension runs sentence to scene. A sharper moment of potential failure at the stump could have intensified cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (how to live with grief) is signaled early and tightens when foam patterns reframe separation as connection. Escalation is internal but coherent; the decisive turn forecloses the self-punishment path in favor of integration. The price—releasing the rigidity that protected him—is felt, if understated. A brief on-page resistance beat could have heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are singular (find where her story begins/validate existence) and the tightening arrives when pattern aligns into “a forgiveness not granted.” Pressure escalates primarily via density and focus rather than opposition. The emotional price is implied more than felt on the page; neither character faces a hard tradeoff beyond recognition. The turn is graceful but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular and clear: rescue the boy without being consumed. Escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven: analysis outside → ritual weakening → brutal internal battle. The price is explicit and enduring, not a reset. A true reversal is absent, but one meaningful tightening/deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore the city’s shared rhythm—is signaled early and coheres. Escalation is gentle: diagnosis → retrieval → recalibration, with a decisive tightening at the installation and sung binding. Cost is present but light; there’s little foreclosure beyond effort and responsibility taken. The accumulative lens supports the cadence shift, but the scene avoids harder trade‑offs or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (risking self to retrieve entangled memory) is clear and tightens when the device floods her with another mind’s emotions. The key deepening beat is her decision to tweak the interface to let the current carry her—an escalation of commitment. The price is primarily internal (identity shift, emotional inundation) rather than a foreclosed external option, which keeps pressure strong but not punishing. Solid, not blistering.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is live from the outset and tightens credibly as tremors, flickering fungi, and the narrowing window force bolder moves. The leap across the threshold under collapsing inversion is a strong earned test; cost is danger/time rather than moral trade-off, but it’s legible and escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is plain and present: to create music in a mute world. Escalation tightens from inert tool to embodied listening to the first note to orchestral swell. The reversal—insulator as inert object → insulator as strummed key—derives from Aris’s altered tactic. The price is mostly risk of failure and self‑expenditure rather than a concrete loss, keeping the ceiling modest.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (prevent catastrophic failure “before the next phase”) is clear, and pressure tightens toward the final act as patterns grow erratic and the phase approaches. Escalation is largely accumulative via observation density rather than reversal; the decisive move is singular and unopposed. The cost feels muted—relief with a bittersweet undertone—so tension resolves smoothly. Still, the beat structure coheres and deepens options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—opening the diary—tightens through iterative failures, the approaching festival (clock), and the reframed tactic based on empathy. The meaningful turn is her reorientation from mechanics to essence, which narrows options and raises internal cost. Resolution is earned by her agency; coincidence (fireworks) accents but does not resolve. Stakes remain intimate but palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: initial failure, a calming tactic found (doodling), a storm that could disrupt but instead reframes, then the high-cost bloom acceptance. The meaningful tightening is her choice to stop forcing and endure the rot, foreclosing her prior path of control. Cost is felt (breathing “profound decay”) and the internal conflict resolves through renunciation rather than conquest. Stakes remain intimate but are sufficiently pressurized for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (find the source) tightens into a moral trade‑off as the window closes. The decisive pressure point is the discovery’s demonstration (moss growth) under a time limit; the choice to leave the arrow costs possession/credit. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. One more on‑page complication could have further sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake (stop the town’s catatonia) escalates through data accumulation to a focused approach and decisive act. The tightening is coherent under the Causal lens, with the wind-map revelation narrowing options to a single high-pressure locus. The price reads mostly as situational hazard rather than a tough trade-off, so pressure feels slightly safe. Still, agency—especially the final physical intervention—drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (prove wonder’s necessity) is signaled early and escalates via increasing sonic/light intensity toward the pillar’s transformation. The meaningful tightening arrives as she commits to the final white note, risking the unknown. Pressures remain coherent, but opposition is largely environmental/abstract; no counterforce tests her resolve beyond execution. Cost lands, though softly, which tempers the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (learn safely and return) tightens when the memory‑shadow lunges for the tether, forcing a keeper’s response. Escalation is coherent under a causal lens and resolved by Elara’s chosen method, not coincidence. The price is mainly conceptual and reputational (rejecting command in favor of humility) with a brief external risk; danger dissipates quickly, tempering felt cost. Still, the tether’s vulnerability and sealing note credibly narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: can he pursue quantification without dissolving his self. Pressure coheres and escalates via his deliberate ambiguity, which triggers the flood and forces the costly release choice. The final stance—enduring authentic feeling without borrowed buffers—narrows his path going forward. A clear tightening beat and legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: complete the delivery and discover its meaning. The pressure tightens when waiting yields to active risk (handling the pendant) and then deepens with the reveal that reweights the job. The cost is quiet (endurance and renunciation rather than clash) but it forecloses a prior path. Escalation is internal/external in sync and consistent with a situational/accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—prove objects hold emotions—tightens as the tree’s crack escalates pressure and redefines the field. Agency is clear in her renunciation of the prism to touch the tree; that choice forecloses the smaller battle for a larger truth. The felt price is the surrender of defensive pride and tool‑mediated certainty. Tension remains coherent without requiring a second reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake (deliver the message) is signaled early; escalation arrives via the bead’s stabilizing effect and the puzzle‑frame method, culminating in the sacrifice of the finished work. The cost is unmistakable and chosen by the protagonist. Pressure is gentle rather than urgent, but it coheres and tightens appropriately for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save Kael without surrendering her mind—is signaled early and tightened by the “terrible bargain.” Escalation is coherent: the discovery reframes the problem; the workaround demands ingenuity and a real forfeit. Pressure growth is steady rather than jagged, but the moral calculus sharpens credibly at the core turn. The resolution is earned by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear early: uncover the withheld truth; pressure intensifies through repeated, warmer jumps and mental erosion. The meaningful tightening is the final desperate jump yielding the older man and confession. Agency primarily manifests in her tactic to redirect focus, with cost shown in exhaustion and risk of failure. Resolution edges toward convenience (confession), but it still feels earned by her persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore the light before the ship arrives—is signaled early and coherently escalates through discovery to action. The meaningful tightening comes when Elvan recognizes the warning cairns and moves from witness to actor. The cost is chiefly vocational/psychic, not bodily, but it’s legible. No reversal beyond that shift, yet sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear (a galleon’s survival) with escalation from routine to crisis when the ship ignores the beam. The tightening beat is Silas’s loss of conventional tactic and the compulsion to laugh, forcing a nontraditional solution. Resolution is earned via the helmsman’s risky steer into darkness reweighted by Silas’s laugh. The price is more thematic than material, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding her relation to stories—tightens through the light-drawing demonstration and the revelation of the donor’s perceptual signature. Pressure is quiet but coherent: the master’s action reweights Elara’s options from seeking to listening. The cost (accepting the donor’s life within her) is legible, though external consequence is minimal. Escalation is a single decisive deepening rather than multiple turns.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve vs deconstruct) is signaled early and tightens through a single decisive intensification at the pin/moonlight beat. The internal conflict (obedience vs restoration) and external pressure (directive, storm) interweave. The resolution is protagonist‑driven; however, the price is mostly conceptual, with limited on‑page consequence for defiance. Escalation remains coherent without multiple reversals, fitting the length.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (rekindling light) is clear, and pressure tightens via the ritual’s phases, culminating in community uptake. However, opposition remains abstract—no counterforce or credible risk of failure on the page—so escalation skews gentle rather than testing. The “price” is future labor rather than a present trade‑off. Still, the cadence shift from silence to chorus satisfies the lens’s demand for a decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (evade the knowledge‑eating presence without breaking her purpose) is clear and tightens at the midnight chimes. The meaningful turn is her shift from physical hiding to ontological blending; options narrow credibly. The tension sustains, but the pass‑by of the guardian feels a touch easy, with minimal on‑page jeopardy or loss. Still, pressure remains coherent and resolves through her chosen stance.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are coherent—honoring the lost by making beauty—escalating from private grief to public, risky action to communal reception. The tightening arrives in the decision to plant at the bakery site in pre-dawn, a quiet but binding choice. Costs (illicit act, effort, exposure to frost) are present yet understated, which tempers pressure. The observed stranger’s response crystallizes the risk/payoff without a sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused: the archive’s health measured by emotional resonance versus its erosion by entropy. Pressure escalates via increasingly low readings until a decisive intensification with the rune‑etched slide pins the needle and forces a revaluation. The final choice—to seek vows rather than sample fading echoes—reads as an earned narrowing of options. The on‑page price is conceptual more than visceral, keeping intensity just below peak.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear early (get proof before sunrise) and tighten through failed attempts and the precise distraction gambit. The reversal is earned by Elara’s agency; the cost is relational rupture and heightened exposure. Pressure coheres under the causal lens without coincidence-driven rescue. If anything, the risk of immediate retaliation is lightly sketched, keeping the price largely emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres from observational curiosity to a singular trade‑off: remain and study or converge and depart. The tightening arrives with the emergent compass becoming visible and hungry for gathered energy, narrowing options. Her agency drives the resolution; the price is leaving the known world. Stakes are focused and escalate without gimmick or reset.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to risk dissolution by opening to the cave—tightens with the journal’s caution and lineage reveal. The reversal is internal: from suppression to full conduit, with the loss of the safer sealed option. The price is felt (accepting sorrow and potential overwhelm) and the resolution is chosen, not bestowed. Escalation is measured rather than harrowing, but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent: truth versus complicity in a city running on scarcity and silence. Pressure tightens via the machine’s rule—candor as currency—forcing a personal cost at the peak. Escalation is steady rather than sharp, but the demand for a truth narrows options credibly. A more explicit foreclosure (e.g., what she gives up by choosing candor) would heighten the price.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stake (revive wonder) is clear, and pressure tightens via a patient grind: long labor, fragile momentum, and the fragment’s finite melt. The decisive intensification is the first drop’s tone that reweights reality, with the price of the fragment’s loss. There’s no hard reversal or forced trade‑off beyond endurance, which keeps it from the highest band, but within the chosen lens the deepening is sufficient and earned. The coincidence does not do the solving; Elara’s sustained agency does.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—survival through escape—and tightens via the need to access and use the fear-box to power the burn. The mid-beat deepening (realizing the static is the childhood-fear box) narrows options and forces a trade: self-immolation of the dome for one launch. The cost is explicit and reverberates into the final stance. Escalation is protagonist-driven at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are coherent (recovering Isabella’s hidden claim to protect the place) and tighten once—choosing to wait/listen rather than pry. The communal storytelling raises pressure in a quiet register, culminating in the tactile act of pressing the locket. Opposition is weak; there’s little live resistance beyond time and restraint, so cost remains modest. Still, the deepening is earned and legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is established early (liberate knowledge without sealing the vault) and tightens through the character test. The decisive act (taking the die) triggers a visible, escalating price (compromised integrity, rising water) that forces immediate adaptation (sprint/escape). Agency drives each turn; pressure coheres to the end. The moral calculus is present without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—knowledge of where memories go—tightens through the journey into the high‑risk exhumation, which triggers a physical backlash and yields the ephemeral kiss. The price shifts from bodily peril to a lasting burden of knowledge and a harder return under heavier gravity. Agency is clear in the choice to exhume and to restore the book, and the resolution is an earned stance (lighting lamps despite darkness). Stakes skew conceptual but are made visceral at the crystal break.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—neutralize a world‑scale hum—tightens when the prophecy retaliates with inciting visions that nearly rupture his focus. The choice to refuse anger and recommit to mapped quiet forecloses the lure of cathartic noise. Cost is legible (exhaustion, release of the wing) and the cadence shift into the silent flash reads earned. Stakes remain internalized on the page but the pressure is coherent and escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—access to a dead language and a buried heritage—tightens when Elara violates the “agreed upon lies,” forcing a leap that cannot be taken back. The cost is legible: loss of the mentor and the lifelong burden of hearing. Escalation is quiet but clear: from study to initiation, from words to communion. A tad more friction before the breach of the rule could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing a quarantined consciousness without harm—is clear early and tightens via the trial‑and‑error sequence. Pressure escalates through failed notes brushing despair and the risk of shattering/release. The F‑sharp discovery is a meaningful narrowing that reconfigures the emotional field to acceptance. Costs skew internal and temporal rather than material, but they register.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is early: fulfill the father’s paradoxical request without payment and with moral risk. Escalation deepens via the reveal and the required destruction of the false deed, narrowing options. The price is choosing complicity with a “calibrated treason” for justice. Slight softness remains in on‑page resistance; no counterforce beyond craft difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (prevent soulsong theft; verify the warning) and tighten once at the amphitheater. The escalation is mostly guided rather than resisted; Lyra faces little risk or loss, and the scheme collapses swiftly once she sings. Still, the turn to use the shell as an instrument is a credible agency beat. The antagonist’s confession compresses pressure but remains functional.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—granting the ghost peace by completing a promise—is clear and escalates from identification to reframing his death to delivery. The tightening comes with the revelation that the anchor is love/promise, not shame, which reweights the goal and tactics. However, external resistance is low; the path from insight to resolution unfolds without a concrete obstacle testing commitment. The felt price sits in letting go and closing the window rather than in a contested action.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around the headman’s demand versus Hideo’s ritual; the meaningful tightening is Hideo’s refusal to whistle and the subsequent formation of the light‑net. Stakes are scaled to quiet social legitimacy and purpose, not grand, but clear. The resolution grows from Hideo’s agency with a credible, if gentle, cost. A slightly sharper consequence would heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake (truth vs. sustaining illusion) tightens through discovery to an actionable crisis. Escalation is coherent: reveal → warning → decision → dismantling. The cost is legible in the destruction of the orchard’s illusion, though danger to the protagonist never spikes, keeping tension tempered. Agency drives the climax without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the integrity of the message—tightens sharply when the Unified Dawn jams her signal. The escalation is coherent and forces a trade-off: she rejects power-for-power tactics, paying the price of dispersion and ambiguity. Internal/external conflicts mesh at the turn. The cost is felt rather than merely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear and singular: recover a lost voice/translate silence. Escalation under the accumulative lens occurs via layering raw dissonance toward a cohesive pattern, with the key tightening when the final jar softens and reconciles the mix. The poet’s agency drives every turn; coincidence (the wind delivering the box) sets the stage but does not resolve it. Price remains gentle (time, solitude, attention), keeping intensity modest but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates coherently—approach thrum to “crescendo,” apparatus shuddering, final infinitesimal adjustment. Agency is central and the tightening is clear, but the on‑page price for success is light, with no trade‑off beyond effort. Stakes stay focused and visceral through sound and structural vibration. The reversal is earned by her tuned counter‑wave rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (redefining the horizon through patience) tightens via the viaduct anomaly, forcing a reframe of obstacle into key. The decisive turn is the choice to alter the structure for future mappings, foreclosing immediate spectacle in favor of slow change. Costs are more philosophical than visceral but are tied to action. Pressure escalates coherently without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres and tightens as the memories intensify and lead to a specific site where the core tragedy is uncovered. The meaningful turn is Elara’s decision to proceed against protocol and then to convert the object into a grave marker. Stakes are personal and ethical rather than physical, which works but keeps the on-page price subtle. No antagonist is needed; the Department’s pressure and Cora’s echo suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to atone and whether grace should be contingent—tightens through the device’s performance and Anya’s challenge. The on‑page turn is the “Do they deserve it?” beat and its answer via light and purchase. Cost registers as a relinquishment of self‑protective guilt for a tool‑based ministry. Escalation is internal but coherent and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (will he activate/interpret the yearning) is clear, with one meaningful tightening when chaos forces Kiv to find a constant. His choice to use the arrow tip credibly deepens pressure and unlocks progress. The escalation is coherent under a causal lens. The price (embracing decisiveness/violence-coded symbol) is implied rather than dramatically paid.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are unified: expose truth vs protect career. Pressure tightens through concrete turns—digital ghosts to physical proof—culminating in a non-reversible action. The price is legible and thematically coherent (corporate reprisal, loss of career standing). While there’s no antagonist on the page, the institutional pressure is felt and escalates appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens via the mirror‑by‑mirror assembly culminating in the valve image. The decisive turn—choosing engineers over garrison—narrows options and risks censure. However, the external opposition is minimal; the engineers’ immediate compliance reduces friction at the peak. Tension accrues, but the price paid is more implied than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are internal but legible: will she keep seeking an external “note,” or accept an internal letting go. Pressure deepens through the old woman’s calm framing; the meaningful tightening is Elara’s decision to release the parasol tip. The price—foreclosing the hunt for an external diagnostic sound—is clear for this length. It’s quiet but not static.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (connection versus isolation) tightens from private discovery to interpersonal risk. The escalation is primarily emotional-textural; the key pressure point is Elara’s choice to reveal and to reframe Leo’s pain via the vine metaphor. Costs are felt but soft—no path is dramatically foreclosed beyond privacy. Effective, if deliberately quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (trap the echo before it fades) is established early, with a decisive deepening when the scout arrives—his honesty becomes both disturbance and tool. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens and culminates in the binding act. The visible cost is modest (fatigue, the parapet’s burden), which slightly softens the edge of the climax. Still, agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (complete the puzzle/transform pain) tightens once when the last piece resists and Elara must leave the studio. The choice to linger at the field creates the decisive insight; escalation is quiet but coherent, culminating in the decision to make the work communal. The price is modest but present (yielding ownership, recasting the “masterpiece”). Pressure is soft yet effective for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around whether Elara will remain silent or risk testifying, with a meaningful tightening when the crystal returns a non-self resonance. The decision to speak publicly narrows her options and reweights the social field; the external murmur beginning validates the shift. Stakes read as communal (language revival) but are mediated through personal risk, which could use one sharper on-page price. Still, escalation under the accumulative lens is clear and sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular: capture the sound of growing older despite forgetting; pressure coheres and deepens when the three markers converge and the vision hits. The decisive intensification is his frantic, time‑squeezed listening and the acceptance of a fragment as the price of the pursuit. The cost—endless recurrence and partiality—charges the final recommencement. No antagonist needed; the constraint itself applies pressure credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (orbital loss) is signaled early, and pressure coheres through tremors and the spinning hand. Escalation deepens via the internal method and culminates in a single decisive intervention. The price paid is largely inward—attention and reorientation—so felt risk outweighs visible loss. A touch more resistance or trade‑off would heighten the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake (a flawless goodbye, hours not days) is stated early and coherently escalates as the improvised music conjures memory and narrows options toward the final breath. Agency lies in Elara’s precise craft; the price is the irrevocable stillness it ushers. The intensification to “Eleanor” and the scent shift mark a decisive deepening. No antagonist needed; pressure remains focused and tight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates via a failed attempt and tactic reversal (“Relearn”). The meaningful tightening is the recognition that logic alone won’t open the machine; she must risk vulnerability and purpose. Price is conceptual rather than visceral, so pressure is refined rather than acute. Still, the deepening changes options and earns the end.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (recover the child), with a meaningful tightening when Elara chooses to set the Fae’s bone before claiming the boy. The ethical trade—returning the tooth—reweights the transaction and narrows the “take and flee” option. The cost is soft but present as empathy over retribution. Tension is steady rather than harrowing, appropriate to the quiet fable mode.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear early (how to share light without fire), and pressure tightens with the discovery of the fissure and the last rays of the setting sun. The decisive act—using the polished shard to refract the beam—earns the final stance. The internal trade‑off against solitude is present but not heavily tested, keeping the cost subtle. Escalation is single‑step but sufficient for the length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (can vulnerability be safely shared after public exposure?) clarifies early and tightens with Leo’s entrance. Escalation is a textural deepening: from solitude to a risky invitation to his acceptance signaled by pocketing the phone. The visible price is small but legible (renouncing the phone/world’s gaze, risking intimacy). The quiet design maintains pressure without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (whether to fixate on loss or enact Clara’s hopes) tightens as he enters the nexus, witnesses others’ hopes, and revisits the bedside charge. The meaningful turn is the physical renunciation—casting the shell—paired with the internal refusal to remain cynical. Pressure builds coherently under the accumulative lens. The cost is felt but quiet; one more explicit on‑page temptation to stall would raise tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear and singular: restore the Great Vine or lose sacred communion. Escalation includes a credible tightening (initial silence/failure before resonance; the live clock of the harvest moon). Resolution follows from Elara’s agency, but the path smooths quickly and lacks a felt price or trade‑off. The conflict stays coherent but avoids deeper complications.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: capture and preserve a living map before the aurora fades. Escalation occurs through a ritual tightening—wait, arrange, uncork, hum, seal—with the live window of light as pressure. The price is legible (surrender of gathered artifacts and essence, irreversible fusion). Because the conflict stays interior/ritual, it lacks a sharp reversal, but the cadence shift suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative lens, pressure tightens through patterned study → reassembly → rare convergence. The decisive intensification is the natural flute’s note aligning with her mapped angles. Stakes remain somewhat abstract (preserving wonder) and cost is modest, but agency guides the deepening cleanly. No coincidence resolves; the environment’s timing is earned by her preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear early (preservation vs. entombment), and pressure coheres as the weave collapses. The meaningful tightening occurs when the structure threatens to become a “single, heavy, useless mass,” forcing a risky shift in method. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (the stars) does not solve the problem without her choice. The price—letting go of self‑orientation and working blind—is felt, if not brutal.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—contain volatile grief within a form “while the kettle boils”—is signaled early and tightens as the kettle escalates. The whistle forces a trade‑off between suspended reflection and present action, creating a clean beat shift. The price is the acceptance of a new stasis (hollow as foundation) rather than an external loss. Stakes stay internal; one sharper on‑page compromise could raise tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: severing vs. partnering with the past self. The tightening turn is the ghost’s reframe that forecloses the “let me go” path and forces acceptance with cost. The final choice (to keep the blueprint and act) is earned and internal-external beats interweave via the token. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—repurposing the terminal—tightens once when the plan converts to activation and steam arrives. Escalation is largely procedural, with minimal pushback or reversal; success arrives without a significant obstacle besides toil. The cost is endurance and isolation, not a tough trade‑off under pressure. The final choice feels earned but light on consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reclaim or renounce her maker’s role) is signaled early and tightens when the bear—her own abandoned design—arrives with a visible demand. The meaningful turn is the chest‑panel reveal and the recognition that the hush is her responsibility to resolve. The price is emotional risk and surrender of protective stasis; while soft, it’s legible. Pressure coheres without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure builds quietly but decisively: instinctive draw to the wall, repeated hauls, the tactile click of the hidden compartment, and the content of the notes reweight the stakes. The escalation is a density increase rather than a fight, fitting the chosen lens. Cost is internal—a painful re-seeing—credible at this scale but not sharply contested on the page. One meaningful deepening lands with the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (unlock the method/knowledge) is clear and tightens when the knot resists, then unfurls into a charged pattern. Escalation comes through a deepening of pattern recognition rather than overt peril, consistent with an accumulative lens. The price is modest but legible: she spends trust, patience, and bodily comfort to achieve the shift. Resolution stems from her chosen tactic (gentle pressure) rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    The pressure coheres around whether presence can be made legible without the person; the tightening occurs when Isolde plucks the thread and Elara’s method turns physical. Stakes are intimate but real: the risk of falsity versus true communion and the redefinition of Elara’s practice. The escalation is a density shift rather than a fight, apt for the lens, though the felt price remains primarily conceptual. The final reweighting clearly arises from Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reviving life/beauty—tightens through the hour of nothing, the crack, the specter, and the city’s response. Escalation is driven by his build and activation choices; the cost is emotional rather than bodily but unmistakable. A single deepening turn (memory not life) reweights the goal. Slightly more explicit foreclosing of an option (e.g., an irreversible expenditure or breakage) would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are internal (atonement/repair), and pressure escalates via ritual focus: tending shoots → finding the tree → tying the coin → hearing the song. The meaningful tightening is the choice of the wounded sentinel and the commitment to mark it, but external resistance is minimal. Costs are primarily emotional and conceptual, not contested by counter‑forces in scene. The cadence shift at the light‑strike provides the needed deepening without a second reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around whether and how to open the sealed box; the seam appearing after tracing is the meaningful tightening. Agency drives the peak as she “pushes not with muscle, but with will.” The price is gently drawn—releasing what was repressed and her own skepticism—so escalation feels more luminous than perilous. A touch more risk or potential harm would intensify stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve vs. transform the fate of civilizations) is clear, and pressure deepens with the gear’s second reveal. The key tightening arrives when the “record” reconfigures into a “message,” prompting Elara’s new purpose. The felt price is patience and burden more than a foreclosed alternative, which keeps tension refined rather than acute. Effective escalation for the chosen mode, if not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is clear (find/form collective grief), and pressure deepens as attention intensifies, culminating in the family’s poem ritual. Escalation is primarily density and cadence rather than forced choice, with one meaningful intensification at the vision. The cost remains internal and conceptual; no option is visibly foreclosed on the page. A sharper trade‑off or loss would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—guarding community time versus personal absolution—tightens with the bob’s appearance and culminates in a costly renunciation. The physical struggle with the sea deepens pressure before the moral pivot. The resolution forecloses a path (keeper of the hour) with communal consequences. While tension is primarily internal, it remains coherent and escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (understand the old intention) is signaled early, and escalation tightens through the golden thread to the unlocking and revelation. The deepening is knowledge‑driven rather than adversarial, appropriate to the lens, and protagonist agency drives each turn. The on‑page price is subtle, skewing more toward future burden than present sacrifice, which slightly softens the pressure’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—averting starvation by committing to a risky plan—is signaled early and tightened by the blank page moment. Escalation is internal but credible: modeling → doubt → vow → writing. The choice forecloses safety in tradition and accepts reputational/heretical cost. Pressure grows coherently to a committed stance rather than resolving cheaply.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—smuggling narrative back into the world—tightens via the pirate’s cryptic method that shifts tactics from telling to listening. Escalation is mostly internal and procedural; the felt danger of the regime remains atmospheric rather than tested in scene. The hinge moment reweights options effectively. Cost is implied endurance and risk, not an acute on‑page hit.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: can she hold an ending long enough to witness it. Pressure coheres through the live clock (chair slowing), breath control, and the final particle settling; the sneeze is a clean, consequential turn consistent with the lens. Agency manifests as deliberate endurance and refusal to rescue, with a visible price (letting it dissolve). Escalation is elegant but quiet; the external trigger slightly dampens agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early: truth’s utility vs. social cohesion. Pressure coheres and tightens when the slate’s content collides with Elara’s moral parable, forcing a trade‑off. The resolution—teach navigation instead of reveal culpability—forecloses a path with a felt ethical cost. Escalation is measured rather than acute, with limited on‑page consequence beyond internal price.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure coheres around whether Leo will be expelled or undertake the harder path of unlearning. Anya’s demonstration deepens the conflict and narrows Leo’s options by reframing his stance. The decisive tightening is his relinquishing combat to ask “How?”—a small but consequential surrender. The cost is felt but understated, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate from hope to urgent intervention as the plant goes “wild, frantic,” making inaction untenable. The pruning choice narrows options and exacts a clear price in sensory overload while averting environmental damage. Pressure remains coherent to the end; the waning alignment adds a ticking clock. The resolution is earned by her active refocusing rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (food system collapse via hive failure) is clear and pressures the moment. Escalation tightens from failure to vulnerable reveal to technical reorientation, with the cost of relinquishing secrecy. Resolution follows protagonist agency (choosing to reveal), not luck. The large-scale stakes resolve quickly, but tension holds at scene scale.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—understanding a living house—tightens through the confluence, which deepens knowledge and narrows her stance from analysis to participation. Escalation is texture-driven, not adversarial, yet the decisive intensification is unmistakable when silence becomes absolute and then companionable. The price is quiet: relinquishing observer distance to become part of the house’s tapestry. Pressure remains coherent; no false resets.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around the Statue’s paradigm shift and the ampoule’s deployment, with a meaningful tightening when brute force is rejected for threading the fracture. Stakes are mostly conceptual—guardianship versus mourning—yet the single deepening suffices at this length. The price is giving up certainty; the escalation is subtle rather than visceral. No contrivance resolves the conflict; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single dominant stake (control vs. surrender to chance) tightens through the “most ambitious” proof toward a committed roll accepting the chipped die without correction. The rupture is a meaningful turn that narrows her old tactic set and imposes a new stance (“gardener” instead of solver). The price—abandoning her corrective bias—is readable, though the danger remains mostly conceptual. Tension scales steadily rather than via multiple reversals, apt for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused on awakening communal memory; escalation arrives through increasing density of visions and the timed full-moon unveiling. Agency is quiet but present: she chooses to persist, to translate, and to invite witnesses. The cost is largely borne off-page (sustained insomnia), and risk in the exhibition moment is emotional rather than perilous. The tightening is clear even if low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (cultural survival via revived practice) is clear, and the escalation tightens through the cliff climb and the adaptive pivot from bread to wax. The decisive deepening is the lens‑revealed alphabet that changes options. Prices (risk, scarcity of the last hive, acceptance of substitution) are present but lightly rendered. No antagonist is needed; pressure remains coherent and builds to the communal act.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (defying fate’s design) is clear; escalation arrives via the activation beat and the lens’s unexpected inward rotation. Pressure deepens once (nothing happening → groan → radiance), but the price of proceeding is not meaningfully foreclosed or traded off on the page. The conflict remains largely internalized aspiration rather than contested. The ending is earned yet lacks a sharp on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (resist a fear‑feeding entity) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as the entity swells, demanding “More!” The tactical turn—confessing through paradox and then weaponizing boredom—comes from her agency. Emotional price is present but could be more viscerally taxed or foreclose a clearer path. Still, escalation and payoff read clean under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (survive and transmute the storm) is legible, and escalation tightens once: silence → first gust → conducting full fury. Agency drives the outcome, but the sequence reads assured; obstacles convert smoothly without a visible, painful trade‑off. The storm’s “robbed” cacophony dissipates quickly, muting jeopardy at the peak. A single on‑page sacrifice or near‑loss would sharpen cost.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—breaking isolation to confront the watchers—tightens meaningfully when the gate splits. Escalation is protagonist‑driven and coherent under the causal lens, with one decisive intensification. Prices are implied more than dramatized; resistance from the Council and practical peril remain offstage. Still, the precise crack and ensuing encounter reweight options effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. destroy the letter as a route to truth—is clear and tightens through the debate. The chosen method (drawing parallels in the art) supplies a meaningful deepening that changes Elara’s options. Escalation remains largely intellectual; there’s little felt price or foreclosed path beyond her renunciation of destruction. The resolution is earned but restrained in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving/transforming loss) is clear and deepens when the locket reframes the task from public memorial to personal elegy. The cost is felt (cold, exhaustion, breakthrough sob, acceptance) and tactics adjust (what he writes, where he seals notes). Pressure coheres without an antagonist; escalation is modest but sufficient at this length. A minor external constraint beyond isolation could have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth versus civic myth—tightens decisively at the palimpsest reveal, forcing a trade‑off. Pressure coheres under the blackout’s cover and her role’s responsibility. The price is moral complicity and a chosen delay; the final stamp action forecloses a path. Slightly more external friction could have intensified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to live with grief—tightens from failed mementos to a monument and finally to costly release. The key turn is her decision to open the latch and let the last dream go, paying a clear price. Internal and external threads interweave without clutter; the ascent/descent motif deepens pressure. Tension is quiet but persistent, appropriate for the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (locate the pool during the brief power lull) is signaled early; the clock and required silence create coherent pressure. The escalation is a single, meaningful intensification (silence → cast → hit) appropriate to the accumulative lens. The felt price is muted but present in the bodily ache and the refusal of joy; the final line crystallizes a new, narrower path (“learn how to drink”). A more explicit trade‑off or risk on the page would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres: the directive vs. personal need tightens into a single high‑stakes choice when data remains “noise” without the physical key. The decisive escalation is Elara’s disobedient insertion, narrowing options. The “pull” exacts a conceptual price, though external consequences remain off‑page. Stakes stay intimate and legible rather than inflated.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around whether to overwrite a shameful truth with a comforting lie; the incursion of the real memory is a clear deepening. Stakes escalate from professional task to moral complicity, forcing a choice with cost. The resolution is an earned renunciation rather than a neat fix. A slight increase in on‑page consequence (e.g., client presence) could intensify the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (preventing bloodshed during the exchange) is legible from the first beat. Pressure coheres and tightens at the moon’s emergence and the spit/weapon draw, forcing Elara’s intervention strategy. The cost—renouncing immediate vengeance and accepting an uneasy, provisional peace—reads on the page. Escalation is efficient and centered on protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding a workable orientation—tightens via the psychic “backlash of regrets,” forcing a near‑retreat before the osprey beat clarifies stance. The pressure grows coherently and is resolved by his agency through renunciation/attention, not luck. Cost is felt but more conceptual than visceral, which slightly softens the edge. Still, the single meaningful deepening is undeniable and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—choosing connection over self‑protection—tightens as the journey narrows options from decoding to committing a gift. The meaningful turn is the discovery of the baseball and its future date, which reweights her quest and forces a trade‑off. Cost is choosing exposure and forfeiting value; escalation is internal but coherent. Pressure could sharpen further with a concrete external risk in the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reforge the bond) stays tight; escalation occurs through a concrete setback (shade/echo) and a higher‑cost pivot (merging rather than summoning). The turn forecloses the path to a tactile reunion, clarifying price and deepening commitment. Pressure is coherent and rises under the hybrid lens; no coincidence resolves the core problem. A slightly sharper on‑page test of risk in the merger could have further tightened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early: reclaim time versus accept loss. Pressure coheres through the Keeper’s warning and the vision’s painful ledger, culminating in a choice that forecloses the retrieval path. The escalation is a decisive deepening rather than multiple turns, appropriate to length. Cost is visible in the scenes of missed intimacy and the relinquishment of the initial goal.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the “dimension” by resolving stored grief—intensifies from oppressive gravity to alchemical repair to the catalytic placement of Kwan Yin’s tear. Escalation is coherent and protagonist-driven, with a clear tightening pivot when she realizes happiness lightens gravity. The price is borne in her choice to absorb and transmute collective pain rather than avoid it. Stakes remain internal but map to concrete ship responses, keeping pressure legible.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (to understand transformation) tightens as she moves from clutching to releasing the jar and watching the fireflies ascend. The price—giving up the last valuable object and the self‑image it anchored—reweights the ending. Pressure is gentle and accumulative rather than adversarial but coheres under the chosen lens. Slight softness remains because coincidence does some lifting where further internal resistance could have intensified cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—rerouting power to ignite the presses—tightens plausibly through the blackout and dead lock mechanism. Escalation is driven by Kael’s agency, yet obstacles yield readily, with little visible cost or sacrificed option. The engineers’ reboot adds pressure but arrives after success, softening the peak test. A stronger on‑page price or near‑failure would heighten urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through a single purposeful tightening: the ritual fails/holds, then the eels’ answer catalyzes the mote. Agency drives the turn when he chooses alignment, not seizure. Cost is felt as surrender of control and acceptance of partial, fragile change, though no hard sacrifice is staged on the page. Tension is steady rather than jagged, fitting the piece’s cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—hide or weaponize truth—is signaled early and tightens when she reframes preservation as complicity. The meaningful turn is the choice to read aloud and then write and release the new poem, foreclosing the safer path. The cost is internal and situational rather than confrontational, but it clearly narrows future options. One added on‑page consequence would heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (duel vs alliance) is clear and escalates through the cipher reveal. The meaningful tightening is the reinterpretation of “overture,” narrowing options toward collaboration. Pressure remains cerebral; visible price or risk is modest, so the turn lands more as a reframing than a fraught trade‑off. Resolution stems from Elara’s choice rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation is coherent: discovery of the key, the decision to breach the sealed room, and the ethical deepening to compile and read aloud. The dominant stake—safety and concealment versus liberating silenced voices—intensifies, but the price is largely implied; no guard interruption or tangible repercussion tests the choice. The read‑aloud scene provides an emotional crest rather than a threat crest. Strong, if low‑temperature, tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres under the time limit and the sanctuary’s conditions; the boarding call and nightfall create a single tightening. Agency drives each step (key theft, decoding film, syncing mechanism), but resistance is minimal—no true reversal or trade‑off beyond the concept of echo vs. reversal. Cost reads as emotional acceptance rather than a concrete loss. Effective, but a tested obstacle would have sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is unambiguous and escalates through the impending monsoon and the discovery of an inert seed. The key tightening is the first drop of rain forcing the leap to an emotionally risky method. Resolution comes from her agency (choosing feeling as the operative medium) rather than coincidence. The cost signal is present but could cut deeper (e.g., a credible loss or trade-off paid in the moment).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal but legible early and deepen with one meaningful tightening when the compass points to the workshop, then to her heart. Pressure is quiet yet coherent under the accumulative lens; the act of tactile listening forces a stance rather than offering escape. The price—keeping the pain while letting it be transformed—registers. Slight softness remains in external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes a clear philosophical stake—can rational patterns contain irrational trauma?—and tests it relentlessly.

The conflict is entirely coherent and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.3)

The cost is the new weight of humility she must carry forward in her guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake signaled with first sentence: “translate silence into music.” Single pressure arc: Bloom fading = silenced “song.” One meaningful tightening—the fracture—narrowing rescue to one vibrating fork. Cost is physical endurance and irreversible time/labor; no off-page rescue.

    Dominant stake—survival via intergenerational support—is signaled early and tightened when anonymous gifts replace Elara’s failed run.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—remain anonymous scribe or become visible conductor—tightens when the cookie returns as summons. One meaningful escalation: the ajar door forces an unplanned encounter that forecloses retreat. Cost is legible: he abandons the diner, the only life we see.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth versus safety—tightens when data prove the quarantine is a lie. Escalation is causal: each dataset raises the cost of silence. The final choice to send the pigeon narrows her options to solitary resistance. Cost is felt in the curfew siren’s wail.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    A single dominant stake—the unlocking of involuntary memory—is intensified through escalating olfactory and emotional pressure. The tightening of options occurs when the Lunaria’s scent forces Elara from observer to grieving participant, the price exacted in the broken seal.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—feel time vs. save a lineage—tightens once via the vision. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (dust, clay, rope, light) increases pressure until the final refusal. Cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—public identity—tightens with every shared clue; discovering the artist’s hideout forces Elara to decide secrecy vs. welcome. Cost: she exposes only her own offer first, tangible Reed-fiber cost glowing on arbor.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the moth-image before the giant wakes—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the breathing shallows. The interrupted cadence fracture supplies a single decisive intensification that forecloses the option to wait; borrowing time from the giant’s nap exacts an on-page price (colder pendant, shallower breath).

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)

    Dominant stake—replicating intangible kindness—tightens once via the tape-triggered memory, a pivot that rechannels all risk into perpetual invisibility.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she learn what follows goodbye?—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the vortex offers the single path. Agency: she chooses to step in, renouncing safety.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether a conman’s last lie can be transmuted into an uncompensated good—signaled in ink drop one. Stakes tighten when forgery is revealed as rescue. Final cost: Elara embraces an unbalanced moral equation she must perpetuate.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the dawn’s unique resonance—tightens as the hum intensifies and histories flood in. The pressure is atmospheric rather than adversarial, yet the final image shows an irreversible absorption of stories, a felt forfeiture of ordinary perception.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness before obliteration—tightens as the countdown slows and cold bites. One meaningful deepening: recognizing the spiral as star-map turns passive waiting into active alignment. Cost is visible exhaustion and the irreversible vanishing of the grain.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the drone or the airship is lost—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by the three-hour horn. Escalation is causal: each diagnostic step narrows options until the bypass is the only path left. Cost is visible: Elara trades her calm isolation for the risk of public failure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten through silence and unnatural ice without a new external threat; convergence reweights options but lacks an immediate higher-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring the town’s lost “heartbeat”—is signaled early and escalates through daily, accumulative pressure. The final tightening is Elara’s percussive declaration; cost is the transience of the restoration. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and spiritual. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake—“harness the ephemeral…quiet the screaming static” vs sender’s fading pulse—escalates through tightening countdown. Oxygen and life-sign flatline are live prices; the final choice costs the sender’s actual death, legible and on-page.

    Dominant stake—replace inherited lies with personal truth—tightens when the storm breaks routine and the echo appears.

One meaningful deepening: ghosts’ overlapping paths converge, adding ancestral pressure without external antagonist. Cost is legible—her blistered palms, the trance-risk, the irreversible dawn—but the beat-to-beat escalation is more accretive than sharply reversed. Sufficient for 600-word scope, yet a second micro-turn could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring faith in lineage—is signaled early and tightened once: the broken sundial must be rebuilt to reach the tomb. Agency is clear; coincidence never resolves. The price (exhaustion, risk of desecration) is legible but understated, holding it under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—deliver the hidden rendezvous intact—tightens once when Kael realizes the chalk is the key and must act before the postal collection. The cost is the inevitable loss of the chalk code to rain or footfall, a visible price that reweights the final moment. Escalation is single but sufficient under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent false-flag catastrophe—signaled early. Pressure tightens via embroidered revelation; each stitch narrows options until only Western Gate path remains. Agency: Elara’s decision to wear tapestry as disguise forces confrontation with guards. Cost is social humiliation and potential torching of her life’s work. Coincidence (young guard’s insight) complicates but does not resolve; the map’s clarity earns the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: break the boy’s silence. Escalation tightens once: Elara’s decryption narrows options from chaos to named fear, forcing speech. Cost is the emotional toll on both. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover lost joy”—is signaled early and tightened when the fragment triggers memory. Escalation is accretive: each strip of film narrows possibility until the phantom tree stands. Cost is the inevitable fade of light; the installation cannot last. Agency is hers alone; coincidence (finding the fragment) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—revive or silence—tightens when Elara learns the garden was silenced by force. Agency crystallizes in the tap that completes the creator’s sabotage; the cost is perpetual responsibility, not mere repair.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—protect the unregistered mind—escalates as Auditors close in. One decisive tightening: Lysander chooses to warp the pattern, sacrificing the code and his freedom. Cost is visible—hands in dirt, arrest, ruined lexicon. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—turn sleepless anguish into one night’s peace—is signaled early. Escalation is the tightening of wind-songs until they demand transcription; the cost is the “exquisite wrenching” of spirit. Agency is renunciation/creation; no external reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve any sound before the chime dies”—gains one precise tightening when the bamboo’s definitive fade forces launch of nightly cataloging; that clock is palpable. Agency: Elara replaces mechanical resonance with her own throat, a cost in voice and surrender of legacy tool.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore trust via deciphering—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each vow spoken narrows the path until the final glyph flares and the option of continued silence is foreclosed. Cost is the ink’s exhaustion and the irreversible shift from isolation to return. No external antagonist needed; the text itself applies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—city survival vs. mountain integrity—tightens when the console lies and Kael’s sabotage forces a triangulated third path. Escalation is causal: tremble → polymer clue → reroute. Cost is legible in the groaning stone and Elara’s post-decision weight.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to re-engage trust—tightens once: from refusal to act to walking to the post office. The cost is visible in the tremor of purpose replacing fear. No escalation loops; one decisive turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—find Leo—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation occurs when the terrace reveals the maze’s emotional weather codes, forcing Elara to translate fear into safe passage. Cost is visible: the world outside remains broken, their sanctuary finite. No coincidence resolves the crisis; Leo’s faith and Elara’s decoding jointly earn the reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake: belonging vs. exile. Tightening occurs when the fireflies replace the feather as focal point, narrowing options from flight to acceptance. Agency is attention, not action; cost is the quiet surrender of the surface world. Pressure is coherent but low-grade, fitting the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“why paths disappear”—is signaled early and tightened once when the glyphs reveal the captain’s deliberate embrace of the maelstrom.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is declared early: “prove even randomness could sing.” Pressure tightens once when the woman’s randomness creates unintended harmony; further deepens when Eli deliberately sacrifices control. Final option refusal (forgoing win for harmonic consonance) crystallizes the cost of abandoning proof for connection. One visible price: the abandoned bishop as emblem of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve forbidden memory—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is the progressive filling of skin-canvas; each star narrows future options. Cost is the irreversible use of last pigment and the literal pain. Agency is hers alone; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming mundane glass into life-saving light—is signaled early and deepened through the lens commission. However, pressure escalates only interpretively; no concrete obstacle or trade-off narrows Elian’s options, so the “tightening” is more lyrical than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate private guilt into bearable memory—is signaled early and tightened by the act of scattering. Agency is renunciation, not rescue; the tightening narrows her options from saving to witnessing. Cost is the irreversible dispersal of the last relic. Pressure remains coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—hoping the world survives—intensifies as successive balloons crash; final rise delivers felt pressure. Middle lacks a tangible trade-off; risk is conceptual rather than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Central stake: map fading acoustics vs. rescue Argossy memory; tension deepens when Lysander’s diaries force her to redirect from acoustics to artifact recovery. The beat “silent eye … sighing corner” escalates via acoustic cue narrowing options, paying cost by shifting her career goal, but no additional external opposition or visible physical price appears, keeping escalation credible but moderate-length appropriate.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—coaxing mirrors into possibility—is signaled early and tightened once: from asking to commanding light. The bell’s first note crystallizes the cost, foreclosing further attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—ratify the accord before the celestial window closes—is signaled early and escalates through the muster ritual. The tightening is single but decisive: the projected schematic solidifies into a seal, foreclosing all future battle plans. Cost is visible in Kaelen’s shuddering breath and Elara’s emptied clipboard.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to consummate the echo or relinquish it—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. The crack-map and approaching thunder create coherent pressure; the final refusal narrows options with visible cost. No reversals beyond the single decisive renunciation, sufficient for this length. Cost is legible in the rain erasing his design.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defy conformity via awakening—is signaled early and escalates through the harvest ritual. The tightening is conceptual: once she sees the tapestry of threads, compliance is impossible. Cost is felt as irrevocable awareness rather than tangible loss, satisfying the lens but staying cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling vs. commercial sensationalism—tightens when stick-flip forces her to foreclose the “fortress of fact” path. Pressure grows via accumulative density: each carved symbol adds weight until silence becomes unbearable argument for invitation, not defense. Cost legible in forfeiture of publisher contract and embrace of uncertain audience interpretation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The escalating quiet broken by the sudden rock crack tightens pressure, forces Elara into immediate rescue, and exposes the cost: her transient stay ends, leaving only fragile trace. One tightening—witness threatened—forces decision and narrows every later option to single-hand knot rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened when the rope’s new weave becomes the only path.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—solve the metaphor of chosen paths—tightens as dreams progress from distant prophecy to immediate command. Storm countdown serves as live clock pressuring irrevocable choice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—seal the covenant—tightens when the priestess’s chant threatens loss of his life’s work. Escalation is causal: each calculation narrows options until the only path is guardianship. Cost is felt in the smoldering charts and the tile’s new heaviness.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: can resentment be released? Pressure tightens when the broken melody collapses, forcing Kael to accept imperfection. Agency is Elara’s, but the decisive turn is Kael’s micro-choice to exhale. The cost—his relinquished anger—is visible, though the escalation is more cadence than causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture dream without destroying it—tightens when the mirror threatens to shatter. One decisive deepening: she pivots from force to invitation, paying with the ruined sextant. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no off-stage resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—Guild betrayal severs Elara’s path; the pendulum lens reweights options without offering a clean victory. Escalation pivots on her hands-on re-composition of light rather than revenge or appeal. One credible on-page loss: professional identity, now “heretical.” Pressure is coherent, no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—accept or refuse the inheritance—is signaled early and tightens once: the journal’s blank pages begin scripting her in real time. Escalation is causal: blank cameo → unobserved gazebo → final choice with irreversible cost. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the traveler by finding the library—is signaled early and tightened when the diary warns of paradox. Escalation is one deepening: quest reframed from hunt to surrender. Agency remains with Elara; coincidence does not resolve. Cost is the irreversible sealing of the path and the internal unlearning.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—wholeness via recovered twin—is signaled early and tightened once: the “passenger of two minds” logbook entry reframes the quest from search to self-repair. Agency is Elara’s interpretive labor; cost is the dissolution of the fantasy brother. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover erased truth—signaled early. Escalation: blank pages → impossible door → vision of erasure. Agency in re-knotting narrows options and exacts cost (custodianship of dangerous knowledge). One tightening is sufficient; coincidence complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“restore the caves’ song”—is signaled early and tightened through each beat. Escalation is accumulative/textural: the hum grows heavier, the stone darker, until the single crystalline note slices it away. Agency is continuous; her whispered tone is the active lever. The visible price is the irreversible shift from mapkeeper to keeper of equilibrium, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“prove coincidences have meaning”—tightens through nightly charting to the triple-star convergence. One decisive intensification: the prism fails as intended tool yet succeeds as accidental lens, foreclosing restoration and charging the new beacon with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—identity versus archival duty—tightens once when the whispered “I wish I had gone with you” pierces Elara’s rational detour; climax’s micro turn reprises her own past pledge, forcing stance crystallization. The cost is emotional permanence: she must sit alone with the archive forever—felt, clear, on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“one brief light against enduring night”—is signaled early and escalates with rising silence and visible cost of every flare. One tightening beat where doubt collides with the mosaic’s “Remember” crystallizes resolve, narrowing choice to ignite. Escalation is situational pressure against ambience rather than external antagonist, but feels sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether the partnership survives—is signaled early and tightened when the vision forces a mutual re-evaluation. The tightening beat (shared glimpse of three futures) narrows options and carries felt cost. Agency is shared, but Elara’s initial deflection into the grotto still drives the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—collecting silences vs. fear of containment—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation occurs via the inversion: gravity flip forces Elara to test her method (limiting exposure) and confront the new silence. Cost is tangible: the doll’s irreversible sprout marks the loss of her bunker-identity. Pressure tightens once, cleanly under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can Elara transmute noise-absence into healing quiet?

Agency is hers; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“find the stairway before sunrise”—is signaled early and tightened by the mural excavation and ruby extraction. Each beat raises cost: peeling history, prying the flake, stepping into void. Sunrise deadline forces the final cadence shift; cost is visible in the dissolving ruby and the forever-empty throne.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Kael’s need to breathe without ghosts—is signaled early and tightened by the ash-pressure test. Escalation is one deepening beat, not multiple reversals, but the cost (near-asphyxiation) is visceral and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quantum promise drives escalating metaphysical pressure—each glitch raises stakes until it pins her in the crumpled cockpit; the tightening is one coherent intensification culminating in non-salvational crystallization. The refusal to sell the diamond forecloses the greed path at felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—“uncover the hidden truth”—is introduced early and tightened when the wire’s vibration reveals the handle. Pressure intensifies steadily under the Accumulative lens, yet the final shift trades discovery of fortune for discovery of freedom; the cost (Elara’s family myth dissolving) is evident but understated rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Silas redeem his own loss by restoring Elijah’s story? Pressure tightens as each archival clue narrows possibility until the photograph delivers a felt cost—his own grief is repurposed. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-reversal, and suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—memory vs. indifference—is signaled early and tightened when the dead-drop vanishes. Escalation is causal: each discovery (puddle map, booth, patrol) raises cost. Final choice to run toward light crystallizes stance with visible risk. One minor slack: patrol coincidence complicates rather than resolves, but feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing ruin via sonic negation—tightens once: the spectrum threatens to explode, Elara’s rests swallow it. Cost is visible in her slumped shoulders and the dew-tears that applaud her. Agency is hers alone; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: find a future where life can sprout. Escalation arrives via accumulating compass-signals narrowing to one option; no external antagonist needed. Each beat tests wanting certainty vs. accepting uncertainty—felt cost is abandoning every rebuilt clock. Single deepening, cleanly tied to theme and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“to understand the weight of names”—is signaled early and tightened when the vision forces Elara to rename Kael and herself. One meaningful deepening: grief reframed as luminous understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: free the regret-bound spirit with joy. Escalation is one tightening: each micro-adjustment of the tooth increases the distortion until the laugh breaks loose.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can mercy be calculated?—tightens as each sensory datum becomes a variable. One clear deepening: from endurance to self-forgiveness. Cost is felt in the strap’s fall, though pressure plateaus rather than spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: give the ghost rest. Security-door risk, hidden ceiling compartment, and ticking engine ratchet pressure to a single crystallized turn—insert the barrel, accept silence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—capture a lived second inside eternity—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single intensification: the whisper’s release tightens the conceptual field until all moments collapse into one. Cost is conceptual (loss of catalogued certainty) and legible on the page. Agency is mostly Elara’s, though the whisper’s autonomous action slightly dilutes pure protagonist pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redeem a civilization’s memory—tightens once when the shard’s glyphs force a choice between vengeance and empathy. Pressure grows via storm and mirror ritual; cost is the relinquishing of her old revolutionary identity, felt on page. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming stolen light—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: discovery of shadow → physical cost → tethering → cleansing.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—find the place where explanations fail—tightens when compass needle spins and points down, foreclosing the option to capture the scent. Escalation is one deepening beat: from seeking to accepting. Cost is the uncollectible scent, felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve and transmit the archway’s layered truth—tightens after GPS death; stakes rise when slide reveals the price of shared memory, and final sculpture enacts the only viable route, cost visible in the hiker’s “found” tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why night flowers bloom—tightens when the journal reframes it as faith in unseen pollinators. One clear escalation: spectral violet spotlights the stone. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of wall for ceiling) but lightly felt on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover truth versus risk of psychic dissolution—is signaled early. Micro-turn at the beach: parley with sentinel narrows choice from passive retrieval to active reparative dialogue; stakes tighten when spectral sentinel escalates from guard to witness to consenter. No coincidence resolves. Final cost: accepting custodianship of her silenced truth, foreclosing Elias’s prior neutrality. Visible price. Lens-supported escalation sufficient at 680 words.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—how to answer the old wishes permanently—tightens once when Elara decides to resurrect echoes rather than repopulate. The cost is visible in her fevered labor and the irrevocable solitude that follows; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs annihilate—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation tightens once: the harmonic reveals the recording is a trigger, not a record. Cost is the scribe’s betrayal of her life’s oath. Agency is hers alone; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—the survival of the vortex—is signaled early and escalates through each tightening swirl of light. The protagonist’s agency (gathering entropy) forces a trade-off: borrowed time is finite and granular. Cost is legible in the creeping return of frost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—sound alarm vs. preserve fragile peace—tightens once when the valley hymn reframes the cost of noise. Agency drives escalation: her refusal narrows options and accepts personal risk. Cost is legible in the towns’ self-reliant response.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—transforming passive stewardship into active witness—intensifies when the meteor shower drags Aris from cataloguing death to feeling it. The single tightening occurs in the empathic bolt: he cannot unfeel the star’s burn; options narrow to either mute denial or continued sacrificial ingestion. The visible cost is the physical memory of fire etched in his nerves.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve unspoken weight—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accretive: ghost-bees’ agitation → woman’s gaze → box’s glow, each beat tightening the pressure to act. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than combat; the cost is the absorption of the ghosts and the silence that follows. No external reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to spend finite breath—tightens when the phantom-year revelation forecloses denial. Escalation is textural: each artifact adds density until the cost of knowing outweighs the cost of dying. Agency remains Elara’s; the attic arrival complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—beauty in the incomplete—escalates through the drake crisis and narrows to the single feather. Cost is felt in the hush after trust is risked. One meaningful tightening suffices; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—interspecies respect—tightens from abstract desire to embodied communion. One meaningful escalation: the first clear note of oak consciousness, then the flood of shared memory.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming poisoned ground—tightens when the starving bird hijacks the ritual, forcing Elias to trade battlefield for bedside. Escalation is textural: each seed moved from sack to stone narrows the original goal into a co-dependent micro-garden. The cost is the lost grandeur of the planned memorial; the gain is fragile, embodied life. Coincidence (finding the bird) complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure tightens via leaf-star reveal that forecloses tracking and opens cosmic closeness; cost is tangible—leaf-sacrifice and memory-debt paid in the final beam.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding orientation after cosmic disorientation—is signaled early and escalates through pattern intensification: streaked stars → fleeting true star → new map.

Slight slack in mid-scene keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder vs sell it—clarifies early and tightens when apprentice recasts the job’s morality.

Pressure remains coherent; no extraneous reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving erased truths—faces immediate threat: “they want to unbind you.” Escalation is one clean tightening: the pawns’ return converts threat into renewed agency. Cost is legible in Kael’s risk and Elara’s exposed continuation. No extraneous reversals; pressure coheres under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she face the pain of memory to recover home?—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: the stone’s glyphs force a trade-off between painless ignorance and purposeful pain. Agency drives every turn; coincidence (feather drifting) complicates rather than resolves. Cost is the acceptance of lifelong ache in exchange for vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when Elias decodes the tapestry and sees the parallel to his own refusal to cut the flawed gambit. One meaningful deepening: realizing the error was pride, not the bad move itself. Cost is the felt surrender encoded in the click. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded thread increases pressure until renunciation is the only path.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether the clan will keep a single truth or allow multiplicity—escalates via Kaelen's agency: each stanza raises the cost until the Elders foreclose the option. The tightening is visible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove broken things hold worth—is signaled early and tightened by each pockmark matched; the final blaze forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers can guide—signaled early. Pressure tightens when the lens stalls, forcing Elara’s silent gesture to carry real navigational weight.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—map the geography of loss—faces a concrete test when hydraulics fail. Escalation is one meaningful tightening: from “I can still realign mechanically” to “I must invent a lunar guidance system.” The price is the irreversible loss of mobility and the perpetual ache of moon-acute perception. Agency is hers; coincidence (radio timing) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will Elara find a way to silence the Virus—tightens when the schematic reveals a weapon instead of a cure, forcing a choice between personal safety and collective survival.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the gesture—tightens through each gap observed. One meaningful deepening: realization the man was arriving, not lost, which reframes all prior evidence. Cost is felt when Elias relinquishes the flower, accepting permanent outsider status.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keep the promise, find the doorway—is signaled early and tightened by the rising creek. One meaningful turn: slotting the chip forecloses retreat to the surface.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mystery of bleeding starlight—tightens once when queen learns hereditary failure. Agency drives escalation: she climbs, accepts ritual, performs repair. Cost is visible (eternal vigil), though external pressure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the star’s presence—tightens when containment fails; Kael’s whisper reframes the conflict from force to understanding. One decisive deepening: revaluing purpose forecloses the path of containment. Cost is visible in the star’s irreversible transformation. Escalation is coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the heart can be mapped—narrows to a single choice: will she absorb or impose? Each sound note forces a decision (left/right).

No coincidence, all escalation stems from her agency under the inferred lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—redeeming the Kepler failure—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the anomaly’s message reframes the lichen from catastrophe to catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)

One decisive reversal: from arsonist-hoarder to public benefactor, paid for by personal risk. Pressure escalates because each fire narrows her safety margin. Cost is visible in the final tableau: her exile continues while the crowd deciphers her gift.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)

No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)

No extraneous reversals; pressure stays accumulative/textural under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elian’s quest for beauty in imperfection—tightens when he must risk his only reliable sense to awaken the rose.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—how to restore human connection after silence—tightens once when Elara pivots from playback to listening. The cost is the abandonment of her former identity, visible in the dismantled device. No external antagonist is needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—justify continued tending after irreparable loss—tightens when the jet triggers freeze; the micro-choice to stay with the bark forecloses flight and confirms endurance. Cost is the perpetual, unglamorous labor of planting in darkness.

    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—escalates from shield to cage to launch.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—escalates from passive listening to active invention once the buckle fails.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rupture a looping destiny—tightens via each failed trial; the fifth approximation forces the trade-off of total destruction for uncertain creation.

    Dominant stake—retrieve Codex and survive—is signaled in paragraph one. Pressure tightens once: tidal change collapses the exit, forcing the phase gamble. Cost is visible—she leaves the dead behind—and the choice is hers. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)

    Dominant stake—revive or abandon the dream—is signaled early. Escalation is the tightening silence that forces a single decisive act; cost is the emotional risk of restarting creation. No external reversals, but the silence itself is coherent pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the architecture of lies—is signaled early and tightened once when the notes reveal the lover’s death. Agency is Elara’s deliberate salvage and reading; the cost is the emotional weight of the truth. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving ancient methods—tightens when the knot rewrites itself, foreclosing the option of mere collection. Escalation is one meaningful deepening under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the cost is the shift from observer to participant. No reversals needed; the single intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake – understanding healing as integration – emerges mid-scene. The crimson thread tightens it by turning memory into tactile presence, foreclosing a purely external escape. Cost is internal, not enacted on page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the egg cracks into a specter, foreclosing literal rebirth. Escalation is causal: each assembly step narrows possibility toward the irreversible ghost-song. Cost is visible in Kaelen’s collapse and the bird’s departure. No extraneous reversals; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove scars can sing—is signaled early and tightened through the grafting ritual. Escalation is accretive: each handful of sand and final coin tie narrows options until the tree’s resonance answers the stake. Cost is visible in the reverent hush and the coin’s permanent placement. No external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the lid’s seam appears: one chance to unstick before the geese resume. Escalation is accumulative: each breadcrumb adds pressure until the final push with palms reweights the stake. Cost is visible—Elara loses her luminous detachment and becomes “one thread” in the tapestry. No reversals, but one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to merely preserve or to attempt breaking the cycle—is signaled early and tightened when the gear’s predictive model is revealed. One meaningful deepening: the gear is not just memory but a question. Cost is the acceptance of endless labor; escalation is conceptual rather than event-based, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to give form to collective grief—tightens once: the ghost-family’s poem-trade redefines the ribbon from ornament to stanza. Cost is conceptual (she must now carve silence), but a more visceral forfeiture would have lifted the score.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance—tightens when the bob appears; escalation is a single, intensifying beat that forces renunciation. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The price is the silence that follows her choice. Meets 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the world’s intention—tightens once when the golden thread reveals the sovereign case, then deepens again when the knot redefines the cemetery’s purpose. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the cost is conceptual but unmistakable. No external antagonist is needed.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break stagnation or starve—is signaled early; pressure tightens when doubt threatens to freeze her hand; the decisive act forecloses the safety of old ways with visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—ending the story famine—tightens through one decisive escalation: the broadcaster’s sign-off redefines Elara’s task from teaching to listening. Agency is hers; the cost is the lifelong labor of transcription. No reversals needed; one deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—capture a fleeting emotion—tightens once: the child’s sneeze dissolves the image, forcing Elara to accept impermanence. The cost is the literal loss of the portrait; pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve knowledge without destroying fragile peace—is signaled early and tightened when the slate’s truth threatens it. Escalation is one meaningful turn: from hoarding to strategic sharing. The price is the partial betrayal of his own creed, visible in the final beat. Agency drives the resolution; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can hatred be unlearned before the department dies—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is a single tightening: from Leo’s defensive anger to his whispered “How?”; the cost is the irreversible closure of the program and the long unlearning still ahead. Agency remains with Leo’s choice to listen; coincidence plays no role. One meaningful turn meets scope.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—transform decay into living hope—tightens when each pruning cut forces live loss of raw memory, yet the escalation is mostly lyrical rather than external. Cost is legible but scaled to poetic resonance, not visceral danger to Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—city starvation via hive failure—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: blackout → misaligned array discovered → realignment. Agency is Elara’s reveal of the riddle, which forces the technician’s tactical shift; cost is the tower’s newly scarred crown and the irreversible exposure of her secret. Coincidence is limited to the riddle’s perfect fit, but it complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake: will the house consume or partner? Escalates through accumulation of charged keepsakes rather than conventional stakes reversal. Pressure tightens when Elara’s own stone joins the array—irrevocably lodging her within the house’s memory. Could be sharper if she risks more tangible loss; cost is mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Statue’s purpose—signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each revelation until the final tone-shift. Agency is exercised in the pointing gesture and the acceptance of new knowledge; cost is the shattering of certainty. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Pressure escalates cleanly under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of regret—escalates through each proof until the rupture forces a trade-off: abandon the past or embrace the sprout; the cost is the irrevocable loss of the missed-opportunity quest itself.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving kindness is remembered—tightens when Elara shifts from proof to revelation; cost is her sleepless vigil and the blank canvas that must be filled. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens: accumulation of memories narrows her goal to curation rather than persuasion. No external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake (“cultural starvation”) tightens each beat: no grain forces reliance on wax, the theft of letters exacts a communal cost, and the climax reconfigures survival from feeding bodies to feeding memory.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled early and tightened once when the lens reverses. Agency drives escalation; cost is conceptual but legible. One clear tightening suffices for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—trick fear into exposing weakness—is signaled early and escalates through each paradoxical confession, tightening until the final reversal. Agency is high: every beat is Elara’s choice to speak the next riddle. Cost is felt in the clasp’s burn and the irreversible glow that now brands her. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the entity’s boredom is a direct consequence of her tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—survival of the orchard—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is causal: each harmonic conversion narrows the storm’s options until it dissolves. Cost is the spent energy that leaves Kai “thrumming,” a felt depletion on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—escape from isolation—tightens once when Kaelen’s pattern-song fractures the gate, foreclosing the option of remaining inside. Pressure escalates under causal agency: each study session and micro-choice narrows toward the decisive act. The cost is visible in the awe and fear of the people he must now lead. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the watchers merely confirm the path already opened.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—rescuing truth without destroying evidence—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation tightens once: Elara’s threat of public destruction forces Aris to invent the parallel-argument tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—salvage his mother’s drowned dream—is signaled early and tightened by each repair. The locket discovery deepens the cost from abstract elegy to personal wound. Escalation is accumulative: each note raises emotional ante until the final sealing of her specific memory. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; coincidence complicates (finding locket) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. civic stability—escalates as blackout removes surveillance, letting palimpsest surface. Single decisive tightening: stamp reveals surrender terms, forcing Elara’s covert preservation. Cost is moral complicity, legible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform grief or be consumed by it—signaled early. Pressure tightens through failed cranes, then crystallizes in the lantern’s completion; releasing the dream forecloses retreat. Cost is the irreversible loss of the last recording, made visceral as the light folds into crane form. Agency drives every escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—locate the pooled potential—tightens when the resonance from K-7B forecloses the option of believing the universe is only entropy. Agency is Elara’s psychic pulse and listening; cost is the ache in her ruined eye and the cold ash of lost joy. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode belonging—is signaled early and tightened when conventional methods fail. One meaningful deepening: realization that “missing pieces” are contextual, not data, forces the physical pull to the astrolabe. Cost is conceptual (loss of solitary stance) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to bury the real memory—tightens once when the true betrayal seeps through. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (brass cold, damp stone) increases the cost of the lie. Price is visible in her tremor and final regret.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—prevent massacre at the exchange—tightens when the boy spits and the commander’s hand moves to weapon. Escalation is one decisive beat, but the cost (potential second boy’s death) is visceral and the commander’s renunciation is earned on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: find internal/external alignment at any cost.  Regret-backlash intensifies one long crescendo until choice crystallizes into stasis.  No conventional antagonist required; pressure builds as backward-projected ghosts become contrails of failure.  Final西洋参倒下了–moment withholds destination yet forces a irreversible halt with visible emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she act to reignite empathy?—is announced in para 1, re-energized when lake turns from dread to awe, and tested in final hand-off. Escalation follows causal lens: every choice narrows future choices until delivery becomes irreversible act with visible emotional cost (grandson’s face “hardened by years of anger” softens).

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.5)
    Motivation—reforge bond beyond death—grows from memory to cosmic renunciation. Phoenix ascent isn’t backdrop; it charges the tightening when the specter proves untouchable, raising the cost of transformation vs. resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim lost time—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accretive: each card, vision, and the spirit’s warning tightens the emotional vise until Silas renounces reclamation for presence. The tightening is driven by his agency (the unfastening) and carries visible cost (dried blood, aching clarity). No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: can grief be transmuted into passage without violence? Pressure tightens as the ship’s gravity of sorrow increases; each luminous stitch is a deliberate trade-off that spends Elara’s finite emotional stamina. The locked dimension is not a place but a frequency—her renunciation of force becomes the only viable tactic, paid for by eternal exile.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early and tightened when the volcano groans and the sand glows. Agency is renunciation: releasing the bugs forecloses her old philanthropic identity. Cost is felt in the empty jar and her seated stillness. Could be sharper if the tightening beat carried a more explicit trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—illicit redistribution of light—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Kael chooses the presses over immediate personal safety. Escalation is causal: each bypass narrows options until the final hum locks the revolution into motion. Cost is visible: if caught, Kael forfeits post and life; the ember’s glow reminds us.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore friction via sacred patterns—signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened when the spiral becomes irreversible. Agency: Kaelen’s decision to dissolve the dust rather than possess it forecloses personal triumph for global repair. Cost is the loss of his cursed but guiding visions. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for length; no secondary pressure keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. release the poem—tightens once: the rarefaction decision narrows options from hiding to weaponizing memory. Cost is the patrol sweep and the irreversible broadcast of her brother’s voice.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will this duel end in defeat or synthesis—tightens when the needle-card is decoded mid-fence, forcing alliance. Escalation is causal: each positional parry eliminates a philosophical stance until only co-creation remains. Cost is the ceded certainty; felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation intensifies through Silas’s silent nod; each climb binds trust tighter until the decision to transcribe hardens. The restraint to publish nothing against a symbol of looming authority gives the resistance its edge.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaim one stolen moment—tightens as twilight’s razor line advances. Agency drives escalation: each tool (key, compasses, clock) is repurposed under pressure, narrowing options until the final encore forecloses further pursuit. The cost is visible in the backward-spinning hands that dissolve into night, marking the irreversible limit of her reach.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect cultural memory before monsoon—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each dimming bloom. Agency: Elara’s decision to risk dream-dive narrows options; the irreversible awakening of the seed forecloses any lesser remedy. Cost is visible—she is soaked, the island’s reality forever altered—and felt in the silent shockwave. No coincidence resolves the conflict; dream interpretation yields actionable knowledge that she alone must enact.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apology—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each tactile pass over lace deepens knowledge, tightening toward acceptance. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and coherent. Cost is the irreversible severance acknowledged in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation via accumulating dust patterns narrows her options from sterile quantification to humbled acceptance; the cost ("drama was never needless") is unmistakable in the final realization that reconfigures the flood's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure accumulates through pattern recognition (frost grooves, ledger marks) narrowing options to one path. Cost legible in her relinquishment of glass art for lens-making, altering tactics immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (chased stillness vs. answering call) tightens through protagonist agency: refusal impulse → lens restoration → descent.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s failed run leading to the bell’s discovery; pressure accumulates via donation pattern until the declaration reconfigures "hope" from scarcity to partnership with felt cost of lost anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via deepening (unused love shifts from quest to vesselhood), but escalation lacks visible price that charges the final image; cost (tear's loss) is present but not woven into the climactic healing action's physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten through sensory decay (fading photos), but protagonist's paralysis limits agency-driven escalation. Cost (fragment's power) is visible, yet the solution's sudden geometric certainty undermines pressure coherence in Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes crystallize early ("buy time for seed-bearers"), with militia arrival tightening pressure under Accumulative lens. Escalation driven by Elara’s key-sorting agency, culminating in undeniable cost: "locked in" for seed preservation. No coincidental resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist’s agency when flower-code reinterpretation narrows options; felt cost crystallizes in edelweiss pocket gesture; single tightening (sabotage realization) sufficiently reweights "illuminated moments" under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through the thaw’s live clock ("race against this melt"), with the ice-sheet shatter forcing her realization; cost is legible in the "violent, cracking" emotional thaw foreclosing her icy armor.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven solely by Leo’s agency: decoding narrows options to confrontation. Dominant stake (proving vulnerability=power) tightens when Marcus arrives—no coincidence resolves tension. Cost is visceral (physical tremors) and conceptual (identity loss). Near-miss: secondary phobia stakes slightly underexploited during decryption.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes escalate purely through sensory deepening: silence's "marbled" texture and star's pulse raise cost until physical exhaustion ("arm burned") forces closure. Agency is flawless—brushstrokes narrow options to one decisive summary.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake ("where thoughts come from") tightens via timeline escalation, narrowing options to amalgamation. Agency drives climax as Unit 734 chooses to play, paying conceptual cost through irreversible understanding. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without resolution shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (mistrust thawing) tighten through doodle revelation with felt cost of vulnerability; pressure escalates via Accumulative lens. Brother's emotional shift occurs too abruptly in final beat without sufficient middle-beat resistance to test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: polishing ritual deepens stakes until the official’s arrival forces crystallization. Cost is unmistakable in his closed device—a visible worldview collapse. "The garden was not responding to luck. It was recognizing her" reconfigures options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's rewiring under Accumulative lens; twilight window narrows options to one fleeting moment. Cost unmistakable in "quiet certainty settling into bones," though slightly abstract. Dominant stake (proving temporal coexistence) tightens relentlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation via textural density (ripples → splashes → whirlpool) masterfully reweights the stake under Accumulative lens, but the single tightening lacks a visible tactical shift beyond volume increase. Cost is legible in the "deeper silence" and pounding heart, yet physical stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Elara’s agency under accumulative lens: primary sensor failure forces conduit search, narrowing options to seconds. Cost is visceral—"numb thumb," despair wave—and reconfigures stakes in the final image’s "terrible anchor."

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten via protagonist agency under accumulative lens: "appraise validity" evolves from intellectual quest to physical strain against fused valve, with visible cost in "muscles burning" and final exhaustion reconfiguring truth's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (preserve witnessing duty) tightens via sensory escalation: "tectonic groan" to "violent collapse" to foundational fracture. Keeper's agency drives escalation—burrowing through reality layers—yet cost (absorbing library's pain) lacks visible tactical consequence. Pressure narrows options effectively under Accumulative lens but cost doesn't alter post-crisis behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (Leo's silence vs. voice) escalate causally via eclipse countdown, narrowing options to "speak now or remain closed." Cost is unmistakable (tear, rusted voice), but resolution leans slightly neat—grief's complexity isn't fully tested in the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency as diary entries narrow options toward the axis revelation, with visible cost in the "heavy weight" of truth. Dominant stake (recovering lost memory) tightens coherently, though "profound nausea" description lacks visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (Leo's role in network) signaled early; escalation driven by agency (delivering specs) with cost legible in final image, but "accidental" prophecy undermines causality under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: entity's "grinding glass" rhetoric deepens pressure by weaponizing Ansel's methods, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visceral—"raw void-static washed over... agony"—and alters tactics (receiving vs. defending). Agency clear in cessation choice.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake ("succeed before exhaustion") tightens via accumulative escalation: sensory deepening (grey sky to lavender/blue ice) and memory layering narrow options. Visible cost in collapse alters final state (sleep replaces striving). Agency clear in superimposing hum despite no physical baton.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure (indigo tunnel, inverted gravity), but escalation lacks protagonist agency—procedural generation drives path choices rather than Elara's active decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens through sensory escalation: leaf-crunch vibrations to drum’s "primal voice." Cost crystallizes when abandoning the needle forecloses old solutions for new language.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens when scent cascade hits—narrowing options to endure grief or break preservation ritual; agency shown in deliberate vial-handing (not smelling it), with cost crystallized in "tears no longer solely of sorrow" as bloom fades.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation driven by Kael’s agency: arranging rope triggers vision, deepening stakes from abstract desire to annihilation of hope. Cost is unmistakable ("entire future lineage erased"), but moral calculus lacks competing goods—prison escape backstory feels thin, muting the dilemma’s visceral weight until the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through sensory escalation (shipwreck silence → absolute greenhouse quiet), resolved by Elara's agency in musical approach shift. Cost legible in the single pear's tangible fragility against vast silence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake (detachment vs authentic connection) tightens when static intensifies, forcing her agency in reversing the energy. The cost—shattered professional identity ("dealer of counterfeit emotion... wept for a stranger")—viscerally charges the final image. Escalation slightly lacks granular temporal pressure despite "grotto’s light deepened" cue.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate via meaningful deepening (letter return → photo discovery), but coincidence drives escalation (photo fall), not pure protagonist agency under accumulative lens; cost is felt but not visibly paid.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency when Elara chooses creation over exposure, reweighting "belonging" with felt cost; communal search mechanics lack specific pressure on mid-beat tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through temporal density (pendant's dissonance, giant's shallow breaths), but pressure lacks one tightening choice that narrows options before climax; cost legible but escalation slightly muted.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when data reveals "hollow zero," deepening into conceptual reweighting. Agency is fully Elara's: her despair and tactile discovery drive the shift. Cost is visceral in "wave of despair" and reframed grief's "fragile but tenacious" emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stake ("to become visible... as a presence") tightens through Silas’s agency when memory transforms his method from delivering periodicals to caching comfort books, with cost legible in his retreat into walls despite the student’s discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is pure Accumulative: the dominant stake (control vs. adaptation) deepens via sensory accumulation ("leaves mulch the soil," "roses straining") rather than external events. Elara’s agency in releasing control narrows options decisively, with cost legible in "her roots digging deeper into a truth."

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen through perception’s reweighting (mundane vs. prophetic visions), narrowing options to sharing rather than seeking. Cost is visible in Elara’s altered sight, but conflict lacks tangible pressure escalation beyond internal shift under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (combating forgetting) tightens when exile connection emerges; pressure grows through document discoveries. Agency in reframing the ship’s record forecloses mourning with conceptual cost, but "silent warning" reveal lacks sufficient resistance before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is driven entirely by Elara’s agency under the Accumulative lens: her confession narrows options from seeking entry to claiming passage. Cost is unmistakable when unspoken truths become "tangible and real," then consumed by the punch. The warden’s demand crystallizes stakes without coincidence, and the single tightening (truth for path) reweights the dominant stake with visceral precision.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: choosing to "answer his call" reweights the dominant stake (skepticism vs connection) with felt cost in her trembling purpose. Whale migration tightens decision window organically.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes viscerally felt through solar storm's live clock tightening decisions; cost unmistakable in "profound silence" replacing hushed thunder. Escalation minimal but sufficient under accumulative lens with one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: ink drops force moral calculus between her father's deceit and uncompensated good. Cost is unmistakable—"contradictions swirled like the ink"—as her worldview fractures. One decisive deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (capturing dawn's resonance) tightens via dawn's approach, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; visions happen *to* Elara rather than arising from her choices. Cost is conceptual (ephemerality of captured truth) yet feels unmoored from active trade-offs, weakening pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (giving voice to erased histories) escalates through K’s agency: layering whispers evolves into cross-referencing for cover-up proof. Meaningful tightening occurs when K shifts from passive collection to active investigation ("layered these whispers over the location"), narrowing options to anonymous disclosure with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: touch triggers hum, shell-focus crystallizes stance. Cost legible in compass fading (ephemeral truth internalized). Grandfather/father debate over-explains stakes, diluting pressure’s organic accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by Lyra's agency: encoded graffiti enables community-led adaptation, narrowing options from anxious resistance to defiant joy. Dominant stake (preserving heart vs. corporate sanitization) signaled early and tightened through visible cost (Hem's stall relocation, trust burden). Cost unmistakable in "steady resolve" after stone transfer. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens without coincidence.

    Dominant stake (reclaiming lost time) tightens via Silas's agency: blood offering → unfastening → vision escalation. Keeper's "vessel is cracked" warning raises cost visibly. Final deepening (daughter's future ritual) reweights options with undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through density of sorrow (Accumulative lens), but the resolution lacks visible trade-offs; the Kwan Yin solution resolves trauma without prior struggle or tangible cost to Elara beyond emotional labor.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when fireflies reactivate in mineral air, forcing Elara’s realization. Passive agency fits Accumulative lens, but cost (her destitution as "necessary emptiness") lacks visceral dramatization in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. power hoarding) tightens immediately via blackout. Kael's agency drives escalation: diverting energy to presses—not full restoration—shows moral calculus. Cost is legible in "cradle of sparks": system remains broken but hope persists, altering future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (restore friction) tightens through Kaelen's agency: stone arrangement → eels' response → void manifestation. Cost crystallizes in the "shudder" and "tremor" of resistance—a felt physical price that reconfigures the world's state under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (truth preservation vs dissemination) tightens when "preservation is not enough" realization reframes her agency. Escalation driven purely by protagonist's insight under accumulative lens; cost is irreversible release into danger. No redundant moves—every beat deepens the central pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen via the needle card cipher revealing alliance intent, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven cost—Kaelen's shift feels convenient, missing the required visible price for high-band entry under Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (Ezra's need to order chaos vs. fear of exposure) tightens via key discovery. Agency-driven escalation: Silas's unspoken invitation forces stance crystallization. Cost is visceral (Ezra's trembling, Silas's tears) under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency: compasses narrow path choices, horizon’s approach tightens temporal stakes. Cost crystallizes in the echo’s fleeting grace—"not a reversal, but an encore"—with visible trade-off against encroaching night under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Monsoon timeframe creates a live clock that tightens tactics (digging as rain falls), with agency driven by Elara's pouring of lived experience into the seed. Cost is unmistakable—the "luminous doubt" moment crystallizes the emotional price paid to reweight stakes before the deluge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes deepen through Elara's agency: her failed attempt to "diffuse pain" forces tactile engagement with lace, narrowing options to acceptance; the "solid, aching mass" of regret evolves into "color of peace" with felt cost in the compass's final heartbeat-like pulse.
