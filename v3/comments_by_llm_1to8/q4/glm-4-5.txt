  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under the accumulative lens. The piece maintains a steady observational tone without density increase, pattern break, or cadence shift that would reweight the dominant stake. Elena's documentation continues unchanged; no pressure forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake (discovering who tried to kill her) is established but never faces real pressure or escalation—Lena methodically examines plates without opposition, time constraints, or mounting danger. The revelation arrives through convenient pattern-matching rather than earned struggle. No meaningful tightening occurs; she simply interprets symbols until reaching a conclusion without cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - Elena strikes the tuning fork, observes patterns, and declares success without obstacles or opposition. The dominant stake (translating silence to music) never faces a test or complication. The resolution arrives through simple observation rather than earned struggle, with no visible price for her achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal haunting to cosmic duty as Elias discovers the library's purpose. The dominant stake—finding peace with mortality—tightens when he must choose between returning to his undertaker life or accepting eternal guardianship. Cost is visible in his transformation, though the middle section could apply more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—community survival through solidarity—is clear from the opening, with sanctions creating persistent external pressure. The tightening occurs through checkpoint restrictions and northern settlement's additional sanctions, forcing Elias's decision to expand despite scarcity. While this escalation works under the Accumulative lens, the cost remains more declared than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure builds through Elara's breathing method revealing past-life faces and transforming unused love into light, with cost visible in her tears. The stakes deepen appropriately for this contemplative mode, though the extended epilogue dissipates rather than heightens the earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes center on Elara's desire to understand time's texture, with one meaningful deepening when the halo fragment returns and she chooses merger over safety. The middle section's documentation and sketching lacks escalating pressure under the Accumulative lens—the "quaking reverie" in her study doesn't materially alter her options or impose new costs.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (saving seeds before demolition) is clear but escalation is minimal—the story progresses through discovery and retrieval without meaningful tightening until workers arrive early. This single complication resolves too easily with her convenient escape "just as she slipped out through a back door." The conflict lacks the persistent pressure or narrowing options that would force harder choices or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake - capturing the sound of trust breaking - is clear, but escalation occurs primarily through description rather than active pressure. The story deepens through accumulation of details about Kael's method and environment, fitting the textural lens. However, there's no moment where Kael faces a choice that would cost him something tangible; his discovery arrives through patient listening rather than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from simple theft to identity revelation, with the flower code creating a tightening window of opportunity. The final choice to preserve rather than steal represents agency with cost, though the middle lacks genuine resistance—the stationmaster's easy deception reduces tension where the story most needs pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—emotional healing through creative work—progresses through accumulation rather than escalation. While the melting ice provides temporal pressure and Elias moves from abandonment to creation, there's no meaningful tightening that forces a trade-off or crystallizes cost beyond gentle metaphorical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes escalate from personal identity crisis to survival against The Production, with the approaching midnight deadline adding pressure. However, the conflict resolution relies heavily on Maya's internal realization rather than dramatized struggle. The Production remains vague as antagonists, and Maya's "outwitting" happens through emotional acceptance rather than concrete action with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsession to species survival as the oracle realizes she must "guide others through" darkness. The tightening occurs when the last star vanishes entirely, forcing immediate action. Cost appears in the oracle's isolation and the terrified masses below, though the middle section could show more concrete pressure between setup and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (understanding consciousness origin) maintains coherence but escalation relies heavily on the single violin encounter without building pressure. The looped timeline visions provide texture but don't create genuine choice-forcing pressure. Cost remains abstract rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=4.4)
    The central conflict—whether to use the lens's power—emerges late and resolves quickly without genuine struggle. No meaningful escalation occurs; Elara's discovery leads directly to renunciation without intermediate pressure or temptation. The stakes remain abstract (community mistrust) rather than viscerally felt through specific consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=4.8)
    While there's a nominal stake (proving gardens know their gardeners), it never faces concrete opposition or test on the page. The scientists' impending visit creates anticipation but no actual conflict occurs. The story lacks the meaningful tightening or deepening required - Elias simply continues his routine without facing pressure that would force adaptation or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain intellectual throughout—proving "time moves sideways" never faces genuine opposition or risk. The three-lever sequence shows methodical progression but no escalation of pressure or narrowing of options. The bird's multi-dimensional awareness confirms rather than complicates Aris's theory, and success arrives without forcing any trade-off or revealing unexpected cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—completing the ghost's unfinished performance—is signaled early and tightens as Elias decodes the water-stained notation. The program's dissolution provides visible cost. However, escalation remains gentle rather than pressured, with no significant obstacles between discovery and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes emerge through Elias's need to understand what he "swallowed" during delirium, but escalation remains largely internal without meaningful tightening. The revelation about coordinates and the cave system advances knowledge but doesn't force a decisive trade-off or demonstrate cost beyond Elias walking into the cold.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—finding "the weight of a swallowed truth"—remains abstract throughout. No meaningful escalation occurs; Marcus experiences visions but faces no opposition or difficult choice. The radio confession creates momentary tension but dissolves without forcing any decision or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—witnessing without being absorbed—intensifies when the keeper encounters the silence's "tempting stasis." The tension between preservation and entropy deepens through the journey, with the keeper's "loose grip on reality" becoming both vulnerability and tool. Cost is visible in the active resistance required.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—breaking through Lila's silence—is clear from early setup. The eclipse provides temporal pressure and Maya's drumming invitation creates the turning point. However, escalation feels gentle rather than pressurized, and the three-month buildup is told rather than shown, reducing the sense of accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (preserving stories before they fade) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or complication. The historian discovers the tapestry and diaries without obstacle, interprets them without struggle, and continues their work unchanged. No meaningful tightening occurs; the discovery adds knowledge but doesn't narrow options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the story maintains steady exposition about the writer's ongoing practice without any tightening of options or rising cost. The dominant stake (transforming humanity's consciousness) remains abstract and untested. There's no reversal, complication, or deepening that forces a choice; the writer simply continues his established routine with philosophical satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly through the loop pedal layers building toward the entity's dissolution. The rhetorical paradox ("Can that which is eternal be contained in that which is temporary?") creates a satisfying intellectual trap. However, the entity offers minimal resistance, reducing tension - Sarah's writhing is the only physical manifestation of struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.8)
    While exhaustion provides a ticking clock and memories accumulate toward the symphony's crescendo, the escalation lacks genuine resistance or complication—the protagonist simply closes his eyes, recalls memories, and achieves his goal. The story needs an obstacle or reversal that would force a harder choice and make the final achievement feel earned rather than granted.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding his gravity-defying nature—is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or cost. The eclipse creates a temporal window but no real urgency or trade-off. The resolution ("accepting all parts of himself") arrives without foreclosing options or paying a visible price, failing the escalation requirements under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (defeating emotional numbness) is clear, and Eleanor's discovery of backward recordings provides one meaningful deepening. However, escalation lacks true pressure—the discovery comes too easily without setbacks, and no competing forces or time constraints create urgency. The cost of deafness is established but not actively tested through conflicting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (exposing weather manipulation) escalates from suspicion to confirmation to action, with Elias's choice carrying clear risk of detection. The pressure tightens once when he discovers the conspiracy proof, though the resolution relies on the convenient arrival of the security pigeon rather than earned confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (understanding grief triggers) is clear but escalation is minimal - mostly accumulation of memories rather than rising pressure. The ghost orchid's transformation provides external tension but doesn't meaningfully complicate Elias's choices. The resolution comes through passive revelation rather than active decision under pressure, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract—"impossible choices humanity now faced" never materializes in concrete pressure on the poet. The exploration proceeds without opposition or cost, pattern-building without resistance, and resolution arrives through contemplation alone rather than tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning after environmental catastrophe—is clear, with Kael's musical discovery providing resolution. The escalation from practicing alone to family gathering to breakthrough performance shows progression. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance or complication; the transformation arrives too easily without sufficient pressure forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful conflict emerges—the transformation proceeds smoothly from preparation through completion without resistance, complication, or cost. The client never speaks or acts, existing only as a canvas for Elias's work. Stakes remain abstract ("emotional fulfillment") without concrete consequences for failure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (recognizing silent contributors) develops through concrete actions: envelope delivery, funding arrangement, reciprocal professional benefits. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias commits resources to the archive project. However, escalation plateaus after the funding resolution, and the years-later scene lacks new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake of belonging escalates from fleeting connections through collaborative search to discovered kinship, with the sigil revelation providing the key turn. The shared exhaustion and laughter during the search creates authentic pressure, though the actual climbing sequences could use more specific physical challenges.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation through time pressure as the giant stirs toward waking, forcing the illustrator to borrow increasingly from his future. The dominant stake (restoring natural rhythm before reality is altered) tightens effectively. Cost is legible in the depleted lifespan, though the actual mechanics of how the giant's dreams would "alter reality" remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes center on understanding emotion's mathematics and finding the mentor, with one meaningful deepening when the mosaic patterns shift to reveal new understanding. However, escalation remains largely internal without external pressure or trade-offs—Elara performs her ritual without obstacles, and the vision arrives without cost or struggle that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (helping while remaining hidden) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or test. The tape discovery represents accumulation rather than escalation—no options narrow, no prices are paid. The protagonist's decision to continue their established pattern lacks the tightening or deepening that would create cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulating evidence that challenges Elara's worldview, with each storm bringing stronger counter-examples to her control methods. The stakes deepen when she opens greenhouse vents during the storm, risking destruction for potential growth.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena will exchange her talisman for artistic purpose—creates genuine tension with visible cost. The brooch's warmth against "sleepless nights" establishes what she risks losing. However, escalation is modest; after the exchange, the story shifts to summary mode about her later success rather than dramatizing the immediate consequences of her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal disorientation ("visions swirled with chaos") to cosmic participation in creation. The pearl activates shadows that "inhabit" crystals, forcing Elara's stance crystallization. However, the middle lacks concrete opposition—shadows arrive but don't truly threaten, reducing felt pressure despite the conceptual shift.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract—"compiling fragments into meaning" never faces concrete opposition or cost. The dominant tension (understanding the past to heal the present) doesn't escalate through pressure but through information accumulation. No meaningful tightening occurs; each vision adds data without narrowing Elina's options.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering truth versus maintaining analytical certainty—develops through Ethan's progression deeper into the vault, with each step "a dare against his analytical nature." The conflict tightens as the vault begins to flicker, forcing a decision to accept or reject the transformation. While agency drives the resolution, the escalation could push harder against Ethan's resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract—"helping others" and "understanding significance" never face concrete tests or opposition. The story lacks escalation under any lens; Elara's activities (transcribing, inviting visitors) proceed without meaningful resistance or cost that would force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (understanding what comes after goodbye/restoring dimensional balance) is signaled early but escalation occurs through discovery rather than active pressure—Alistair observes rebellions without facing direct opposition. The solar storm creates urgency but doesn't force difficult choices. Cost appears in the escondite's collapse and accepting the guardian role, though neither involves genuine struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.9)
    While stakes are declared (Maya's job/freedom vs. Dr. Thorne's life), the conflict lacks immediate pressure - the break-in proceeds exactly as planned with no complications or reversals. The "mathematics of fair trade" remains abstract rather than forcing a concrete choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the dominant stake (preserving temporal textures) is clear, there's minimal escalation or pressure. The dawn ritual proceeds without complication or choice-forcing tension. The town's silence suggests loss but doesn't create active conflict that tests Elias's commitment or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout - the narrator seeks identity and stories but faces no concrete opposition or meaningful obstacles. No escalation occurs under the accumulative lens; the piece maintains a steady contemplative register without deepening pressure or forcing trade-offs. The dominant stake of reclaiming identity never faces a concrete test.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (decoding the universal riddle) is signaled early and progresses through discovery of artifacts to playing the cello to understanding past debates. Escalation occurs through accumulation—each artifact deepens Evelyn's engagement—though tension plateaus rather than tightens since no real opposition emerges. The resolution lands through Evelyn's synthesis but lacks visible cost; her myth-buster identity never truly risks anything.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.9)
    While privatization creates external pressure, Maya faces no meaningful reversals or forced trade-offs—every action succeeds without complication. The stakes (preserving culture vs. development) remain abstract rather than visceral. The resolution arrives too easily through anonymous proposals without Maya risking exposure or choosing between their dual allegiances with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—documenting the fireflies before extinction—is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or complication. Elena simply waits for the optimal moment and succeeds without obstacle or trade-off. The chemical timing device creates false tension but doesn't force any meaningful choice or reveal any cost beyond the pre-existing extinction.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining connection despite separation—is signaled early and deepens through the repair act. Pressure exists but doesn't significantly escalate; the repair proceeds smoothly without meaningful complications or reversals. The cost (separation) is established but not intensified through the action, limiting the escalation under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where rivers begin—escalates from academic obsession to spiritual revelation, with the condensation patterns deepening Elmsley's understanding at each appearance. The cost manifests in his transformation from dry wit to reverence, though the middle journey lacks concrete obstacles. The final reconciliation between "mathematics alone could never reveal" and indigenous wisdom creates meaningful tension resolved through earned synthesis.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each footstep compounds the restoration effect—windowpane fusing, beam straightening, bell tower recovering. The dominant stake (preventing collapse through harmonic restoration) is signaled early and deepens through visible transformations. Agency manifests through Silas's precise, deliberate choices that foreclose the path of decay.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The oxygen countdown creates escalating pressure that forces Elena's decisive action. The tightening occurs when she must choose between retreat and advancing to the sealed chamber. However, the rescue arrival undermines the full weight of the established life-or-death stakes, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.8)
    While time pressure exists ("before they find the bodies"), it never materializes into concrete stakes or forces actual choices. The conflict remains entirely internal without external pressure testing the protagonist's resolve. No meaningful tightening occurs—the protagonist's situation and options remain unchanged from beginning to end despite the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—repaying the debt to enable rebirth—is signaled early but develops through exposition rather than escalating pressure. The midnight awakening provides one meaningful tightening when the bead connects with roots below, but most conflict resolution occurs through backstory revelation rather than present-scene struggle. Cost lands in the bride's dissolution but lacks intermediate pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract—"transforming ruin into reverence" never faces concrete opposition or requires trade-offs. The transformation happens without resistance, cost, or meaningful escalation; villagers simply witness and approve rather than creating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation rather than reversal - from curiosity to purpose to spiritual completion. The dominant stake (completing an interrupted journey) tightens as each sundial piece reveals ancestral stories and demands greater commitment. Cost becomes visible through tears and the "weight of exile" lifting, though pressure could intensify more sharply in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's understanding of her work's meaning—evolves through accumulation rather than active conflict. The noon deadline provides external pressure, but escalation occurs primarily through internal realization. The piece lacks concrete opposition; surveillance society remains atmospheric rather than actively threatening.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—preventing the coup without revealing Elara's true abilities—escalates through her discovery of the conspiracy in galaxy alignments and her decision to introduce "calculated delays." The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as whispers become conspiracy becomes action. Cost appears in the necessity of maintaining her foolish persona while lives hang in balance, though the specific human cost of the coup remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on emotional resolution—finding the unspoken truth between Elara and the departed. The escalation from "I'm sorry" to "I was afraid" to Elara's "I forgive" creates meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost appears in Elara's emotional journey and the "fractures in her understanding," though the resolution comes somewhat easily without testing her limits or forcing harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (helping child process father's loss) is clear but escalation is minimal—mostly reflection rather than rising pressure. The story lacks a meaningful tightening that narrows options; Kaelen's choice to comfort Lina faces no real opposition or cost beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and develops through Amelia's technical process of revealing the fragment's hidden images. The conflict deepens when she must convince doubting council members ("ancient dust"), creating modest resistance. However, the resolution arrives too easily through visitor enthusiasm without meaningful opposition or trade-offs that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.4)
    The five awakenings provide escalation through accumulation, but each arrives without resistance or struggle. Elena's transformation from certainty to curiosity lacks opposition—she simply receives increasingly complex insights without meaningful obstacles. The cost of abandoning her "methodically playful" approach for pure curiosity never manifests as loss or difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are clearly established (thought taxation threatening human consciousness) but escalation remains lateral—adding more communication methods rather than tightening pressure. The story lacks a meaningful turn where Kaelen faces actual cost or narrowed options on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (transforming pain into beauty) signals early and progresses through the blossom armistice, but escalation reads as summary across centuries rather than dramatized pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs—the poet continues the same action (composing verses) without narrowing options or facing trade-offs until the abstract death at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake of preserving memory against inevitable loss is signaled early and deepens when Eleth discovers the cracked chime. The restoration process creates tension through its delicacy and the revelation of newly recovered names. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful tightening that would foreclose options—the restoration succeeds without significant trade-offs or complications that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes are declared (preventing permanent division) but never tested on-page through concrete opposition or choice. The deadline creates nominal urgency but doesn't force trade-offs or escalate pressure through the scene. Elena's work proceeds without meaningful obstacles or cost—she simply translates until breakthrough occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding balance between preservation and progress—is clear from "Tomorrow, debate would resume." Pressure builds through Elara's discoveries, each narrowing her options toward the seasonal lake solution. However, the conflict lacks immediate opposition; everything unfolds too smoothly without meaningful resistance or complication that would force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to preserve lost songs and reconnect with her past—develops through discovering the meteorite, learning to read dust patterns, and finally writing the letter to restart her service. The escalation from hiding to action shows meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the middle section lacks a clear tightening moment that would heighten pressure before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through pattern accumulation—from analyzing random wood grain to recognizing the crucial oak doorway pattern. The cost becomes tangible in "necessary distances that had grown between them," though middle beats could tighten the pressure between discovery and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of finding belonging accumulates through discovery rather than conflict—Maya encounters no meaningful obstacles or reversals. The creatures simply respond positively to her presence without cost or trade-off, and the feather's transformation arrives without earned pressure or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—remains largely intellectual without visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central conflict between memory preservation and the ban exists only in backstory - no Council agents arrive, no immediate threat tests Lira's resolve. The transformation proceeds without opposition or complication. Stakes remain abstract rather than embodied in scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens. The stone-throwing creates ripples that trigger reflection, but there's no tightening pressure or deepening that forces a choice. Mara's "realization" arrives without opposition or cost—she simply understands her purpose more clearly without sacrificing anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (translating personal trauma into universal meaning) deepens through reflection rather than external pressure. The internal shift from isolation to connection shows meaningful psychological cost. Limited by lack of present-scene opposition beyond internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict or escalation occurs - Elian methodically implements his plan without opposition or complication. The gauge spinning faster represents ornamental intensification without causal pressure. The story lacks a tightening that forecloses options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream about—deepens from curiosity to responsibility as Elara uncovers Thorne's work. The escalation from recording echoes to finding documents to developing the negative creates meaningful pressure, though the resolution relies more on conceptual understanding than dramatized choice. Cost becomes visible in accepting the "weight" of continuing the work.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on the painter's annual attempt to access mirror possibilities, with pressure building through the narrow window before bells. The ritual succeeds but the tension plateaus once she begins humming—there's no complication or resistance, just accumulation toward inevitable success.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract ("centuries of bloodshed," "forever war") without concrete on-page pressure that forces specific choices. The negotiation itself is summarized rather than dramatized—we're told about "mapping shared resources" and "concession of ancestral lands" without seeing these as active conflicts. No meaningful escalation occurs; the story maintains a steady reflective tone throughout without a tightening that narrows options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory versus accepting destruction—deepens through Silas's journey to the center where "cracks converged like spokes." His agency drives the release decision with visible cost of giving up the egg. However, escalation is primarily internal without external pressure, and the rain's arrival, while thematically resonant, reduces the sense of earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—freedom from conformity—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. Elara's "untangling threads" proceeds without resistance, setback, or meaningful choice under pressure. The escalation reads as accumulation of mystical imagery rather than tightening constraints, and no visible price is paid for her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—challenging harmful narratives through puppet shows—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The audience's skepticism dissolves too easily without testing Elias's commitment. No meaningful tightening occurs; the story ends exactly where it began with Elias serene and planning his next show, lacking the foreclosed path or trade-off required for escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory of ecological catastrophe—intensifies through the contrast between past abundance ("thousands of monarchs") and present scarcity ("single traveler remained"). The knotting ritual deepens as "each knot represented a generation lost," building textural pressure. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal pilgrimage to preserving all names. The reconfiguration sequence creates genuine tension through "technically gentle" precision required. Cost is visible - Elara sacrifices her freedom to become keeper, though the middle could use more immediate pressure before the rope work begins.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.5)
    The storm's approach creates temporal pressure and the ritual represents a meaningful deepening as Elara attempts to bridge her temporal gap. Stakes feel somewhat abstract despite the "half her life" cost declaration; the conflict lacks visceral resistance or concrete obstacles to her transcendence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving/unlocking ancient knowledge before the regime change—is signaled early and tightens as Nebuchadnezzar approaches. The escalation follows the textural lens appropriately with increasing ritual intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—capturing versus freeing the runaway dream—is signaled early and tested through the repair process, with one meaningful deepening when the mirror maker sees through the transformed sextant. However, escalation relies heavily on description rather than active pressure, and the final choice to free the dream lacks dramatic opposition or visible trade-off beyond the abstract notion of what his workshop "will become."

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake of reconnection with her daughter is signaled early and deepens through Elara's bridge-building, with meaningful tightening when she discovers the ribbon's disappearance and seed placement. However, the daughter's agency remains entirely off-page, and the resolution relies on coincidence (the overnight bloom) rather than earned pressure. The cost of years of separation is felt but not actively tested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Elias moves from discovery to contemplation to enlightenment without encountering resistance or paying visible costs.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking lost identity pieces to accepting responsibility for all forgotten lives—a meaningful deepening that narrows Elara's options. The cost is legible when she accepts "trapped freedom," able to access infinite memories but "bound to never fully live them."

    Stakes escalate from academic curiosity to temporal manipulation with irreversible consequences. The pressure tightens as Eleanor must decide whether to reconfigure the rope without knowing if she can return.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are clear—preserving the ripple marks—but escalation is minimal. The bloom of hush works on first attempt without setback or adjustment, and the energy beings offer no meaningful resistance before harmonizing.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - proving meaning exists through rekindling the beacon - is signaled early and deepens through Elara's revelation about the "shard of hush." The story shows one meaningful tightening when she aligns the prism with ancient star positions. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost; "fragile light...would not last forever" states rather than embodies the price.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract—preserving collective memory—without concrete opposition or cost. While Elthion moves from observatory to forecourt and his understanding "crystallizes," no actual pressure forces a choice between competing options, and the resolution simply affirms his existing purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—defying hopelessness through fireworks—is signaled early and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through Elias's precise adjustments creating measurable effects on passengers, with the approaching storm providing temporal urgency. The escalation from individual comfort (crying woman) to collective transformation shows clear accumulative deepening, though stakes could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake (completing the ritual before sunrise) is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition. Each obstacle dissolves "politely" without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options.

Without genuine escalation or a moment where Elara must sacrifice something tangible, the conflict remains conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are established early (Maya's desire for redemption and transformation), but escalation remains minimal—she ventures into dangerous areas but faces no actual danger or setback. The dominant stake of personal transformation through the quantum promise holds throughout. The resolution arrives through discovery rather than earned struggle, with coincidence (the pressure plate's convenient presence) enabling rather than complicating the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are clear (ending a dynasty through revealing truth) but escalation is minimal - the protagonist turns a crank and waits for resonance without meaningful obstacles or rising pressure. The discovery happens too smoothly, lacking the resistance that would create genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—capturing "the shape of possibility"—is signaled early and deepens through Galen's study of the marionette program, with escalation occurring as he moves from reading to practicing to the decisive "unsnap" gesture. The cost is legible in his "irrevocable" change and new burden as reality's guardian. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or meaningful resistance; Galen's transformation proceeds without substantive obstacles beyond his own trembling hesitation, limiting the tension that would elevate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor seeking connection through archival work—develops through her dust pattern investigation. The button discovery creates genuine tension about its origin. However, escalation plateaus during the extended file reading section, and Benjamin's arrival feels convenient rather than earned through Eleanor's investigative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (preserving histories before deletion) is signaled early and escalates through tripled security patrols, the dawn deadline, and final discovery by authorities.

However, Theodor's convenient appearance with exactly the needed information deflates earned tension, and the escape feels too easy given the established threat level.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (silencing the prophecy) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition—Ethan simply plays his saxophone and succeeds without encountering obstacles or having to adapt his approach.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (decoding prophecy for dwellers below) is established early but remains static until the moonstone appears. This discovery deepens the stakes by signaling "utmost importance," but the escalation is passive—Elara doesn't choose or sacrifice anything to earn this revelation. The warning about "changing winds" lacks specificity about what must be traded or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (recovering lost wisdom) is clear, but escalation is limited - Elias moves from searching to accepting to creating without significant opposing pressure. The internal conflict resolves too smoothly. "What if he could redeem his failure" arrives without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—bridging a violent dispute through reimagined narrative—is clear from "For weeks, Elias had struggled to devise a way."

However, the resolution lacks concrete opposition or cost; the representatives accept his manuscript with "growing astonishment" too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clear (all music lost by midnight) and pressure builds through the ticking clock.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=4.8)

The arrival of people at the end suggests success without showing the struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal archival work to preserving an entire civilization's emotional patterns before its fall.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Central stake of understanding/preserving the covenant deepens meaningfully when the box's requirement is revealed—"listened more than they had spoken"—forcing the recluse to choose silence. The anniversary timing creates natural pressure for the opening ritual. Cost is visible when the recluse accepts their role as eternal keeper. However, escalation relies heavily on discovery rather than active choice until the final third, and the golden bee's dissolution lacks clear causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake of "understanding time's texture" is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or test—Elara simply discovers, interprets, and succeeds without meaningful obstacles or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal mystery to survival journey to community discovery, with each phonograph cylinder deepening the quest.

Would score higher with more immediate physical pressure during the journey itself.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict or escalation occurs—Elara faces only abstract internal tensions about isolation versus purpose that never manifest in concrete choices.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through Elara's walking patterns spelling "remember" then "witness," with meaningful deepening when a pawn materializes from her work.

However, the conflict remains primarily internal without external opposition testing her methods.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding "the shape of home"—is signaled early and deepens through Maven's discoveries.

The resolution lands with earned cost (years of searching transformed into understanding), though middle escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (achieving forgiveness) is signaled but never faces concrete on-page test - the tutor's tapestry work is described as methodical but we don't see him struggle with specific choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes are declared early (defiance versus conformity) but never face concrete on-page test. The Ritual Overseers "shadow her movements" but never act, creating anticipation without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes accumulate through Marcel's systematic tracing of scars that match his "fractured consciousness," with the workshop's physical tilt embodying his emotional turbulence.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.9)

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to understand the stranger's gesture—escalates through borrowed memories that accumulate pressure, forcing him to sort foreign experiences from his own.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—how Elara will respond to Leo's secret—builds through anticipation and crystallizes in her artistic transformation. The secret triggers genuine change in her understanding of her craft, forcing her to reconsider capturing "the way moments changed people." However, withholding the secret's content reduces its pressure, and Leo's arrival feels predetermined rather than fraught with active conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—making sense of mortality through chronicling dreams—intensifies through the vision sequence where Elias soars through fractured timelines.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—"unify scattered cosmic fragments" and "balance cosmic powers" never translate into concrete pressure with visible cost.

No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; the journey proceeds without opposition or genuine choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.2)

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding these mysterious observers—escalates from passive observation to active communication through the laser network, culminating in the partnership formation.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving analog craft before digital transition—is signaled early but faces no real opposition or complication, as the digitization is already decided and the archivist simply performs his ritual unopposed. The conflict remains entirely internal and philosophical without external pressure forcing difficult choices, and the resolution requires no sacrifice beyond accepting predetermined change.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—curing loneliness—is clear from the start, but escalation occurs entirely through summary ("Three days later," "By week's end") rather than dramatized beats with rising pressure.

The resolution arrives without visible cost or trade-off beyond the irony that believers won't know his name.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding peace with grief—is signaled early but escalation remains internal and abstract. The journey deepens through memory surfacing and melody intensifying, but lacks concrete obstacles or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are clear from the opening—Elena's determination to preserve herself and reconnect with Theo. The four-minute window creates genuine time pressure that forces action.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central conflict - proving whispers outperform shouts - escalates through Marlo's calculated positioning and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=3.8)
    The "half-spoken secret" is declared as stakes but never materializes into concrete pressure or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    The central conflict—rigid education versus creative thinking—remains abstract without concrete opposition. No character or system pushes back against Arthur's rebellion; the town simply transforms without resistance, making the stakes feel theoretical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: finding scrimshaw → text emerging → whale call → ritual → transformation, each narrowing Mara's path toward irreversible change. The cost is legible in her loss of physical form and separation from the known world. Minor deduction for the convenience of the whale's timing and the somewhat abstract nature of internal barriers dissolving.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on emotional authenticity versus performance in a post-mandate world, with tension building through accumulation of ritualistic acts. The conflict between "fraud" and "saint" interpretations creates genuine ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    The conflict remains largely internal and abstract—"boundaries between reality and imagination beginning to thin"—without concrete opposition or meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the botanical arrangement's completion, building pressure as "an interrupted pattern could mean dire consequences."

The accumulative pressure coheres well under the textural lens, though the transformation feels slightly predetermined rather than genuinely risky.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=4.8)

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (transforming grief into purpose) is clear but remains largely static after establishment.

Elena's work continues without encountering obstacles or costs that would escalate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding/preventing future collapses through pattern mapping—is signaled early and maintained throughout. The visitor's arrival creates a meaningful deepening as Elias moves from solitary work to collaboration, though this shift lacks visceral cost or trade-off. The revelation that patterns could "prevent future crashes, not just predict them" reweights the project's significance but doesn't force a difficult choice or visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake - recovering forbidden knowledge - remains consistent but static. Escalation occurs through the atoms becoming "more active and visible" and visions intensifying, fitting the accumulative lens. However, the "steadily unpredictable" atoms create only mild complications without genuine risk until the unanticipated merger, which arrives without sufficient resistance or trade-off consideration.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional cataloging to personal recognition as the shadow "approached her observation station without hesitation," forcing Elara's confrontation with her lost friend. The cost materializes in her permanent state of "luminous regret" and transformed mission, though the resolution relies somewhat on the shadow's agency rather than Elara's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake (rebuilding trust after betrayal) is signaled but never faces concrete pressure in the present scene—no actual choice between self-respect and compassion materializes on the page. The conflict remains entirely internal and retrospective without escalation or a tightening that would narrow Elara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—learning to heal through integration rather than excavation—emerges clearly but escalation remains gentle. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Elara understands the coffee rings' pattern and enters the tunnel, but this feels more like revelation than pressure-driven choice. The "displaced miracle" needing return provides external goal but lacks concrete opposition or cost that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—releasing trapped love—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. Elena's discovery deepens understanding but doesn't force difficult choices or trade-offs. The "hushed thunder" builds atmosphere but represents internal revelation rather than external pressure that would force stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake - freeing trapped creativity - is signaled early but remains static throughout. No meaningful escalation occurs; Elara performs a ritual that succeeds without complication or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on preserving fractured realities before "unlit corners" collapse entirely, with escalation through the guard's progression from passive observation to active cultivation of sparks. The chess clock's single tick at 00:01 represents meaningful deepening that changes the guard's capacity. However, the conflict lacks a clear oppositional force or substantial trade-off; the transformation comes without significant on-page resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through sensory layering and pattern recognition as Kaelen decodes the forest's language. The gear warming and the forest responding create escalation, though the stakes remain abstract—we never feel what failure would cost or what he risks by continuing.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering "where unused courage waits"—drives the journey, with the star stamp's increasing heat providing escalation. The guides' agency manifests through their collective decision to seek personal understanding rather than ferry passengers. However, the journey lacks meaningful resistance or complication; the discovery feels inevitable rather than hard-won, and no clear trade-off or sacrifice appears beyond accepting new responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal recovery to collective liberation as the bellhop discovers the fortress's true nature. The choice between safety and freedom carries clear cost ("unpardonable silence"), with his singing risking the sanctuary. One meaningful deepening through discovery drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.6)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through the library's accelerating collapse and increasingly urgent ancestral messages. However, the revelation that Elara created her own antagonist deflates rather than intensifies stakes. The story lacks a middle development where Elara's actions meaningfully narrow her options before the final discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why paths disappear—remains intellectual throughout without escalating pressure. Marina's discovery unfolds through passive data comparison rather than active conflict. No meaningful tightening occurs; she begins observing and ends observing, with the revelation creating no visible change in her circumstances or forcing any trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the story signals seeking "meaning in the mess" early, no genuine escalation occurs—the protagonist walks unopposed through the space and experiences automatic enlightenment upon entering the circle. The "thunderous serenity" and growing hum provide textural intensification but no actual pressure that narrows options. The resolution arrives through magical coincidence (finding the circle) rather than earned agency, with no visible price paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake of evolving tradition versus adherence is clear early. There's meaningful escalation from discovering telepathy to finding the embryo to decoding the kite. However, the conflict lacks genuine opposition - no council member appears to challenge Maya, and the "weeks" of frustration with the sealed chamber deflate rather than build tension.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through the anniversary's approach and Maya's evolving relationship with her coping mechanisms, from private ritual to teaching children. The final release at the cliff carries weight because we've seen her daily caresses of the photograph, though the stakes could tighten more dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor recovering her artistic spark—is clear from the opening. Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through the thread-untangling sequence and the walls' breathing presence. However, the escalation lacks genuine resistance; each step forward proceeds without setback or complication, and the resolution arrives through insight rather than costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding temporal distortion during crisis—drives the experiment with the ink patterns. Escalation occurs through the sequence: eclipse observation → ink preparation → stepping into patterns → temporal displacement → return with understanding. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or meaningful opposition; the tracker faces mainly internal/intellectual challenges without clear cost tradeoffs until the final experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from discovery through moral dilemma to irreversible action with clear personal risk. The pressure tightens as Elena moves from frozen indecision to swift action, though the opposition remains largely abstract (the Federation as entity rather than immediate threat).

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation or pressure exists—Rhiannon faces no opposition, makes no difficult choices, and pays no cost. The story presents a static situation of peaceful gardening without any tightening of options or deepening that would test her values. Even under an Accumulative lens, there's no density increase or pattern break that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.9)
    Escalation occurs through the accumulation of woven emotions and the goddess's eventual descent, but lacks concrete opposition or meaningful tightening. The fisher's agency drives the capture, yet no competing force or internal struggle creates genuine pressure—the task unfolds without visible risk or trade-off until the abstract transformation at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes center on clearing an innocent man and exposing corruption, but the investigation proceeds without meaningful obstacles or pressure that would force trade-offs. Eleanor works undisturbed through the night, and her "proof by contradiction" method encounters no resistance that would test her commitment or exact a price.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - silencing guilt through reconnection - is clear early. Escalation builds as Elias moves from passive listening to active manipulation of the firmware. The temporal folding creates pressure that forces the confrontation, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once the connection is made.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure builds through the zealots' threat to "restore order," forcing Silas to act through his art rather than argument, with the mandala's dissolution representing accepted impermanence. The stakes deepen as individual understanding expands to collective revelation, though the conflict resolves somewhat easily once the patterns become visible.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming identity through naming—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of memories and the gathering of witnesses, building to the naming ritual. However, the conflict lacks concrete opposition or cost; Elias faces no meaningful resistance to his action, and the transformation occurs without visible sacrifice or trade-off beyond abstract "revolutionary kindness."

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal performance to garden's survival, with clear deadline pressure (before dawn). Silas's agency drives the resolution through his singing, with visible cost as he pours his essence into the performance, though the "fractured timeline" threat could be more concretely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared (helping telepathy pill victims, saving her brother) but never face concrete on-page test. Maya discovers a protocol but doesn't implement it or encounter meaningful obstacles. No visible cost or trade-off occurs; the resolution arrives through observation rather than pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding what transpired during hibernation—escalates from general exploration to personal calling when Maya discovers the fossil. The pressure tightens as she descends deeper into older emotional imprints, culminating in her acceptance of the translator role. However, the fossil's cooperation comes too easily without meaningful resistance or trade-off that would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake of transforming prophecy into possibility is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The discovery unfolds without resistance—the echo cooperates, the buttons organize easily, visitors arrive willingly—creating accumulation without pressure or meaningful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from passive standing to active snow-coding to the pillbox opening revealing his daughter's photo, forcing the decisive turn toward reclamation. The dominant stake—recovering authentic purpose after betrayal—tightens when he realizes fixing requires "accepting the fractures." However, the middle section's reflection on courage location feels static, and the cost remains primarily internal without external consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.6)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the coachman performs his ritual without opposition or complication. The story mentions "desperate crossings" and "promises made in haste" but these remain backstory rather than present pressure. The needle pricks his thumb, a minimal stake that doesn't alter his course. Under the Accumulative lens, needed density increase or pattern break to reweight the dominant stake never materializes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understanding why places resist decay—is signaled early and develops through accumulating discoveries. However, escalation remains observational without forcing difficult choices; Kael faces no opposition or trade-offs, just progressively deeper understanding without visible cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake - Mara's need to "reflect light into dark corners" - is signaled early and tested when she encounters Jim. However, escalation remains gentle rather than pressured. The story opts for accumulative resonance over conflict-driven tension, which fits the textural lens but limits dramatic pressure. The final "cost" is primarily understanding rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Elena's struggle between isolation and independence—is clear, with pressure building through the "brittle awakenings" pattern. The conflict deepens as she learns coexistence rather than control, though the escalation relies more on accumulation of understanding than active pressure points. The cost of abandoning her species' way is present but could be more dramatically contested.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (finding creative connection) is signaled early but lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens—no density increase or pattern break heightens pressure. Elara's discovery happens through passive observation rather than agency. The resolution arrives without a tightening that forecloses options or extracts visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are clear (humanity manipulated vs. freedom) with one meaningful escalation when Elara activates the transmitter. The tension builds adequately but lacks intermediate reversals or complications; success comes too easily without the tricksters fighting back or Elara facing real opposition beyond faculty dismissal.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal claustrophobia through societal rebellion to dimensional breakthrough, with the fallow period creating time pressure. The "spatial mutiny" carries clear risk of being branded a traitor. However, the actual opposition feels abstract - no concrete antagonistic force challenges Elara's progress, making the victory feel somewhat unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (solving a cold case) is clear but escalation remains flat—Elena methodically eliminates possibilities without encountering meaningful resistance or complication. No on-page reversal occurs; the investigation proceeds linearly from clue to analysis to solution. The cost of justice delayed is declared but not dramatized through present-scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal (honoring ancestor) to global (reversing atmospheric chaos), but this escalation happens through exposition rather than dramatized pressure. No meaningful obstacles impede Eli's progress - the panel simply "responded with a soft chime." The dominant stake shifts without testing Eli's commitment through concrete opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias witnessing and understanding the hitchhiker's transformation—lacks escalating pressure since events unfold through passive observation rather than active choice. No meaningful obstacles complicate his journey; the scaffold wrap simply embraces him and lifts him up. The transformation happens to him rather than through earned agency, with no visible cost or trade-off beyond leaving the physical world.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias redefining his legacy separate from his father—is signaled early but develops through reflection more than escalating pressure. Marcus's takeover attempt provides minimal complication; their confrontation lacks genuine tension or cost. The startup's failure happens in summary ("As startup unwound over subsequent months") rather than through dramatized beats. No meaningful tightening occurs under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract—"healing wisdom lost to humanity" never faces concrete test. The conflict resolves through convenient alignment of stars and collaboration without meaningful resistance or cost. No live option is foreclosed; Elara gains knowledge without losing anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are established (freeing the mentor) and the expanding circles create escalating revelation, but tension deflates when each discovery comes without resistance or cost. The druid's "warlike serenity never wavered" explicitly prevents genuine conflict. The flesh-eating plant requiring blood provides the only moment of sacrifice, but even this passes without struggle or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (restoring the eclipsed covenant) is declared early but never faces concrete opposition or cost.

No tightening occurs—the visionary simply performs prescribed actions until achieving their goal without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (mending escaped memories) is signaled early and tested when the memory "fought, desperate to remain free." However, escalation is minimal—the memory's resistance resolves quickly without forcing meaningful trade-offs or narrowing Elara's options beyond her established method.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Marcus recovering from professional and personal loss—is clear, and tension builds as he examines the cloth. The moment of recognition ("The '72 Leeds festival") provides a genuine turn. However, escalation remains largely internal without external pressure, and the foreman's arrival feels perfunctory rather than raising stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—finding and understanding the magnetic arbor—is signaled early but never faces concrete pressure or test on the page. Elara packs her bags and boards a vessel, but no meaningful tightening occurs; she faces no opposition, makes no difficult choice, pays no price. The spirit's departure creates opportunity rather than conflict, and her journey remains frictionless preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict or escalating stakes exist. The librarian performs their monthly ritual without opposition, complication, or meaningful choice. The "contradiction of being both librarian and library" is stated but never tested through action. The story describes a maintenance routine rather than dramatizing pressure that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—humanity's isolation driving them underground—is signaled early and develops through the inspector's discovery and transformation. The "heartbeat of hesitation" before understanding creates a minor tightening, but the transformation lacks meaningful resistance or cost. She accepts the crown and mission without struggle, and the "walls between hearts" resolution arrives without earned friction.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is signaled early and deepens through the graffiti discoveries leading to the hidden river. Elena's agency drives the exploration, and the cost is visible in her tears and emotional release. However, the conflict lacks significant resistance or complication - the path from graffiti to river to acceptance feels somewhat predetermined without meaningful obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake (accessing the library) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The quest proceeds smoothly: cipher leads to forest, watch opens library, protagonist reads and leaves unscathed. No meaningful tightening occurs—the watch's "urgent vibrating" creates false urgency without consequence when ignored.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    The empire's arrival creates clear temporal pressure, and Elara's choice to propagate rather than hide represents meaningful agency. The cost is visible—sacrificing the original violin to preserve its essence. However, the opposition remains off-page, and the stakes could be more viscerally tested through direct confrontation or harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving souls before oblivion claims them—is established early but faces no meaningful opposition or escalation. The ritual proceeds smoothly from beginning to end without complication, reversal, or tightening pressure that would force Elara to make trade-offs or confront limits.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake of finding "true peace" beyond forgiveness is declared but never tested through concrete pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs—Elara's journey proceeds without obstacles, reversals, or moments where she must choose between competing goods. The resolution arrives without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether professional detachment protects or imprisons—emerges too late and lacks sufficient pressure. The fisherman's dilemma provides external conflict but doesn't meaningfully test Elian. Under the accumulative lens, the story needs stronger density increase or pattern disruption; instead, it maintains steady texture without meaningful escalation until the brief final vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes center on Maya mastering the paradox of vanishing to appear, with tension building through her blindfolded trust and Elien's careful withholding. The revelation moment when she removes the blindfold provides a meaningful turn, though the conflict remains primarily pedagogical without genuine opposition or risk of failure until the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - Kael simply follows birds to a depression, places the arrowhead, and transforms without facing opposition or making trade-offs. The story declares high stakes ("centuries-long quest") but never tests them through concrete pressure. The resolution arrives through passive reception rather than earned agency, with no visible price paid for the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central conflict between standardized and authentic magic is established early and maintains coherence throughout. The act of removing the regulation pack represents a meaningful choice with clear stakes—rejecting the safety of automated magic for raw possibility. However, the journey lacks concrete obstacles or reversals, and Elias faces no real opposition or cost beyond the abstract weight of his equipment.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity about his synesthesia to a commitment to help others, with the key's transformation and portal crossing as meaningful tightening points. The cost manifests in the permanent mark and vow, though the middle section could develop more resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake - humanity's survival versus witnessing universal death - is signaled early. Pressure builds through the universe's accelerating contraction and Korin's doubt. However, the resolution through coin interpretation feels somewhat arbitrary; the spiral pattern's meaning isn't earned through prior setup, weakening the causal chain at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes center on transforming grief through naming, with clear escalation from personal pain ("Solitude") to cosmic understanding ("Lost Hope," "Elara's Eyes"). The naming acts progressively deepen, moving from internal ache to external monsters to celestial bodies. Cost is legible in the centuries of carried pain and the sacrifice of letting go, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal inadequacy through cosmic imbalance to successful restoration. The pressure builds through the mage's obsessive focus on dripping rates and the weight of "impossible" odds. However, the resolution lacks significant trade-offs—the mage gains everything (restored bell, warmed powers, saved ecosystem) without meaningful sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to maintain the official narrative or expose the truth—emerges clearly and tightens when Thomas discovers his aunt's activism. Escalation occurs through accumulating evidence (label→journals→photographs→aunt's identity), narrowing his options toward confrontation. The cost is primarily professional risk, though more concrete opposition would strengthen the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or escalation; Elara performs her ritual and succeeds without complications, reversals, or trade-offs. The starlings arrive "as if summoned," the crystal transforms perfectly, and she achieves her goal without visible price or foreclosed options, creating a tension-free progression that lacks the pressure needed for stakes to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain declared rather than dramatized - "catastrophic consequences of failure" and "determine everyone's fate" never manifest in specific pressure. The emergency protocol creates momentary tension but leads to no on-page choice or trade-off. Under the accumulative lens, density increases but never forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.8)
    The temporal pressure of history rewriting creates urgency, and Maya's internal conflict between numbness and the need to feel provides stakes. Yet the escalation remains largely conceptual—the "trembling" dojo and "glowing jar" signal change without showing concrete consequences or forcing harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.8)
    No genuine conflict emerges—receiving and planting a mysterious seed creates curiosity but no stakes. The story declares Elara must "safeguard space for innovation" but never tests this against opposition. No escalation occurs; the narrative maintains the same contemplative register throughout without pressure that would force choice or reveal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (restoring lost laughter/processing grief) is signaled early but escalation is minimal—Silas modulates the blower, creates sound, hears giggle, accepts absence. The giggle provides a deepening moment but no meaningful tightening of options. Cost remains abstract ("momentarily soothed") rather than dramatized through concrete loss or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes center on the guardian's dimensional homesickness and centuries of waiting, with escalation through the pendant's warming and garden's transformation.

However, the conflict lacks opposition - everything aligns to enable transformation without meaningful resistance or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clear—breaking the family's stifling destiny through transformation rather than preservation. The three attempts create escalation through successive approximation. However, there's no real opposition or complication; each attempt simply gets closer to success without meaningful setbacks or trade-offs that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (tuning the fragment to lunar frequencies) is signaled early but escalation remains shallow—Elara progresses smoothly from attempt to success without meaningful reversal or tightening pressure. The "frustration" of previous interpreters is told rather than dramatized through concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (merging fractured timelines) is clear, and pressure builds through the ferry's transformation and arrival at the grotto. Yet escalation feels predetermined rather than contested—no meaningful obstacles arise, no trade-offs force difficult choices, and the merger succeeds without visible struggle or price beyond Liam's final transient state.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with his sister—is clear from the fourth paragraph. Escalation occurs through the threads moving independently and emotions erupting as phantom figures, narrowing Elias's options to direct contact. However, the resolution lacks genuine struggle; the sister appears without earned difficulty, reducing the cost's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on Kael's need to prove edge geometry works, with escalation through weeks of calculation leading to validation. The breakthrough when returning ships confirm his coordinates provides meaningful tightening. Cost registers conceptually as the city's paradigm shift, though personal sacrifice remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes escalate from routine contact tracing to child endangerment with clear tightening when Elena recognizes the predator pattern. The hearing aid's increasing urgency drives action forward. Cost is legible in Elena's shift from providing closure to preventing tragedy, though the resolution via security feels slightly deflated.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—guiding trapped souls through transitions—intensifies as Elara works against the tidal clock. Seven shadows guided shows agency through action, though individual transitions lack differentiation. The tide's return forcing her emergence provides concrete cost, but escalation plateaus rather than builds through the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—the narrator seeks "wisdom from failure" but faces no concrete opposition or meaningful choice under pressure. The ink ritual provides texture but no escalation; the revelation about the defense mechanism arrives without struggle or cost that would foreclose options.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake (preserving the dying language) is clear from the start, but escalation is minimal—the story maintains steady pressure without meaningful tightening until the birds' new pattern. The breakthrough feels convenient rather than earned through accumulated struggle. No concrete obstacles or setbacks test the storyteller's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain static—Aris observes and documents without facing escalating pressure or meaningful choices. The dominant stake (revealing wonders vs maintaining secrecy) never faces a concrete test. No tightening occurs; Aris continues observing without cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (reawakening beauty in a mechanical world) is clear from the start and escalates through the dangerous orchard infiltration. The living statues provide tangible opposition, and Elayn's theft carries visible cost (the orchard's sigh, pursuit by guardians). However, the resolution feels somewhat easy—the world transforms without significant resistance or sacrifice beyond the initial theft.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly when guards enter mid-exchange, forcing Elias to maintain cover while the woman disappears with the bottle. His calculated remark about "momentous weather" shows agency under pressure. The cost is clear: risking his position and freedom to deliver hope, with the final revelation that he plans to reunite mother and daughter raising stakes retroactively.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—interpreting silence as possibility—progresses from craftsmanship through magical discovery to vocal expression, with the halo fragment discovery creating genuine pressure. However, escalation relies heavily on magical convenience rather than character agency, and while the singing represents a meaningful choice after twenty years, the immediate cost of breaking silence lacks concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (reawakening dormant stories) signals early and builds through the hyperbolic arrangement, though escalation remains gentle rather than pressured. The moment when "stories took physical form as shimmering threads" represents the single meaningful deepening, but lacks opposing force or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through the discovery of "The Language of Light and Longing" and the subsequent revelation of the map, narrowing Elara's search from years of fruitless attempts to a specific location. The cost manifests as seven years of searching and the bittersweet realization that connection requires accepting transformation rather than recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—freeing a revolutionary idea from fear—is signaled early through the hair lock and mission description. Escalation occurs through the ritual's intensification (walking circles, falling backward into consciousness, entering the mental chamber) culminating in the woman's choice to touch the starlit thread. The cost appears in her recognition that "ideas grow heavier when contained" and the final transformation, though agency primarily rests with Silas rather than building mutual pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is clear from paragraph 2. Escalation occurs through the pattern discovery (constellation matching mushroom ring) but lacks intermediate pressure points. The resolution arrives through observation rather than costly choice, and the "memory thieves as preservers" revelation deflates rather than heightens the conflict's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from the archivist's trembling examination of a stubborn shard through Prisha's nervous arrival to her final steady-handed annotation work. The cost of exile remains palpable throughout. However, the central conflict could benefit from more immediate pressure—the teaching moment feels somewhat controlled rather than truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("preserve the color of wonder") without concrete opposition or meaningful escalation. The transformation proceeds smoothly without reversals or complications - no moment where failure seems possible. Cost is declared ("give pieces of oneself") but not dramatized through visible struggle or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—grounding restless spirits to achieve peace—escalates through Elena's physical unraveling of the net, with each knot releasing trapped memories that she must absorb into her attribute. The cost is legible as she becomes "a conduit" taking on others' suffering. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as layers of silence and released whispers build toward the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on recovering lost knowledge, with tension building through the methodical uncovering of patterns across decades of footage.

The broken gondola string creates a situation but no escalating conflict that would validate or challenge her theories through action.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal artistic project to discovering centuries-old wisdom that transforms her practice, with demolition as temporal pressure. The tightening occurs when the coin's patterns align with her compensatory perception methods. Cost is legible but somewhat external (building destruction) rather than arising from protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (making a great discovery) is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. The pattern-solving proceeds linearly without setback, false lead, or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear - learning the rhythm of repair - with one meaningful deepening when Elias discovers he must restore rather than claim. Under accumulative lens, pressure builds through repetition and environment. However, the revelation feels slightly predetermined rather than hard-won through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.4)
    The soil depletion creates genuine stakes, and Elion's challenge of communicating through his noncorporeal state adds tension. The discovery of the watering bell provides one meaningful turn. Yet escalation remains gentle—the solution arrives through following instructions rather than wrestling with trade-offs, and the "miracle" unfolds without visible cost or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear: prevent oblivion by weaving the lullaby through the clock's mechanism. The escalation through "stuttering rhythm" and "starlight threads dimmed" creates genuine pressure. However, the resolution feels slightly predetermined—once Elias begins, success seems assured rather than genuinely contested.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (saving travelers before frost forms) creates urgency and escalates through the ticking clock. However, resolution comes too easily - Elias faces no meaningful obstacles using his ability, the mechanical birds don't detect him, and the travelers follow without complication. The cost of spending the nut's power is mentioned but not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling professional success with personal isolation—is signaled early and deepens through the ravine descent. The moment of tracing foam patterns creates a meaningful tightening where scientific and personal understanding converge. The cost of her chosen path ("how often had she felt like that hollow shell") is palpable, though the resolution comes somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure builds through the accumulation of the vendor's careful preparations, from adjusting moonlight displays through selecting memory shards to the door-creation ceremony. The parole's nightly renewal requirement and the library's selective accessibility create persistent constraints. The escalation from solitary preparation to customer arrival provides one meaningful deepening, though the internal stakes could tighten more dramatically.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake of transforming painful memories is signaled early, but escalation remains flat—Kael encounters the stored remorse and works with it exactly as planned without meaningful complication or tightening pressure.

The resolution arrives through steady application of his established technique rather than through choice under increasing constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.6)
    The central conflict between farmers and townspeople exists primarily in summary rather than dramatized opposition. No meaningful escalation occurs - Elena's plan succeeds through four meetings without substantive resistance or complication. The stakes remain abstract (community division) without concrete costs or trade-offs that would force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from device modification through neural activation to permanent consciousness transformation, with cost visible in identity blurring and tears. The "quaking reverie" intensifies appropriately. However, the transformation lacks concrete opposition or struggle beyond internal acceptance, missing the resistance that would heighten the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—activating ancient defenses against approaching darkness—is signaled early and the sixty-minute constraint adds pressure. However, escalation remains mechanical as Elara solves puzzles without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs. The "latent blaze" growing stronger lacks concrete manifestation that would alter her tactics or capabilities.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (restoring music) is clear but faces no meaningful opposition or complication. Elara's process unfolds without obstacles or reversals. While the discovered emotions create texture, they don't force choices or narrow options - the work simply proceeds as intended.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through the three-day countdown and intensifying magnetic pulses, with Elias's exhaustion and wavering motivation creating genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake of unlocking the diary to understand empathy is signaled early, with escalation through the building frequencies creating a "crescendo." However, no meaningful obstacles or reversals test Elara's commitment—the diary simply opens when she achieves the right combination—and the cost remains abstract without showing what fifteen years of isolated study has actually cost her.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, the story builds pressure through Elara's dedication and climbing, but escalation remains gentle. The seed's pulsing and eventual opening provide textural intensification, yet no genuine obstacles or costs emerge. The "critical insight" arrives without struggle—the seed simply opens and reveals itself. Missing is the resistance or trade-off that would create meaningful tension.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    The gravitational inversion creates coherent pressure and Arion's navigation choices show agency. However, escalation plateaus after the inversion begins - the discovery feels convenient rather than hard-won, lacking a meaningful tightening that forecloses options or forces trade-offs with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.8)
    While atmospheric pressure accumulates through the investigation, there's no meaningful tightening that forecloses options or forces trade-offs. Elena methodically documents without facing escalating obstacles or costs - the "singular convergence" discovery doesn't alter her tactics or require sacrifice, merely confirms anomalies.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—proving wonder's necessity—faces minimal opposition beyond Eira's sense of responsibility. Escalation occurs through accumulating sensory layers rather than rising obstacles. The "sculpted hush" creates meaningful deepening, but lacks concrete antagonistic pressure or genuine risk of failure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.6)
    Escalation occurs through deepening revelation as each melody unveils new understanding, culminating in tears that wash away guilt. The cost is primarily internal/emotional rather than external, appropriate for this accumulative design but lacking a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding emotion through invasive empathy—escalates through Thomas's disorientation and panic as his personality is borrowed and returned. The transfer creates visible cost through his fractured calm and flight. However, the resolution lacks full agency as Thomas becomes passive subject rather than active participant in the conflict's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—delivering the pendant before solstice to germinate the village seeds—provides clear pressure. Escalation occurs through accumulated encounters (elderly traveler, earth response, village arrival) that deepen understanding of the pendant's power. The cost manifests in Ayla's hollow feeling after relinquishing the artifact, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) is clear but faces no meaningful opposition or escalation. Elara presses prism to glass, sees visions, and accepts expanded understanding without struggle, reversal, or price paid. The "timeframe when assumptions shatter" creates expectation but delivers revelation without earned pressure or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: each vanishing sound raises urgency, the bead's dimming creates a ticking clock, and each puzzle step demands increasing sacrifice. The pattern deepens meaningfully when "minutes, sometimes years seemed to pass" between pieces. Cost is legible in the sacrificed memories and the bead's complete depletion.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming from overlooked craftsman to essential community member—escalates through the silk bargain and culminates in repairing the arch supports.

However, the resolution feels too frictionless; Orion succeeds without meaningful struggle or setback after gaining his powers.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.6)
    Escalation occurs through deepening perception—from initial trembling to reality fraying to expanded consciousness—with the red shard introducing complication and the mysterious door crystallizing choice. The dominant stake (discovering truth about fragmented identity) tightens adequately, though the cost of failure never becomes tangible beyond abstract determination.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes build through the lamp failure creating urgency for discovery, with the revelation of the keeper tradition deepening meaning. The conflict between isolation and connection drives the narrative. However, there's no real opposition or cost to Elias joining the chain—the resolution comes too easily without forcing a genuine trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract - "helping humanity rediscover itself" never faces concrete opposition. The twin comet prediction creates momentary tension but resolves without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding what trees witness—is signaled early but lacks escalating pressure. The pin drop provides a single tightening moment that triggers revelation, but Samuel faces no genuine opposition or difficult trade-offs. The resolution arrives through passive reception rather than costly choice, with the moonlight healing removing even the physical stakes of his raw hands.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are clear (rekindling the dying realm) but escalation relies on accumulation of the same action (swaddling more saplings) rather than deepening pressure. The "urgency quickening their steps" is declared rather than arising from new complications.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.3)
    The central conflict—attending versus avoiding the gathering—lacks escalation under any lens. Eleanor's decision crystallizes without meaningful tightening or opposition beyond her own static contemplation. No external pressure tests her choice; the arriving member accepts her note without friction.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=5.8)
    Escalation occurs through accumulation—from noticing decay to finding the tea house to discovering letters to revealing truth—but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes (preserving luminous vows) are declared early but remain abstract - we never see what happens if they fade completely. The "discovery" of preservation possibility lacks earned escalation; it simply appears from routine measurement without building pressure or forcing difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate through Eliza's three attempts—from the failed approach to the burly pirate, through planting suspicion with the second-in-command, to the final calculated lie about patrol schedules. The truce breaking carries immediate consequence (first shot fired), though Eliza's personal risk remains somewhat abstract beyond achieving her strange goal.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding and accepting one's role as a weather carrier—escalates through sensory accumulation and the storm man's arrival. The transformation carries cost (losing skepticism, accepting responsibility), though the forest elections subplot dilutes focus slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of reclaiming suppressed creativity is signaled early but escalation occurs through internal summary ("determination replacing sorrow") rather than dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal record-keeping to finding the Repository through the map discovery, with Elara's wilting creating genuine cost for pursuing truth. The dominant stake (finding lost conversations) tightens when map and postal fragment align. However, no on-page test of these stakes occurs—all risk remains anticipatory.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder through visual communication—is signaled early but escalation remains flat. Elara faces no meaningful opposition or reversal; the sculpture works immediately and perfectly. The seasonal muteness provides mild constraint but doesn't force trade-offs. Her death brings change but without prior pressure building toward it—the conflict lacks the tightening that would make this resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through magnetic shift → dome failure → roses wilting → forced miniaturization choice. The android's agency drives the resolution through "controlled burn escape," with clear cost in sacrificing its unified form. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as environmental and internal crises compound to force transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering Eliza's story to heal community bonds—develops through accumulating neighborhood stories that deepen understanding. Pressure builds as demolition notices threaten the historic district, creating urgency for preserving collective memory. The resolution shows Leo's agency in choosing communal healing over individual ownership, though the escalation relies more on information accumulation than active opposition or difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—liberating the laboratory's knowledge—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. Elara's progress unfolds without reversals or meaningful obstacles; the dance sequences succeed too easily. No visible cost or trade-off emerges when she achieves her goal, reducing tension to mere procedure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding where deleted memories go—intensifies through Elara's methodical investigation leading to physical excavation. The gravity pocket's resistance ("as if the gravity pocket was fighting her intrusion") provides concrete opposition. The discovery of the crystal archive represents a meaningful deepening that transforms her understanding, though the story could benefit from higher immediate cost during the digging sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (hushing the prophecy) is signaled early but never tested—no obstacles arise, no choices require trade-offs, and the ritual proceeds without complication. The story lacks escalation under any lens; it's essentially a successful procedure without opposition or meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of understanding architectural language progresses through teaching sessions to revelation, but lacks meaningful pressure or opposition. The "interrogation" feels gentle rather than pressured, and no live options are foreclosed with visible cost until the passive inheritance at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal mystery to bearing dangerous family knowledge, with cost visible in "the burden of containing what others could not bear to see." The pressure builds through crystal activation and memory surfacing, though agency feels somewhat passive—memories arrive rather than being wrestled from quarantine.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—redemption for past betrayal—is clear from the start, with the key discovery creating a tightening that enables resolution. The blood signature represents genuine cost, though escalation remains mostly internal without external pressure or complication beyond Elias's own guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (maintaining balance between echoes and silence) shifts when the child's powerful echo threatens the nexus, but escalation remains abstract. The singer's choice between duty and curiosity lacks concrete pressure - no time constraint, no competing forces acting simultaneously, just sequential discovery through the seashell's revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (exposing truth about the shipwreck) develops through discovery rather than escalating pressure. Elara faces no opposition or meaningful obstacles—she finds the globe easily, connects with spirits smoothly, and delivers truth without resistance. The story tells us about "weaving truth carefully" but shows no actual difficulty or trade-offs in this process.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in hidden patterns—remains static throughout without meaningful tightening or deepening that would alter options. While the protagonist's philosophy evolves "slowly, like moss," no on-page pressure forces him to choose between competing values or face consequences for his solitary practice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes escalate from investigating an anomaly to uncovering a corporate conspiracy about dimensional energy, but Maya faces no concrete opposition or immediate pressure forcing her choice. The "radioactive dust storm" arrives but doesn't test her commitment or exact a price.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout - Elias interprets messages and watches a prophet rise, but faces no concrete opposition or meaningful choice that would test his "variant allegiance." The conflict exists entirely in summary (dismissed by authorities) rather than dramatized scene. No escalation occurs; the ending simply confirms his interpretations were correct.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—bridging generational disconnect—emerges clearly and tightens when the poet infuses his own "understanding of emotional resonance" into the capture. The transformation at the senior center shows meaningful deepening, though agency feels slightly passive as the music does most of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (protect artifact) is clear and pressure escalates through approaching intruders, but agency feels limited - Elias simply performs a predetermined ritual without meaningful choice or trade-off. The intruders scream and flee without offering genuine resistance or forcing adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring natural patience to a hasty community—never faces concrete opposition or test. The mapper observes, charts, and plans without encountering resistance, doubt, or complication. When the moon reaches zenith and the viaduct hums, this merely confirms existing theories rather than forcing a choice under pressure. The "revolution" remains entirely theoretical, with no dramatized conflict between the mapper's vision and any opposing force.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from routine investigation to systemic corruption exposure, with Maya's personal liberation arc paralleling the case. The pressure coheres around the lantern discovery and document revelation, though the middle section lacks a decisive tightening moment before the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—whether to repair the heart or redirect resources toward restitution—emerges clearly and tightens when Father Michael reveals he's already bought the house. The cost is explicit in spending his "entire savings" and the emotional weight of carrying Grant's message. However, Eleanor's presence doesn't create active opposition, limiting the pressure to internal deliberation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (finding and ringing the bell) is clear but faces no meaningful opposition. The journey proceeds without reversals or genuine obstacles - even the "hidden chamber" opens readily to the glider's approach.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes escalate from routine cataloging to uncovering a conspiracy, with the ninety-second access window creating genuine pressure, but the resolution relies on convenient success - Elara downloads "everything she could" without facing real opposition or paying a price. The dominant stake of uncovering truth tightens but lacks a decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on saving the settlement from "the coming storm" with escalation through Elena's three mirror visits building to the reconstitution. The elders' skepticism provides opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (Elena's decision about ending her life) is clear, but escalation under the accumulative lens is weak—density increases through metaphor and reflection without meaningful pressure points that narrow options. Marcus's gentle wisdom and Elena's internal realizations don't create the coherent pressure or pattern break that would force stance crystallization. The cost exists (giving up her planned death) but arrives through contemplation rather than accumulated external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=2.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under any lens—the protagonist cycles through identical reflections about relationships and connection without tightening options or forcing trade-offs. The dominant stake (finding meaning in loneliness) never faces concrete tests or opposition. Each paragraph restates the same realizations about "destined mismatches" and "intersubjective understanding" without deepening knowledge or narrowing paths.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the ritual proceeds from intention to completion without resistance or complication. Stakes remain abstract ("preserving wisdom's echo") without concrete consequences for failure. The story declares urgency ("after the prophet departs, only echoes will remain") but this deadline never pressures the action or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.9)
    No meaningful conflict or escalation exists - the gathering unfolds without opposition, complication, or resistance. Stakes remain abstract ("survivors of a recent tragedy") without specifics that would create pressure. The story describes healing happening but shows no struggle, cost, or trade-off in achieving it.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the scholar simply continues his established work pattern throughout. The "revelation" about translation versus preservation doesn't emerge from pressure or force any trade-off. The story declares high stakes ("linguistic extinction") but never tests them through concrete opposition or tightening constraints that would force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from abstract searching to concrete discovery when the chalk drawing activates the arch's captured echoes. The prophet's choice to complete the pattern despite knowing he'll forget shows agency with cost. However, the caretaker's convenient appearance and departure weakens the earned quality of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on understanding the tremors threatening the observatory, with pressure building through days of attempts. The resolution through "resonance not force" provides meaningful deepening, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral - "luminous ache" doesn't fully land as felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on executing "a flawless goodbye" through music and the vinyl fragment. Escalation occurs through the son's kneeling and false hope ("when you're feeling better"), forcing acceptance. The cost lands in the son clutching the fragment "as if it's a holy relic." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though pressure could intensify more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (discovering where shadows go) is signaled early but escalation is purely mechanical—connecting rune stones in sequence without meaningful opposition or cost. No genuine reversal or tightening occurs; each loop completion brings automatic progress. The resolution arrives through procedural completion rather than earned agency facing resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on Eleanor's need to understand Arthur's transformation and potentially rescue him, with escalation through the bone-setting ritual that bridges realms. The tooth's vibration and the garden's edge-blurring create one meaningful tightening. However, the conflict lacks urgency—Eleanor faces no opposing force or time pressure, and the resolution comes too easily through mutual recognition without genuine cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (sharing celestial wonder despite being earthbound) is clear and the pressure deepens when Elara discovers the sea glass creates patterns "unlike anything she had ever seen through her telescope." However, the escalation lacks a decisive tightening moment - the discovery feels convenient rather than hard-won against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening as the protagonist moves from passive observation to active offering, with the pendant placement marking the decisive turn. The "protected vulnerability" intensifies from defensive walking to extended hands in offering. Cost is visible in surrendering the ancestral pendant, though the conflict could benefit from more immediate resistance before acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain entirely internal and abstract—the conflict between artistic integrity and commercial pressure never manifests in concrete scene pressure. No meaningful escalation occurs; the novelist's contemplation maintains steady emotional temperature throughout. The resolution arrives without earned struggle or visible cost, as his "unexpected peace" emerges from reflection rather than dramatized choice or renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate appropriately from personal discovery to communal restoration, with the harvest moon deadline providing temporal pressure. The dominant stake (cultural memory loss) signals early and resolves through Elara's agency. Yet the conflict lacks meaningful opposition or complication - everything proceeds too smoothly from problem identification to resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—creating maps to guide humanity through darkness—is declared but never tested through genuine pressure. "One misstep... and the starlight would dissipate" tells us about risk without dramatizing it. The alchemist works "undisturbed by the weight of expectation" which deflates rather than builds tension.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on preserving generational memory against forgetting, with Elara's weeks-long effort showing commitment and cost. The pressure builds through accumulation of "small revelations" rather than reversals, fitting the textural lens. However, no meaningful opposition tests her progress—the work proceeds smoothly from understanding to completion without setback or complication that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—collecting and transforming burdens—progresses through fourteen calcifications with varying weights (king's unexpectedly light, farmer's heavier). The ancient civilization's burden provides the story's tightening moment. However, escalation remains flat; each burden calcifies similarly without building pressure or forcing harder choices, and the weaver's own burden doesn't meaningfully complicate the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on Clara's need to transform grief into creation, with the kettle's boiling time creating natural pressure. The carving progresses from tentative to confident cuts, showing agency through artistic choice. Cost is visible in the "specific shape" of absence becoming presence. Limited by lack of external complication or meaningful reversal, appropriate for accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from searching for the camera wheel to confronting the ghost, with the carousel's restart as meaningful deepening. The camera wheel's transformation into a bridge of words provides clear tightening of options. Cost is visible when the wheel dissolves, though the ghost's quick acceptance reduces tension slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake of "resurrecting hope through the terminal" is signaled but never tested - Maya faces no meaningful opposition or setback. She works "for hours" but experiences no fatigue, doubt, or technical failure that would create genuine escalation or force a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with abandoned dreams—is clear from the opening. The story achieves one meaningful deepening as the crystals' song triggers Elias's realization about his lost "temporal clock" dream. However, the bear's presence doesn't escalate pressure; it merely witnesses without adding genuine conflict or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful conflict or escalation exists—Elara wants to find truth, searches for it, and finds it without opposition or complication. The journal discovery happens exactly as intended with no reversal, tightening, or cost. Stakes remain abstract ("architecture of lies") without concrete pressure or trade-offs that would force a difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on preserving dying knowledge, with pressure building through the collector's patient observation and the fisherman's gradual trust. The dominant stake signals early and tightens when the fisherman reveals the knots' significance. However, the conflict lacks a sharp moment where options genuinely narrow with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether the traveler can move beyond chronicling others' emotional deaths to confronting his own—is signaled early and deepens through accumulation. However, escalation occurs primarily through internal reflection rather than external pressure, with no meaningful obstacles or reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear: accessing the locked dimension to reunite with humanity's consciousness. Escalation is driven by Eli's agency under the Accumulative lens, through the precise, high-risk act of stitching. The cost of potential failure (trapping in the void) and success (dissolution) is legible and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake (understanding transformation) escalates through a cadence shift when Ian meets the villager, reweighting his goal under the Accumulative lens. The cost is felt in his realization that he must become an agent of change, not an observer. Protagonist agency drives the escalation through his decision to follow the impulse and later release the bug.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonists' agency in exploiting the planned blackout. The dominant stake (sparking revolution) tightens through the act of completing the coded message. The cost—the ever-present danger of their clandestine actions—is legible and coherent under the textural lens, though the external pressure from the "oppressive rulers" remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens, as each placed stone intensifies the pattern and the star dust's pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation is driven by the storm and timer under the Accumulative lens, tightening the stakes of her vigil. Cost is felt in her decision to write and descend, though the dominant stake (publishing poetry) remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (decoding the overture) is clear and escalates under the Accumulative lens through a cadence shift—the shift from solitary decoding to intellectual combat with the student. This deepening changes his knowledge and options, foreclosing his isolation and opening a mentorship path. The cost is the time and focused energy spent, which is legible on the page and alters his immediate tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation under accumulative lens occurs through density increase (seeds, memories, actions) that reweights the stake of preserving knowledge. Agency in rebuilding and scattering seeds narrows options with visible cost. Pressure coheres, though one tightening would suffice; the accumulation is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the causal lens: the clock's anomaly prompts research, which leads to the plan executed at the perfect moment. The dominant stake (defying time for his daughter) is signaled early and tightens with the approaching night and system shutdown. The cost—leaving his known life behind—is legible on the page. A minor deduction as the pressure from the failing systems is more stated than felt through immediate, on-page tactile consequences for him.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a single, meaningful cadence shift: the song triggering the awakening. The dominant stake (cultural memory) is signaled early and tested concretely. The cost is legible in the final image of the arriving monsoon, which forecloses the path and charges the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens—his confession ("I never told her...") triggers the compass's vigorous response, deepening the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are internal—refusing drama for humble attention—and escalation is mostly a steady accrual rather than a tightening. There’s no strong on‑page foreclosing choice under pressure, only a consolidation of stance. The colleagues’ disapproval is gestured at but doesn’t create a live squeeze. The final image deepens rather than narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are personal survival and exposure of a conspiracy, signaled early. Escalation comes via the deciphering beat (spiral → industrialist → minerals), narrowing options into action. Pressure is mostly internal and investigative; no palpable on‑page risk tests the resolve, so cost feels abstract. The tightening is real but calm.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear—rectify silence by composing visible music—but escalation is gentle; observation leads to success without a narrowing choice or trade‑off. No meaningful reversal or on‑page cost tests her commitment. The cadence intensifies atmospherically rather than through pressured decision. As a result, tension remains low despite the conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (transforming distress into sanctuary/purpose) is signaled early and resolves, but pressure escalates gently rather than through hard turns. Warnings from locals and deep‑sea descent promise risk yet never bite; assembly succeeds without setback. The meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes the pedestal’s purpose and commits to restoration. Clear, but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes—community survival and cohesion—are established early and deepened by escalating sanctions. The meaningful tightening arrives via the news of added sanctions and the choice to expand aid region‑wide. Yet on‑page opposition stays abstract, with no immediate obstacle or loss to dramatize the price. The resolution is agency‑driven but light on concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is internal healing; escalation arrives through the projection sharpening with breath and the warming/dissolving tear. Pressure deepens rather than reverses; there’s no explicit external opposition, but cadence intensifies to a realization. Cost is mostly emotional release and renunciation of capture (“some revelations were meant to be felt”). Stakes are clear yet gentle, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: understanding time versus dissolution of self. Pressure escalates credibly from curiosity to compulsion to bodily risk; the return of the fragment and the activation are meaningful tightenings. The cost is unmistakable at the end. A mid‑scene concrete obstacle could have intensified stakes even more.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates once with the early arrival of the crew, narrowing options. The cost—sacrificing the remaining vault seeds—is present but mostly conceptual. Obstacles resolve quickly (decoding and escape), so tension doesn’t fully tighten into a wrenching trade‑off. Agency drives the outcome but without a bruising price.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: capture and understand betrayal’s sound before time/emotional margin runs out. Escalation is a subtle deepening—capture, imprint, cooling, then the sound’s unexpected shift—more tonal than adversarial but effective for the chosen lens. The renunciation of commercialization introduces a felt price. Still, external pressure is low, making the turn less sharp than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (obtain jar to unlock a pattern) is clear, but pressure is soft: the stationmaster barely complicates the theft and the lift takes “three breathless seconds.” The meaningful tightening occurs post‑heist when the workshop sequence reweights options. The on‑page price paid feels low; no foreclosed option is palpably costly in scene. Tension operates more through tone than resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on whether he can transform abandonment into sanctuary; escalation is modest: heat, shaping, mounting on reclaimed copper, then placement in light. There’s a single meaningful tightening when he commits to finishing and giving the piece a functional base. The price is mostly internal and implied rather than tested under acute pressure. Tension operates more in texture than in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (evade The Production to reach truth/mother), and pressure tightens via the midnight clock and approaching footsteps. The internal and external conflicts braid effectively, but escalation remains largely declarative—no concrete loss or foreclosed path beyond choosing to stand and reveal. The cost is felt yet not materially cashed; still, the charged poise is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular: how to face the coming endless night. Escalation is a density increase (star flicker → vanishing) and a stance shift (prevent vs. guide), not a reversal; it still narrows options with a felt conceptual price. The pebbles and booklet focus her agency on mapping absence, which redefines tactics. The pressure remains coherent but is more meditative than testing, keeping tension strong but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (seek origin of thought vs obey protocol/safety) tightens as the robot chooses touch, then play, then surrender. The escalation is a decisive deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate to length and lens. The price—loss of external directives and dissolution risk—reads on the page, if more conceptual than visceral. Tension is steady and crescendos at the integration.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—transparency vs. privacy—tightens when the lens reveals private lives and the map leads below. The key turn is Elara choosing restraint; however, opposition remains abstract, and the price of refusing power isn’t sharply felt in scene. Escalation is more conceptual than pressured. The community thaw arrives smoothly, lowering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (defend the garden’s unquantifiable bond), but pressure barely tightens; the scientists’ visit functions as a looming backdrop rather than an on‑page test. The cereus bloom provides a small victory, commemorated, not contested. The closing act is a stance rather than a forced trade‑off, with cost largely conceptual. Tension operates more as atmosphere than as narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.6)
    Pressure is low: each lever works as intended, no complication tests resolve or forces trade‑offs. The dominant stake (prove sideways time) never faces a live counterforce; risk remains abstract. The tightening from first to third lever is procedural, not costly, so escalation feels flat. The ending is a satisfied exhale rather than a charged turn.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (complete the lost aria to free or reach the ghost) is signaled early. The meaningful tightening is Elias’s decision to “disrupt the silence” and commit to playing; the apparition and dissolution deepen pressure rather than reverse it. Costs are primarily conceptual/emotional; concrete jeopardy is limited, keeping escalation gentle. Still, agency drives the climax cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear—locate and return the swallowed truth—and pressure tightens when the smudge yields coordinates and the subcutaneous map emerges. The move from investigation to geared departure is the key deepening. Costs feel more atmospheric than acute; we don’t see a live trade‑off beyond physical weakness and reverence for the illustration. Still, the internal and external threads reinforce each other credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (unearthing the swallowed truth) is clear, and pressure coheres through the confession and the vision surge. Escalation is modest and largely interpretive; Marcus isn’t forced into a hard trade-off or tangible loss. Agency operates as attention and interpretation rather than decision under cost. The result feels resonant but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—observer ethos versus the lure of stasis—is clear and tightens when the regenerative silence actively preserves and heals. The escalation is a single, meaningful deepening rather than multiple turns, appropriate to length. The refusal to remain functions as the decisive pressure point, though the on‑page price is more conceptual than visceral. Tension is sustained through image and cadence rather than overt antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake (Lila’s silence) intensifies as the eclipse approaches, with a clear tightening at the eerie twilight where drumming grows confident. Agency is present in Maya’s framing and pacing; the cost is the risk of breaking a fragile opening. Stakes remain intimate but coherent; no extraneous antagonism diffuses pressure. The resolution feels earned rather than lucky.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve stories before they fade) is clear but rarely faces concrete resistance; tension is conceptual more than situational. The primary tightening is the discovery of diaries linking tapestry to the displaced axis—an information deepening rather than a costful turn. The ending forecloses nothing new; it renews the same path. Stakes stay abstract, with little on-page price for choices.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake (nudging mass perception) is signaled, but pressure barely tightens. No on‑page reversal or enforced trade‑off occurs; the work proceeds smoothly to delivery. The prophetic and spycraft elements never force a dilemma or price. The final cadence is a continuation rather than an escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is explicit: free Sarah before integration completes. Escalation is coherent—entity reacts to frequencies, falters at the paradox, and loses grip when silence removes its noise‑food. Agency drives the turns, but the price paid is modest; no meaningful tradeoff or loss is registered. The pressure tightens once decisively and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around a live clock (dawn/exhaustion) and the internal quest to map memory into music. Escalation is a density build: memories intensify, the shell glows, vibrations rise, culminating in a crescendo followed by collapse. The cost—spent energy and the fleetingness of achievement—is legible. Stakes remain intimate but charged; there’s one meaningful tightening without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stakes (self-understanding under time pressure) are clear and tightened by the eclipse window and deepening visions. The central chamber functions as a meaningful intensification where options and identity converge. However, the legible price is light—no hard trade-off beyond internal acceptance—so pressure never fully bites. Escalation is coherent under the chosen lens but does not force a difficult renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defeating numbness—is clear and advances via a meaningful deepening when the reverse spin yields the “filament of hush.” Pressure escalates modestly through broader stakes (teaching students) but faces little counter‑pressure or risk. The felt price is subtle: endurance of deafness and vulnerability in public demonstration. A tighter on‑page test or friction would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (expose regime) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when Elias co-opts the inner circle pigeon. Pressure is coherent but largely internal; no on‑page counterforce intervenes at the peak, softening felt cost. Still, the decision forecloses safer paths (silence, delay) in a legible way. The “watchers retreated” clock works as a light squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are focused: whether he can face and reinterpret scent-triggered pain. Escalation is achieved through accumulating scent notes and the live clock to the orchid’s bloom, culminating in a renewed stance. The price is visible (tears, reweighing of memory), and the resolution arises from his endurance and choice to stop resisting grief. No antagonist is needed; pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (“how to live in altered time”) is stated, and escalation occurs via pattern complexity. Yet pressure never tightens to foreclose a path; “impossible choices” remain conceptual rather than tested. The mid‑scene tweak (“rearranged a section…change rippled”) hints at cost but doesn’t force a trade‑off. Resolution is contemplative rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is internal: whether Kael can find/forge music within silence. Pressure coheres via ritual into the decision to perform with the bowl, deepening meaning rather than narrowing options. The escalation is serene rather than strenuous, with limited visible price. Still, the performance crystallizes stance and reweights the field.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—successfully integrating the counterfeit emotion—remains largely unthreatened. The only tightening arrives when he must “subsume the last remnants,” but there’s no credible risk or pushback on the page. Resolution is assured, so tension plateaus despite competent process detail. The ethical and emotional stakes are asserted rather than stressed.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain low and largely untested: funding is “cut,” but Elias’s competence quickly solves it without visible trade‑offs or pushback. There’s no meaningful tightening or reversal; pressure does not escalate so much as glide. The closing cycle affirmation arrives without a price that narrows options. Conflict reads aspirational rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (belonging) are clear and escalate via the risky, collaborative search culminating in the sigil’s revaluation. The tightening is more epistemic than perilous; pressure rises but rarely bites with concrete loss. The final act (etching/dedication) is a credible stance crystallization. A sharper on‑page price would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (restore rhythm before the giant wakes) is explicit and the pressure meaningfully tightens as the nap ends. The key escalation—borrowing deeply from his future to shatter the cage—narrows options with a visible price. The giant’s stir and the lurch provide a live turn that tests commitment. Resolution is earned by agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are focused (understanding loss to potentially recover the mentor), and escalation arrives via intensifying phenomena (eyes animate, patterns shift, vision appears). The tightening is primarily a knowledge deepening rather than a foreclosed option, and the price is conceptual rather than paid on the page. It’s credible and cohesive but never truly corners her. The final move—accepting a new path—feels earned but low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake: preserve and surface essential knowledge without exposure. The meaningful tightening arrives with the discovery that the fragment contains original schematics tied to the current outage, which reweights the protagonist’s mission. Escalation remains quiet; tension is philosophical more than peril‑driven, and the cost of the final decision is more thematic than visceral. A visible trade‑off under time pressure would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (method vs vitality) tightens to a decisive test: she removes protections before a storm. Cost is visible in partial destruction; benefit is not cleanly free, keeping stakes honest. Escalation is coherent, though mostly internal and observational until the late decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to surrender the talisman for a larger creative responsibility—tightens through the exchange. Cost is explicit (giving up the brooch’s comfort) and paid on‑page. Pressure is quiet and humane rather than suspenseful, with no hard reversal beyond the internal turn. Effective at this length, if not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure builds texturally (shadows thicken, detach, inhabit), reweighting Elara’s options from analysis to activation/acceptance. The decisive move is her choice to touch the shadow-infused crystal and embrace creation over prediction. Still, stakes stay largely conceptual; there’s little on-page jeopardy or price beyond identity shift. The tightening is clear but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—reknitting communal meaning post‑exile—is clear early. The main tightening/deepening arrives with the herald’s revealed sacrifice, which reconfigures the community’s emotional options. Pressure remains gentle; consequences are more thematic than hard‑priced, and Elina’s agency is primarily curatorial and declarative. Still, the knowledge turn credibly narrows how anger can be held and redirected.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—accessing the fortress/truths—is established early and tightened by the vault’s limited window. The key deepening is the translation beam revealing what tickets “mean,” reframing the quest from travel to truth. The cost is mostly deferred and conceptual, which mutes urgency. Still, the flicker forces a choice to leave and commit to return, providing a credible narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (whether to keep the tile private or open it to others) is legible, and the decision provides the single tightening. Escalation remains gentle: discovery → transcription → visions → choice; there’s little friction or concrete opposition. Consequences (skeptical visitors) register briefly without altering tactics. Pressure stays abstract, muting urgency and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are immense but largely abstract; the piece lacks an on‑page obstacle or reversal that tests resolve. Escalation occurs via discovery (amulet → Elara’s role → portal), but options aren’t meaningfully narrowed beyond “go or stay.” The price of leaving is underdeveloped on the page. Agency is present but not challenged.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are legible early (job/charges vs Thorne’s execution), and pressure coheres through the timed breach. Escalation is modest—no real setback or reversal—but the safe opening, seal weight, and stamping provide a credible tightening. The price is conceptual (breached trust) more than visceral; it lands but could cut deeper on the page. Agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve temporal textures—tightens around the dawn beat; the refracted hum is the clear pressure point. Escalation is internal and procedural rather than oppositional, but coherent. The price is endurance and disciplined restraint, not a trade‑off that forecloses a new path, limiting peak intensity. Still, the cadence shift meaningfully reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—constructing a viable identity after bureaucratic erasure—is clear, and pressure coheres via tides, isolation, and the port’s indifference. Escalation is more deepening than turning; the significant tightening is the acceptance that the prior name no longer matters. The felt price is the ongoing namelessness and endurance rather than a fresh loss. Effective, if quiet, under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the riddle—is clear; escalation arrives via the cello unlocking specific memories and the compass’s sudden point to the chart. The key tightening is Evelyn choosing to complete a unifying melody that reframes the astronomers’ disagreement. Still, the pressure stays mostly conceptual; risks and prices are gentle, with little foreclosed path beyond interpretive comfort. The resolution is earned but low‑heat.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve culture amid privatization—is clear and coheres. Escalation tightens from discovery to organized responses to the posted terms, with one meaningful deepening (recognizing murals as encoded survival knowledge). Resolution flows from Maya’s agency; however, conflict remains largely procedural and offstage, with limited felt jeopardy in-scene. Still, the narrowing of options and timely tactics read earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around the time constraint and the impending habitat loss; escalation arrives as the grain nears dissolution and the fireflies peak, then fade. The agency is endurance and precision under a narrowing window, with a visible price (witnessing extinction). There’s no reversal beyond density/swell; it’s effective but safe. A complicating hitch (equipment, visibility, emotional falter) might have sharpened the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (fix the drone in time to support the apprentice/ship) is clear, with one deepening turn when the cracked sensor is found and repaired. Escalation is gentle; the piece lacks a sharp reversal or pronounced price beyond time and precision. The resolution is earned by Elias’s agency. Pressure coheres under a hybrid (textural/causal) lens but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (prove or discover the source) is clear, but escalation is soft: discoveries arrive without significant resistance or visible price. The key tightening is the decision to leave after the dream/condensation echo, leading to the on‑site confirmation. Absence of concrete obstacles or trade‑offs keeps cost low. Resolution is earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (revival vs. collapse) are legible and deepen through density and reach (window fusing, beam lifting, town-wide chord). Pressure accrues rather than reverses; there’s no hard turn that forecloses options, and antagonism is ambient. Agency is steady and effective, with minimal resistance beyond scale and time. The final strike is earned but comes without a palpable price spike.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (oxygen vs unlocking the temple) are signaled early; the key tightening is the choice to override survival training and commit to the mechanism. The cost is present in the oxygen alarm/burning lungs and the door resealing, foreclosing retreat paths. Escalation is mostly linear and clean rather than multi‑reversal, but at this length it suffices. Convenience lowers the grind of pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is belief/redemption under a time pressure (“before they find the bodies”). Escalation is minimal: a declared decision rather than a pressured turn that forecloses options on the page. No reversal or concrete loss mid‑scene changes tactics; tension accrues mainly via motif. The ending stance crystallizes but without unmistakable on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and clear (repay the debt/transition), with a meaningful tightening at midnight that forces action before she fades. The bead’s impending crumble creates a tacit clock; her choice carries an on‑page price. Escalation is elegant rather than tense; a bit more friction in execution could intensify pressure. Still, the agency at the peak beat is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (restore the sacred) is clear and the pressure deepens as the villagers discover the nocturnal work. Yet resistance is low and obstacles are largely internal (fatigue), with minimal friction or reversal. Escalation is a steady density build rather than a sharp tightening; cost is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reconstituting faith/home—remains coherent and is tested through sustained effort and ritualized attention. Escalation occurs via the sundial’s assembly and the increasing “recognition” between caretaker and artifact. Still, obstacles are minimal, with no significant reversal or foreclosed option beyond time and patience. The resolution is earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are coherent (mail the letter before noon; preserve clandestine craft), but escalation is minimal. The chalk coding and the impending maglev departure do not force a trade-off or foreclose a live option. Resolution is essentially a serene follow-through rather than a pressured choice with visible price. Tension remains mostly thematic, not situational.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (prevent the coup) are clear and the pressure tightens when the “impossible” alignment reveals scheduled assassinations. The strategic pivot—opt for subtle delays over confrontation—reweights tactics credibly. Still, resistance meets little direct pushback, and no option is truly foreclosed on the page. The opposition’s presence (officials’ disdain) adds texture but not concrete jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates through a meaningful deepening (from generic apology to the specific fear). Agency exists (placing the shard, focusing energy, choosing compassion), but external pressures are forgiving and coincidence-leaning; little is truly at risk beyond internal stance. The tightening is real yet subdued, with minimal visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—helping the child articulate grief tonight—is coherent and signaled early. Escalation is a textural deepening: deciphering the cast’s lines narrows interpretation and compels the whispered reframing. The price is subtle but present: he assumes the burden of hope while acknowledging death’s persistence. Pressure doesn’t sharply tighten, but the cadence shift is sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (recover joy, revive community memory) is clear, but escalation is gentle and largely unopposed. The key tightening—the public display—doesn’t visibly foreclose options or exact a price; doubt from the council is waved past. Tension operates more as steady unveiling than pressure. Emotional risk is implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on whether Elena maintains old certainties or surrenders to a new, riskier mode of seeing. Escalation is a density increase via nested awakenings, with a meaningful turn when she paints eyes closed and another when she returns the nickel. Pressure remains gentle; there’s little opposition beyond her comfort zone, so cost is more implied than felt. Nonetheless, the cadence tightens toward a reweighted end-state.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stakes are clear, but pressure rises chiefly by worldbuilding increments rather than on-page reversals. The tomato/aphid exchange and “nationwide resistance” signal deepen context, yet Kaelen doesn’t face a narrowing choice with an immediate price. The final beat promises a consequential move “tomorrow,” avoiding paying cost today. Escalation is coherent but under-realized in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are largely internal—maintain hope vs. encroaching despair—with one credible tightening when “darkness threatened” and the poet must sing louder. The cost is endurance culminating in death, but pressure remains gentle rather than knife-edged. The postcard and blossoms function as evolving counters to despair, cohering under the chosen lens. Absence of on-page resistance beyond the abstract keeps tension from peaking higher.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the chime’s names—is clear with one tightening: the crack creates silence, forcing the ritual repair and the choice of cylinder. Escalation is gentle; no antagonist or significant setback beyond the silent interim after repair. The felt price is existential (dwindling purpose, inevitability of loss) rather than immediate. Effective but low-friction conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear and time‑boxed (“before paths diverge”), with real deepening when she finds the ceremonial text with consequences. Escalation is primarily internal/knowledge‑driven; there’s one meaningful tightening but few on‑page trade‑offs. The cost is implied—risk of dismissal, the ink well drained—but not paid yet. Tension works, though the conflict remains largely preparatory.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are stated (community water vs. heritage) and a single tightening occurs via the adhesive’s clue and inscription. However, opposition is entirely offstage and the pressure remains gentle; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond choosing a hybrid design. The emotional and practical cost is muted, so escalation reads more like deepening contemplation than true squeeze. The ending resolves without a contested turn.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure coheres through a steady intensification: discovery → ritualized use → letter → release. The dominant stake (risking her heart and work again) is clear, but opposition is gentle and largely internal, producing a soft escalation. The choice forecloses the safer identity, yet the on‑page cost is mostly tonal rather than materially felt. A minor complication or loss at the letter/release juncture would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding/recognizing a sacred threshold that leads to home) is present early and tightens as the hush deepens and the oak pattern matches the logbook. The decisive deepening occurs when she abandons logic for intuition and commits to the doorway. Price is implied (risk of the unknown; relinquishing the liminal search) but not strongly tested or opposed on the page. Tension is mostly inner and atmospheric rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is existential—belonging/connection—and it deepens when the creatures mirror the constellation and the feather becomes a map. Yet pressure never tightens into a dilemma or trade-off; coincidence and wonder do most of the work. Agency is mostly attentive endurance rather than choice under cost, so the escalation feels low-stakes. The sunrise clock provides cadence more than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is present but the pressure scarcely tightens; the seed germinates instantly and resolves the inquiry with minimal resistance. There’s no meaningful loss, trade-off, or narrowed option on the page. The escalation reads as a gentle deepening rather than a test. Resolution is earned but easy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (creating a serendipitous moment) is clear, and there’s a single tightening when the woman pauses—Leo acts. Yet pressure is minimal and nothing truly resists him; coincidence doesn’t undercut, but neither does the scene force a trade-off beyond the bishop’s gift. The quartet’s entry is a deepening, not a reversal. The result is satisfying but not strenuous.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory against the ban—tightens through the moonstone’s call and the acceptance of anchoring, which forecloses mobility. The meaningful turn is the anchoring-as-choice, with visible cost and reconfigured options. Pressure grows coherently under the accumulative lens, even without an antagonist. Tension is more textural than oppositional, but the price at closure is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is internal clarity before the day’s “shift,” and the pressure coheres but remains gentle. The tightening occurs at the stone‑cast and pattern reading, yet no option is clearly foreclosed and price is largely conceptual. Without an antagonist or harder trade‑off, tension stays low. Earned, but subdued, escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: reframing guilt into a survivable stance. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, culminating when the fracture reads as “a deliberate stroke.” The price is continuing with markedness, not absolution. Slight softness remains from a largely internal conflict without a sharper mid‑scene pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on whether his patterns can “revitalize” possibility; pressure escalates when the gauge spins wildly and then fixes on him. The tightening is felt but gentle; no option is forcefully foreclosed beyond a stance shift. Agency drives the turn (recalibrating weights), but explicit cost remains modest. The result is convincing but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes remain largely abstract (understanding/preservation) with limited on-page pressure; conflict is discovery rather than opposition. The meaningful tightening arrives with the film’s reveal, deepening knowledge but not foreclosing options or exacting a visible price. Agency is present but untested. A concrete risk, loss, or moral trade-off would amplify stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (catch the mirrors at the hush) is clear, with a real clock and a crescendo against the bells. Pressure tightens via density and timing more than opposition; the rain’s amplification adds a subtle deepening. The cost manifests as letting go of possibilities and her heartbeat‑link easing. It’s elegant but low‑friction, keeping tension effective yet not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are monumental, but on-page pressure largely unfolds via summary (“successfully navigated the first breach”) rather than dramatized reversals or costs. One meaningful tightening arrives with the treaty’s signing and the subsequent sight of “cracks,” but the escalation lacks a concrete turn forced by Elian’s choice in-scene. The closing endurance stance is coherent yet under-tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (whether he will release the egg) is clear, and the tightening comes via thunder’s approach and the move to the crack-convergence. The price is internal and symbolic rather than contested, so external pressure is low and risk minimal. Still, the renunciation is consequential within the frame and coherently escalated. A live counterforce on the page would have sharpened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (unlocking the sanctuary/liberating consciousness) is clear; pressure coheres via density increase and cadence tightening to the meridian. Escalation is present (flicker → intensified movement → final thread), yet the path faces little resistance and the price of success feels low. Agency drives the turn, but a single tangible trade‑off or threatened failure would clarify stakes. The “because/therefore” chain is weak, but the accumulative deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are ethical and reputational; pressure builds modestly as the bar quiets and the audience softens. Escalation is present but safe; risk and cost remain mostly off‑page. One tightening—choosing to confront homelessness narratives—drives the middle, but no live option is clearly foreclosed. Consequences are gestured at (critics, mentor) rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving/marking a vanishing pattern) tightens from witnessing to making and finally releasing the signal. The decisive deepening is Aris attaching the moth wing, converting memory into a live beacon that draws acknowledgment. The cost is elegiac rather than sharp, but legible: a one‑night reprieve against irreversible loss. Tension is quiet yet coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving names—is clear early and tightens as she manipulates the rope, culminating in the illumination and vow. Escalation is mostly a smooth intensification rather than a contested battle; the risk of breaking ancestral threads is implied but not dramatized as a near-loss. The final trade-off (choosing to stay) gives the needed cost and resolution. A sharper on-page jeopardy would heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—experiencing the present—tightens through the approaching storm and the ritual leading to dream-bridging. The escalation is clear but largely internal and risk‑soft; there’s little sense of potential failure cost beyond missing the chance. The turn lands when the directive reframes as a map and she achieves presence. Effective but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (unlock/secure covenant before the regime shift) is legible early and tightens through the equinox window and the candle’s omen. The major turn is Anu choosing to uncloak and press his hands to the tile. Stakes deepen conceptually with the marks, but material cost or loss isn’t confronted on the page. The external pressure (Nebuchadnezzar) remains atmospheric rather than directly constraining tactics in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—releasing resentment—tightens through the tactile “listening” and intensified reality shifts. The key turn is Elara’s convincing via embodied memory, but the resistance phase is brief and the price of letting go is underplayed. The brother’s appearance resolves external tension swiftly, reducing pressure at the peak. Still, internal and external lines interweave adequately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming the sextant to reach the dream and decide what to do with it—is present, with one meaningful deepening when the instrument points inside the workshop. Escalation reads through intensifying ritual and perception rather than obstacles; resistance is low and costs remain mostly conceptual. The refusal to capture is an earned stance crystallization but not sharply pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reconnection) is established and tightened as Elara converts keepsakes into a bridge and returns to test the world’s answer. Escalation is modest but functional: craft → illumination → overnight bloom → footprints/seed, each reweighting hope and cost. Prices (physical fatigue, exposure of grief, surrendering the ribbon) are legible though understated. The off‑page return of the daughter softens direct pressure, keeping this shy of a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (pursue forbidden knowledge despite cost) is signaled, and escalation occurs via density: discovery → containment → bathroom breakthrough → lab activation. The tightening is mostly internal and knowledge‑driven; the monitors’ response is the clearest pressure turn. He chooses to proceed, but the cost remains abstract and untested on the page, muting the felt consequence. No reversals, but the deepening is coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (rescue) is clear, but pressure escalates lightly: the guardians concede after one negotiation beat, and the extraction is summarized rather than contested on the page. The tightening doesn’t force a visible trade-off or cost. Agency drives turns, yet no credible loss or hard choice narrows options. Tension is present but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering identity and honoring forgotten names—is present early and tightens as Elara chooses to engage with the memories. The most meaningful turn is pressing the tree and allowing the influx, foreclosing a simpler, self‑contained path. Opposition is largely atmospheric; tension is internal and conceptual rather than conflict‑driven. The price (living others’ lives at the cost of fully living her own) reads, but not as an on‑page crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are legible (solve vanishings; avoid triggering new ones), but pressure is soft and encounters no resistance. The meaningful tightening is Eleanor deciding to reconfigure the rope under a narrow celestial window. Still, there’s no visible trade‑off or loss; the warnings never become a force she must push against. The resolution arrives smoothly without testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (preserve the ripple marks) and the pressure coheres, but resistance is soft and the path to solution is linear. The primary tightening—sustaining the bloom of hush while beings waver—doesn’t foreclose a meaningful option or extract a noticeable price. The energy beings’ quick accommodation further reduces friction. The resolution feels earned but low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are singular (rekindle to prove meaning), but pressure is low: no counterforce beyond time and uncertainty. The escalation beat (meteor triggers the attempt) works, yet risk and trade‑off remain abstract; success arrives quickly after one try. The price—light’s fragility and ongoing solitude—lands, but without a hard on‑page test.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving and reconstructing memory—does not encounter strong opposition; escalation is a gentle deepening (listening → shadow study → vow). The meaningful tightening is his choice to remain below with the forecourt’s hush, a small but clear foreclosure. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens, yet tangibly paid cost and narrowed options are light. No real reversal or test of commitment beyond attention and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (piercing collective despair) is signaled, but pressure rarely narrows options; the path from discovery to performance is unimpeded. Escalation arrives mainly via intensifying spectacle rather than trade‑offs or foreclosed routes. The starless night provides atmospheric pressure, not a concrete clock. The performance is bold but encounters no reversal that forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (whether and how the work continues under scarce funding) is signaled early, and the meaningful tightening is her reframing of constraint into method. Pressure escalates internally, but external stakes never bite on the page; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond a declared acceptance of uncertainty. The resumed conversation offers direction (sustainable models) without a concrete trade‑off or loss. Tension exists but stays gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—to attain and contain the gilded hush under a ticking one‑hour inversion—is clear and tightens once at the trellis. However, resistance is low: the ascent is largely unhindered, so the test of commitment leans inward more than oppositional. The visible price is leaving the hush and accepting return to the underground world. The hour window maintains tension, but a sharper on‑page complication would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes center on whether Elias can realize his healing soundscape in the post‑whistle hush; escalation is mostly density and calm deepening. The only complication—gathering dark clouds—arrives late and doesn’t alter tactics beyond a reflective acknowledgment. There’s no live option foreclosed or price visibly paid. The piece functions, but pressure is modest and largely untested.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—complete the ritual before sunrise—is present, with one meaningful tightening at the murals/map beat. Escalation is steady but gentler than the clock suggests; no true reversal or on‑page opposition tests her resolve beyond time pressure. The final act is her decision to awaken rather than claim, but the price isn’t sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve isolating peace vs answer a call that hurts—tightens through the ring’s insistence and the ritual’s three‑beat cadence. The meaningful turn is her decision to encroach and knock; the visible price is leaving the sanctuary and reigniting scars. Pressure coheres and grows toward the student’s suffocation scene. Stakes skew a touch abstract at times, but the final trade‑off reads.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is clear, but pressure escalates modestly; warnings about danger do not manifest as tangible setbacks. The search resolves without reversal, and the activation succeeds on first try. The price of breaking rules or risking safety is implied but not dramatized. The tightening is present yet mild.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is legible early (uncover the dynasty’s secret) and the pressure tightens as he dials toward resonance and the room begins to respond. Still, conflict feels low‑friction: no real obstacle challenges commitment or forces a trade‑off. The “thin veil” timing adds atmosphere more than pressure. The decisive beat is earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates through density: from reading to practicing to the decisive “unsnap.” Agency drives the turn, and the ritual tightens pressure with a courage/surrender demand. However, opposition remains largely internal and smooth; prices paid are conceptual, not dramatized as trade‑offs in scene. One added friction or cost would deepen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning/connection through unknown histories—tightens from solitary investigation to human contact. The meaningful deepening arrives via the photo mismatch and the eventual arrival of Benjamin, but on-page cost is mostly emotional and muted. The pressure never truly pinches into a hard trade-off. Still, the reunion reweights options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure escalates plausibly: increased patrols, changing protocols, alarms at the climax. Mara’s agency drives the turn and resolution, and the live clock (dawn) plus discovery raise stakes. However, options never feel truly narrowed by a concrete loss or failure, and the escape is smooth, muting cost. The tightening is present but mild at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (silence the prophecy), and pressure tightens via urgency in the playing and the sense of a “vested hush” answering back. Escalation is mostly density and cadence rather than reversal; it’s effective but low on concrete risk or loss. The final stillness reads as earned by Ethan’s agency. The world‑shaking stakes remain abstract and untested beyond the chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (read the leaves to warn the dwellers) is present and the moonstone deepens urgency, but on-page resistance is mild and largely procedural. Escalation occurs as a pattern break rather than live opposition, with little foreclosed path or paid price. The decode arrives smoothly, limiting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—can he embrace uncertainty—tightens through the improvised descent and the discovery of living clocks. The ladder beat is a credible narrowing of options and shows adaptation. However, danger and consequence are underplayed; tension releases quickly, and the emotional price of giving up precision remains low‑heat. Resolution is earned by stance change rather than a sharpened trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is clear but escalation is gentle: despair to plan to successful forging without a real obstacle or trade‑off on the page. The felt cost is primarily internal acceptance, with no on‑scene setback testing commitment. Pressure coheres but never tightens decisively under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—coaxing confession and release—tightens from search to intimate negotiation. Pressure grows coherently, but resistance is modest and the spirit yields relatively quickly. The meaningful turn is the shift from confession to laughter as necessary completion. Cost is gentle (emotional endurance and legacy burden) rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—making survival meaningful—tightens when Kai surrenders to trauma responses and then risks aligning the strap to the forest’s patterns. The activation beat deepens options/knowledge rather than reversing them, appropriate for the chosen lens. The visible price is psychological and embodied; endurance becomes agency. Stakes remain internal but coherent and rising.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (unlock and honor buried histories) is clear, but pressure remains low: little resistance or risk complicates the approach to the painting. The single tightening beat—touching the fragment to “unfasten the final lock”—arrives without prior setbacks. Emotional or practical cost is kept abstract. The resolution reads as fulfillment rather than a tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure coheres around the time window and the room’s thinning barrier; the spirits’ appearance raises stakes. The meaningful turn is his choice to engage rather than fear, using the mainspring. However, the price of that choice is implied rather than dramatized (no hard trade-off or visible loss), softening escalation. Tension is steady, not razor-tight.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early; pressure deepens from discovery → preparation → rupture → reconfiguration. The meaningful tightening is the unbinding of the bottled whisper, which forecloses the path of static preservation. Cost is legible: loss of the perfect system and identity shift of Eldon’s role. Slight limitation: the turn is more system‑driven than choice‑driven at climax, keeping tension a touch abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (transcend the dispute through narrative) is signaled, and pressure coheres as the storm intensifies and he commits to the manuscript. Escalation is largely internal and textural; there’s no hard reversal or explicit price that forecloses a path beyond abandoning confrontation for creation. The closing read provides a reweighting, not a tested consequence. Effective but gentle, with limited felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is explicit and tracked by the live clock. Pressure rises (evening → 11 strikes → midnight) with one meaningful tightening and a clear payoff. Yet obstacles scarcely bite—no failed attempt or meaningful trade-off before the stone flares—so cost remains low. Escalation is coherent but smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on crossing the boundary of explanation; escalation arrives through the descent, immersion, and progressive awakenings. Agency is present (choosing the crevice, stepping chest‑deep, vial collection), but tangible risk/cost is light and external antagonism absent. The tightening is conceptual rather than coercive; it works here but limits intensity. The final revaluation is earned, not shocking.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain internal and low-pressure: find inspiration/meaning in a liminal space. The main tightening is the slide’s reveal and her decision to create; there’s no credible loss, trade-off, or foreclosed path beyond a gentle renunciation of GPS. Pressure does not intensify; coincidence (finding the slide) catalyzes rather than Elena’s prior struggle forcing a choice. The story resolves without a felt price or a tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (understanding nocturnal blooming) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when she gains after‑hours access and works under moonlight. Pressure escalates quietly via density and pattern rather than opposition, fitting the lens. The price is mostly sleeplessness and long pursuit; no on‑page trade‑off is forced at the peak. The resolution is earned but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—escaping retrocognitive snare and reclaiming truthful history—is legible, and pressure coheres as she shifts from researcher to ritualist. The meaningful tightening occurs in the beach sequence where she commits to an uncertain method; the water’s response deepens options and knowledge. However, conflict resolves with relative ease once the lagoon accepts her message; explicit on‑page cost or a trade‑off at the peak is muted. The weeks‑later publication is a satisfying payoff but occurs in summary, diffusing immediate consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (reviving the town’s spirit) is clear, but pressure is largely internal and low‑friction. The tightening beat is the night of planning leading to public commitment, yet there’s little explicit price or foreclosed alternative on the page. No antagonist or hard obstacle tests resolve; tension is more aspirational than contested. The final action is earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake clarifies after the prophecy: preserve the city’s emotional patterns before collapse. Escalation is a single deepening—the immersion triggers a future‑facing vision that forces a stance. The price is mostly deferred (burden, urgency), lacking a sharper on‑page trade‑off. Still, the pivot from recording oaths to city‑scale preservation is a credible tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accrues through density rather than opposition: the meticulous ordering narrows to a single culminating placement. Stakes remain internal and conceptual; the cost is implied (mortality acceptance) more than painfully felt. The turn at vortex‑appearance is earned by her agency and method. A touch more friction or a foreclosed alternative path would heighten price clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: prove the bell can pre‑warn the storm and thus save lives. Escalation reads as tightening signals (pressure shifts, clouds, rope tension) leading to his high‑commitment reroute. The price—abandoning standard triggers on a critical night—adds friction, though danger remains more inferred than felt. The cadence shift at the bell’s note is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is internal—will he risk vulnerability to deepen connection—and escalation arrives with the “call” and his step into the void. Pressure grows more in density than opposition; no strong counterforce challenges him, so trade-offs feel soft. The tightening is present (tools versus glass; safety versus openness) but lacks a palpable price. Resolution flows smoothly, perhaps too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—proving worth through silence—and tightens with the anniversary vigil, where agency is a deliberate refusal to speak. The opening click and bee release reweight options and finalize a stance with a visible cost (lifelong custodianship of silence). Escalation is quiet but genuine, moving from study to ritualized test to role assumption. Stakes remain intimate, never grandiose, which suits the lens and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes center on comprehension and stewardship of temporal knowledge, but pressure is gentle and rarely narrows options. The suspension between seconds is the lone intensification; it yields insight rather than forcing a trade‑off. No clear loss or foreclosed path appears on the page. Resolution is internal and credible but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (unlocking authentic language/stance) tightens at the kite’s snap—an effective pattern break that reweights her process and frees the line. The cost is quiet but present (embracing loss and imperfection). Pressure is coherent though largely internal, with one meaningful deepening rather than escalation. No antagonist is needed under this lens, but the tradeoffs feel gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (build the bridge before death) is signaled early and escalates via time pressure and physical decline. The meaningful tightening occurs at the final circuit, where stamina and precision undercut options. Resistance is primarily entropic (time/body), not antagonistic, which keeps tension lower but coherent. The price—his life—registers cleanly at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding “homecoming”) is clear and tightens through approach and ritual action; the footprints and convergence point provide a palpable narrowing. Escalation is primarily tonal/density‑based rather than oppositional, appropriate to the lens. The price paid—identity shift and the surrender of the amber—registers but without a hard squeeze. One decisive intensification (placing the amber) lands.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are coherent (restore concord by making the battlefield bloom), but antagonistic pressure is gentle and largely environmental. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bird refocuses him to the western hollow and as pods dwindle by dawn. Costs are present but light (exhaustion, scarcity), with little resistance beyond terrain and time. Resolution is earned but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (find Elara/home) and there is one meaningful tightening at the coordinate reveal that forces a course change. Yet the journey is largely summarized without obstacles testing commitment, and no live trade‑off is dramatized on the page beyond leaving the settlement. Tension stays gentle; pressure coheres but barely escalates. The resolution feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are largely internal—preserve knowledge, find “true north”—and there’s little escalation beyond a deepening of resolve. The “pulsing” compass moment tilts cadence but doesn’t foreclose options. No antagonistic pressure or real-time obstacle tests her goal. The result is resonant but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (mend fractured time/sky) is stated early, yet escalation is mostly procedural: each piece opens a door without setback or trade-off. The mentor’s speech resolves uncertainty rather than intensifying it; no option is foreclosed en route to the lid. The final act is decisive but low-cost, so tension never crests. A meaningful obstacle or sacrifice would sharpen the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—resisting erasure—tightens as her ritual escalates from “remember” to “witness,” yielding the pawn. The meaningful deepening arrives with the materialized pawn and the explicit ethical tradeoff (she cannot save all). Pressure is primarily internal and textural; it coheres but remains modest in force. The cost is clear but not heavily tested by opposing agents in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is legible, with one meaningful deepening (hidden thunder intensifies toward the full‑moon reveal). Pressure, however, seldom forecloses options; opposition is minimal and cost largely implied. Escalation reads as density rather than narrowing. Resolution is earned but comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (self‑forgiveness/freeing the village) is signaled early and tightened by the shrinking lull (“two minutes remained”). The meaningful turn is the final thread’s placement triggering the bell/door, with internal and external stakes merging in the prince’s offered hand. Opposition is mostly constraint‑based rather than agentive, but pressure coheres and rises. The felt price is long penance and the risk of judgment, not spectacle.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are singular and clear (defy absolutism before the ritual at personal risk), and pressure tightens via the approaching hour and Overseers’ attention. Escalation is primarily rhythmic and thematic rather than through a concrete reversal or confrontation. The final stance is earned but the price isn’t tested in a decisive clash. One meaningful tightening is present, but the felt cost stays conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (cohering a fractured self via ritual) is signaled early and deepened as he confronts specific losses. Pressure builds through the act of matching scars to memories and the workshop’s tilt, culminating in an internal stance crystallization. The tightening is credible but quiet; there’s no sharp foreclosed option beyond an implicit renunciation of erasure in favor of repair. Cost is felt but mostly historical rather than newly extracted.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are internal—memory versus erasure—and escalate when the cave yields the shell with his inscription, narrowing him toward action. The visible cost is emotional (tears, acceptance of aging and loss), and the final move (painting the masterpiece) is earned. Pressure remains gentle; no hard reversal or scarce options beyond his internal turn keeps this from the high band. Still, the deepening is clear and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are intimate (reach the sister, prove the theory) but pressure doesn’t truly tighten beyond waiting and hoping. There’s no reversal or credible loss that forces adaptation; the method succeeds on first try. The captain’s skepticism doesn’t escalate into an obstacle. The piece reads as a gentle test rather than a contested trial.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (safe passage) is clear; pressure coheres through the midnight instruction, lunar peak, and the ship’s approach. Escalation feels like an intensification rather than a reversal; the censer’s heat and the live approach furnish modest cost and urgency. The navigator’s agency drives the configuration and the channeling decision. A sharper on-page tradeoff or threatened failure would lift pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (regain agency over empathy) is clear, and pressure accumulates through the ritual, the intensifying weather, and the final self‑naming. The tightening beat is credible, though the discovery of a second eye reduces friction by leaning on fate. Internal and external threads interweave with modest but steady tension. Costs and trade‑offs are felt but not sharply tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are intimate but coherent: understanding the gesture to resolve intrusive memories and loneliness. Escalation arrives via density and knowledge deepening—borrowed shards cohere into a narrative that narrows options to ritual reenactment. The visible cost is quiet (a relinquishment rather than a confrontation), fitting the scale. A slightly greater on‑page friction or competing option might have sharpened the turn further.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will he accept an active life and choose a path—arrives early and coheres through the journey. Escalation is gentle: the ants’ trek, the timed arrival, and the doorway projection narrow options toward a single choice. The price is largely internal, trading safety for risk; it reads but could tighten with a sharper on‑page constraint. Agency drives the climax; coincidence initiates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (risking body and crown to seek the dream’s truth) is clear, and the climb/grotto encounter delivers one meaningful deepening. Pressure escalates physically into the grotto but eases quickly once Maera explains, softening the test of commitment. The choice to approach the starlight reads as the hinge, yet opposition is low friction and costs remain mostly conceptual. Resolution is internally driven and consistent, if not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—how the secret reconfigures Elara’s art—is set early and tightens at the whisper. Escalation is internal and textural rather than confrontational; it deepens but only modestly narrows options. The chosen “gentlest technique” is a soft but real commitment that closes one path (mere preservation). Absence of a visible price or counter‑pressure from Leo limits peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (making narrative from chaos) is clear, with one meaningful deepening when he yields to the glow and “soars.” The escalation is internal and cadence‑based, culminating in a recommitment to chronicling. The price—accepting mortality and time fracture as a permanent condition—is felt but not dramatized through a trade‑off that forecloses an alternate path. Tension is steady rather than tightening to a pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes stay intimate: Elara’s meaning post‑loss and Lena’s attachment to lineage. The main tightening is Lena’s confession and Elara’s chosen response, culminating in the return of the screw as a bridge; tension rises modestly but coherently. Prices are subtle (acceptance of loss; vulnerability in sharing), with no strong foreclosure of options. Quiet escalation fits the lens but limits intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is focused: complete transformation before the storm without crystallizing. Escalation is legible and organic—the platform’s tilt spikes pressure, crystallization prickles, and she must adapt tactics via superstition. The price is palpable (risk of losing dexterity mid‑spell); resolution is earned by endurance and precise action, not luck. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reconnect/apologize before the orchard’s end) is clear; pressure tightens when the field intensifies and the orchard stirs. The price is the brevity of contact and the acceptance that healing is partial. Escalation is mostly lyric rather than combative, but the live clock and energy arc provide a concrete squeeze. Slight softness: ritual risk feels low beyond the countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (unify before the hiccup ends), and pressure coheres as the center is reached and the final act is taken. Escalation is primarily cadence/depth rather than obstacles; the “Unify” command and the glowing dictionary are the decisive intensifications. The cost (loss of separateness) reads, but remains abstract. No real reversal or foreclosed option beyond the all‑in merge.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are internal—whether Arlo can reconfigure his understanding of time—and escalate via the reversal experiment and counting cadence. The visible price is a renunciation of conventional practice and a reoriented stance toward duty. Pressure remains coherent but low‑temperature; no hard foreclosure beyond the vow. The deepening lands, but the conflict never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake and tightens when she modifies the barrier and steps out. The reciprocal stranger response deepens options and narrows interpretation. However, stakes feel largely conceptual and low-risk; visible cost is soft. The final boundary-touch is a meaningful cadence shift but lacks a sharper price.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal: reconcile gambler fatalism with probabilistic ethics. The meaningful tightening arrives when she chooses reinterpretation over decoding/exploitation; it forecloses a path implied by her father’s worldview. Pressure coheres through the Fibonacci discovery and its thematic temptation. The price is understated, more endurance and renunciation than loss.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are quiet but clear: risk re‑entry into connection vs. remain safely estranged. Escalation is a single tightening—wrong number becomes a conduit for grief—leading to a stance change. The price is soft on the page (no explicit sacrifice beyond exposure), so tension remains largely tonal rather than scene‑driven. Still, the shift from passive maintenance to active waiting reads earned within the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates as daylight dwindles and “last act” urgency sets a soft clock. The tightening arrives via cadence shift to night and the sealing/packing, foreclosing a path. Cost is felt but the pressure remains largely internal and steady, with no serious test that forces adaptation beyond ritual control. The lack of a sharper on‑page pinch keeps it below higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (transforming loneliness into connection) is clear, and pressure accumulates as the rumor spreads through distinct channels. The decisive move is his proactive launch; the deepening is the public phenomenon and his follow-up calls. Still, escalation lacks a concrete obstacle or loss that narrows options; risk remains conceptual (ethical exposure) rather than stressed on the page. The cost is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal—finding the stillpoint to recalibrate grief—and they tighten with the shift from hum to silence. Escalation reads as pattern intensification (notes to melody to stillness) rather than reversal, which fits the lens but keeps the sense of price soft. The decisive kneel/press moment is agentive yet not contested by meaningful risk beyond emotional exposure. The cost is felt but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (course-correct research without brute rewriting), but escalation is gentle and largely uncontested. The “unprecedented” attempt succeeds on the first try, with no counterpressure beyond internal nerves. The tightening is present (committing the suggestion), yet consequences are small and come off-stage, limiting felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on honoring silence versus personal erasure; pressure deepens as the crowd gathers and his signing weaves multiple silences. The cost is conceptual yet felt, with a cadence lift near the end. Still, there’s no sharp on‑page dilemma or foreclosed option beyond the standing condition of forgettability. Tension is steady rather than tightening into a hard test.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—redemption via preserving stories—is legible early and tightens through the restoration task and the self‑recognition in the portrait. Escalation is more deepening than reversal; the decisive turn is choosing to rebuild and remain below. The emotional cost (renunciation of the world above; years of labor) is clear but mostly told, which mutes intensity. No coincidences resolve the arc; agency drives the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconnection with Theo—tightens via the engineered blackout and the mounting performance on the tower. The main turn is Elena’s successful creation of the lagoon and Theo’s partial return, immediately counterweighted by the systems reboot. Costs are emotional and situational rather than punitive, but they’re legible. Pressure coheres without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—prove whispers’ superiority—and tightens with the ticking clock and storm intensification. The key turn (pre-sent whisper beating Vance’s shout) is earned and tactically driven. Yet the conflict never extracts a clear, felt price or forces a trade-off; risk remains abstract. The Vance encounter releases tension rather than posing a fresh test.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure coheres via the visitor’s unsaid secret, the intensifying pattern‑making, and the approach of dawn. Escalation is a density/scale increase (constellations → spiral galaxy → final star) rather than a reversal; stakes remain intimate and internal. The visible price is a chosen silence/endurance, which reads but is modest. The nod at the end crystallizes stance without venting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—challenging the town’s rigid educational philosophy—is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens: no setback, risk, or pushback interrupts the plan. The unveiling succeeds immediately; escalation is more procedural than contested. Without a visible price or narrowing of options at the turn, tension remains low. The outcome feels assured once the plan is conceived.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberation vs. shore-bound expectation—is signaled and tightens as the object activates and the island appears. The decisive turn is the detachment sequence and the resulting option to dive, which forecloses her former life. The cost is credible and felt; escalation remains coherent under the accumulative lens. Slight softness in external pressure keeps it just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (permission to feel versus mandate’s residue) is legible, and the piece deepens once with “protest against oblivion” toward the closing equilibrium. External pressure (town’s judgment) is present but offstage; escalation is mostly tonal rather than option‑narrowing. The cost—accepting isolation and ambiguity—is implied more than tested. Tension hums rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure grows texturally (hum → glow → ripple), but opposition is minimal and stakes remain largely spiritual/abstract. The key turn—paraphrasing and touching the quartz—is chosen, yet without a hard trade-off or narrowed options beyond proceeding. The cost is framed as new responsibility, not a contested sacrifice. The escalation is graceful but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is gentle: the main tightening is the completion of the Fibonacci arrangement, which triggers the awakening. There’s minimal resistance or risk; the outcome arrives without complication, so stakes feel safe. The cost angle (trading dexterity for acceptance) is largely asserted rather than dramatized. The result is lovely but low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain largely conceptual (connection across time) with one major deepening at the moment of resonance. Pressure does not escalate beyond discovery; no option is foreclosed or traded. The final stance is commitment to continue, not a costly crystallization. Tension exists as curiosity rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes center on grief transmuted into guidance, but pressure does not tighten beyond a steady accumulation of ritual. There’s no reversal or narrowed option; Elena’s agency is enduring rather than deciding under duress. The most dynamic beat—the origami as keys—spreads influence outward but doesn’t test her commitment. As a result, tension remains low though consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is whether to reveal and thus reorient the work from mapping to prevention. Pressure escalates modestly: arrival, vetting/hesitation, disclosure, joint work, then the reframing. Cost and resistance are soft; no option is truly foreclosed beyond the implied burden of responsibility. The turn reads more as opportunity than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are focused: gain access to lost consciousness versus loss of self. Pressure coheres as the atoms’ unpredictability forces her to sustain the anti‑pattern tactic, culminating in the merge. The tightening is unmistakable when the archive fades and she becomes the vessel, foreclosing prior options. Agency drives the outcome; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—understand the unbound shadow to safeguard hope—is signaled early and tightens when the anomaly approaches her station under the full moon. Escalation is a density shift rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price—regret and the foreclosed possibility of reunion—reads clearly. Agency is more endurance/attention than choice, keeping the ceiling just below top-band.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant internal stake is established early and coherently escalates through the shedding motif and the revealed betrayal’s pressure. The meaningful tightening is the reframing of trust as conscious, bounded choice, closing off former blind reliance. Cost is present but quiet, primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized confrontation. The cadence shift into dawn gives the needed turn without false drama.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on whether she will keep “opening wounds” or find a different ethic and return the miracle. Pressure escalates from disorientation to decipherment to action, but obstacles are minimal; the world yields without real resistance. The narrowing choice is credible, yet the price and external pressure remain gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether Elena can locate and release embedded emotions; escalation is a density deepening rather than adversarial conflict. The turn arrives when past projectionists manifest and the “letters” are recognized as fused to the film, prompting the decision to project. Costs are gently felt rather than sharp; the scene forgoes a harder trade‑off or external resistance. Still, the tightening is legible and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: transform cacophony into art or remain blocked. Escalation is modest but legible under the textural lens—the alignment, tracing, and responsive archway deepen and narrow options to the ritual. The cost is primarily internal and conceptual; no external risk, but the price of missed time is felt. The resolution is earned by her reframed tactic rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (preserve sparks against the void) is clear, but pressure remains mostly atmospheric. The main tightening is the entry and stabilization of the archive; resistance is minimal and largely procedural. The price of the final shift (choosing presence) is only lightly dramatized. Tension works more by cadence than by hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes center on comprehension and agency within the mindscape; escalation is gentle (gear warms, tones converge, nexus appears) and largely frictionless. The decisive act (placing the gear, choosing to sleep again) lacks a visible trade‑off or narrowed option, so pressure remains low. The piece deepens knowledge but rarely tightens choices or forces sacrifice. As a result, tension operates more as atmosphere than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure deepens via the heating punch and portal reveal, culminating in accepting the burden of invisible dragons. The dominant stake (locating unused courage) remains coherent; the turn in the cavern reweights purpose. Costs are implied (endless vigil, carrying courage) rather than dramatized as a trade-off in-scene. Escalation is steady but largely contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—keep sanctuary safety or return music—arrives early and coheres. Pressure escalates from a small anomaly to a moral choice, with the meaningful turn at the moment of singing. The felt price is present but largely conceptual; no concrete retaliation or breach manifests yet. Still, the narrowing of options and the endured risk are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear early (unmask the pretender) and escalate via the library’s reasserted time and increasingly urgent messages. The decisive tightening is Elara choosing the dangerous text and performing the ritual as the library collapses. The cost is primarily internal (identity revaluation), with setting loss as a corollary; it’s felt but soft compared to a concrete trade-off. Pressure reads coherent under the accumulative lens, if not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—comprehending erasure—tightens through insomnia, pattern-matching, and the data/atlas interplay. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price is conceptual and personal (accepting loss and limits of human agency), but explicit foreclosed alternatives are minimal on the page. The final stance (logging data after repricing) reads as earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are largely internal—recovering meaning to rekindle collective spirit—signaled early and intensified by the circle’s activation. Escalation is mostly atmospheric; there’s no antagonist or credible loss complicating tactics beyond the threshold step. The visible price is light, so the tightening does not markedly foreclose options. The piece earns a deepening but not a felt narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is legible early (unseal the chamber to enable a reimagined tradition). The tightening comes via decoding work and the spoken key, but escalation lacks a hard price or credible risk; coincidences (the gust lifting the kite) aid more than pressure. The climax resolves on first try with no meaningful trade‑off. The internal and external threads align yet remain low‑tension at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether she can hold love and loss without being capsized—tightens on the anniversary. The surfacing markers escalate pressure; her choice to let feelings wash over her and to release the photo forecloses a path. The price is clear: surrendering a physical anchor to grief. Quiet but earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (creative paralysis) is signaled early and tightens through the task of untangling and the steadier hand. The meaningful turn is a renunciation of perfection and a redesign of approach. Cost is felt but modest (living with the “luminescent ache” and imperfection). Pressure is internal and steady rather than sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates through a decisive, risky act that narrows options (stepping into the ink at the eclipse’s edge). The turn lands with tangible price (physiological destabilization, gasping, drone alarms). Pressure is coherent and agency-driven; no coincidence resolves the core problem. The final realization feels earned by the ordeal.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear early (truth vs. personal peril), and escalation moves from discovery to resolve to the irreversible send. Her agency drives the turn; the cost is named and felt in the waiting. The path is slightly frictionless—the upload faces no on‑page obstacle—which mutes peak tension. Nonetheless, one meaningful tightening lands cleanly for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (maintaining a sanctuary of values post-collapse) is clear but faces limited on-page resistance. The most concrete tightening is the act of working with a new cutting and reassigning the sandbag’s meaning—more deepening than escalation. No option is foreclosed in scene, and the price is largely inherited rather than tested. Tension stays atmospheric rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and sustained; escalation comes via density/patterning (constellations stirring; echo descending). Agency drives the outcome—net‑weaving, anchoring, final zigzag—yet the felt cost is muted. No real reversal; the tightening is a controlled deepening toward capture. The pressure remains coherent but rarely bites.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (truth vs. corruption, legacy) is signaled early and tightened by her methodological choice. Yet escalation is largely intellectual and told: obstacles don’t actively push back; the “win” comes smoothly overnight. Costs and foreclosed options aren’t made concrete on the page. Tension hums rather than tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (quieting guilt through sound) is signaled early and coheres. Escalation tightens as he initiates the tether and the amber “moves,” culminating in the lullaby; agency drives the turn. However, opposition is low-friction—no snag or complication tests his resolve on the page—so the price feels mostly pre‑paid by backstory. The earned stasis at the end still reads credible.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (meaning vs. imposed order) tightens when zealots arrive; Silas’s artistic interjection is the decisive turn. Pressure escalates through the mandala’s resonance making the whispers legible to all. The price is mainly conceptual (letting others find meaning; dismantling the work) rather than a hard loss, so the felt cost is modest. Still, agency resolves the conflict credibly without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming/renewing the plaza’s identity) is clear, and tension accrues as he prepares and performs the ritual. The meaningful tightening arrives when the tessera is placed and the name is spoken, shifting the crowd’s felt reality. Still, overt cost or a foreclosed path is lightly sketched rather than dramatized. Pressure remains coherent but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightened by the dawn deadline and the visible strain of giving more of his essence. Escalation arrives via intensifying echoes, golden threads, and the coin revealing futures, culminating in a final bow. The cost (flicker, dissolution, coin fading) is clear and tied to agency. Pressure could sharpen with one concrete reversal or complicating beat, but it remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are coherent (devise a method to help victims, especially her brother) and signaled early, but pressure escalates smoothly without real friction or reversal. The meaningful tightening is the geode’s patterns resolving into neural‑network imagery that enables the protocol. Consequence is more promised than felt, and no option is truly foreclosed on the page. Tension is sustained but rarely sharpens into a painful trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are declared (understand the Great Hibernation; become its voice) but on‑page pressure is gentle. The key “turns” are discoveries rather than conflicts, and danger (cliff, rope, darkness) does not escalate or force a trade‑off. The acceptance of the fossil faces no resistance, price, or narrowed options. Escalation is more accumulative awe than tightening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes stay largely conceptual; pressure doesn’t tighten beyond a quiet puzzle. There’s a deepening (buttons correspond to echo patterns) but no on‑page reversal or cost that forecloses options. The spread to community arrives smoothly without friction. Tension is serene rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stakes are internal (purpose, protection of daughter) with a clear tightening: today’s more complex pattern and the key flourish concentrate decision. The choice to accept fractures and reassign the pillbox has consequence and forecloses the path of clinging to the old life. Cost is present but quiet; external antagonism is absent by design yet pressure coheres through the ritual deadline and thaw. Tension is sustained through cadence rather than reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—maintaining the boundary for safe passage—is clear, and the ticking gutters provide a modest tightening. Escalation remains gentle, more deepening than narrowing; no hard reversal or loss shifts tactics. The price paid is light, so tension never fully bites even as the ritual completes.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding and re‑vitalizing the oasis—tightens as phenomena respond (thrum, smoke portals, flowers, bees) and his actions start resolving timelines. Escalation is cumulative rather than confrontational, consistent with the lens. However, the felt price and narrowing of options remain gentle; there’s little risk or cost to test his commitment. The closing resolve offers poise more than a pressured trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—bringing light to darkness—tightens when the lantern is dying and when Jim reframes the act through legacy. Escalation is quiet but real: travel → discovery → responsibility → labor to dawn. The cost reads as time, effort, and acceptance of a duty rather than a hard trade‑off, so pressure feels gentle. Still, the encounter credibly forces stance crystallization under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (isolation vs. independence through coexistence) is signaled early. Escalation is gentle—today’s awakening is “particularly delicate,” the hum modulates pressure—but a decisive narrowing or trade‑off is soft. The final alignment is earned but not hard‑won on the page; there’s little visible price beyond conceptual renunciation. Tension operates more by cadence than contest.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering authentic voice) is signaled early and coherently pressured by the installation’s design and the nest encounter. Escalation reads as a density increase rather than a hard turn; the main tightening is the decision to write her own letter and to alter her practice. The felt cost remains light and internal, with little visible trade‑off beyond renouncing formula. A bolder foreclosed option or consequence would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are explicit (stop perception manipulation) and pressure tightens once with the risky activation and unstable surge. The reversal (signal blinks out) is earned by her agency. The on‑page price is modest; danger is anticipated more than paid, keeping escalation short of searing. Tension holds well at sentence and beat levels.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defy confinement to free her people—tightens via embodied resistance: pain, immobilization, and the unexpected portal to a different realm. The meaningful turn is the discovery that the “key” is passage, forcing a trade: known aim (surface) vs. unknown expanse. Pressure coheres and escalates without an antagonist; the cost is largely internal/opportunity, which keeps it short of the highest band. The act of stepping through cleanly resolves the immediate conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear (break an “unsolvable” case), and pressure increases when Reyes brings documents and the suspect pool narrows. Yet obstacles are low: access is immediate, deductions proceed smoothly, and no option is visibly foreclosed at cost. The climax is declarative rather than contested. Tension exists more as intellectual narrowing than lived jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (activate a risky, legacy system) is signaled early and tightens as decoding turns into action. The decisive press and initiation narrow options and test commitment. The cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page, so escalation feels measured rather than bracing. A single, clean tightening occurs but doesn’t foreclose a clearly named alternative with pain.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (whether to follow into the other dimension) is present and grows via the map’s intensifying language. Escalation is mostly atmospheric; opposition is soft, with little friction or trade-off tested on the page. The turning point is the decision to ascend, but the price is largely conceptual. Tension is elegant but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (resist takeover/save the venture vs. legacy) is legible, with one on-page pressure point (Marcus confrontation). The later bankruptcy provides consequence, but turns are summarized rather than faced in scene. Tension primarily deepens conceptually rather than narrowing options viscerally. The cost is clear though escalation feels gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are declared (recover lost healing wisdom), but on‑page pressure is low; discovery unfolds smoothly once dawn and collaboration arrive. The primary tightening is the shift from solitary struggle to shared decoding, which changes options but doesn’t foreclose a costly path. No antagonistic force or significant sacrifice challenges the protagonists after the reveal. As a result, tension lacks a felt price at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (free the mentor) is legible and tightens through the expanding circles and the choice to bleed. Escalation is steady rather than jagged; no major reversal, but the plant’s activation and ice consumption create a credible deepening. The price is present yet modest, keeping tension controlled rather than urgent. Resolution follows directly from her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (restore balance) is clear and tightens via the ritual and maze traversal. Pressure escalates through accumulative intensification (linking scars, pathways converging) rather than reversal; agency drives the turn. However, opposition remains largely abstract and the on‑page price paid is modest, tempering tension. The climax’s terror/exhilaration hints at cost without concretizing a loss.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: capture and return a rogue sorrow. Pressure rises with the specter’s approach and brief resistance, but the reversal is mild and resolution never forces a hard trade‑off in the moment. The cost is mostly legacy (bartered destiny) rather than an immediate sacrifice; escalation is adequate, not bracing. Agency drives the resolution, though at low difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes stay coherent: will he find meaning in this scrap and, by extension, in his diminished life. Escalation is subtle: from uncertainty to forensic focus to external challenge (“Worth anything?”) that forces value talk and stance crystallization. The narrowing is more conceptual than tactical, but it does tighten around a choice to authenticate with dignity. The price remains largely internal, keeping tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (to find/plant at the arbor) is legible, with pressure tightening from research to commitment (packing → boarding). Escalation is internal and cumulative; there’s no decisive external test, but the departure forecloses continued safety in scholarship. The cost is largely conceptual (leaving the mentor’s era, risking obsession), not an on‑page loss. Still, the stance crystallizes credibly at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—maintaining the Great Collection through an identity-binding ritual—is clear, and pressure tightens via the rising tide and the moment of standing still to undergo change. The escalation is textural rather than confrontational; the cost is acceptance of flux and periodic erasure of self. One meaningful deepening occurs when the librarian emerges “something entirely new.” Stakes feel a touch abstract, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure is mostly internal and accumulative; the decision to take and wear the crown is the sole tightening turn. Stakes are thematically high but on‑page risk remains soft; there’s little pushback or loss beyond implied burden. Still, the acceptance choice narrows her future path. Tension is present at image and beat scales, if gently.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early; pressure coheres as research becomes embodied risk (descending into tunnels) and culminates in the ritual act. The tightening is credible and protagonist‑driven; the price is emotional exposure without chemical buffer. Lack of an antagonistic force limits external tension, but internal stakes escalate convincingly. The final act forecloses avoidance as a path.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.5)
    One dominant stake—enter, learn, and record before disappearance—is signaled early and tightened by the watch’s accelerating reversal. The meaningful turn is the entrance and the later acceleration that forces triage to document. The cost is light (time pressure and the library’s receding) rather than a concrete forfeiture or moral trade. Tension is steady but rarely sharpens into a difficult sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake (preserve essence vs. imperial seizure) tightens after the tasseography reversal; options narrow to a risky propagation that will damage the original. Escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven, with a visible price paid. The off‑stage empire presence keeps pressure abstract, slightly softening the felt squeeze in-scene. Still, the decisive act and its consequence are unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve the essence before oblivion) is clear, but resistance is minimal and the process unfolds without a contested beat. The escalation is a density/rhythm lift (aurora strengthens, pattern clarifies) rather than a narrowing with cost. Completion feels inevitable rather than won. The personal wound is invoked but not tested on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are internal and coherent, but pressure escalates gently rather than tightening with a cost. The main deepening is at the central chamber and removal of the hairpin, which doesn’t foreclose a live option. No credible loss or hard trade‑off is dramatized on the page. The resolution is earned in tone, not through tested agency.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (justice vs mercy in a family breach) is clear, with the chime selection providing the single tightening beat. The price is internal: he maintains detachment to do his job. Escalation is quiet but present; the flicker in the shard hints at risk of opening, immediately curtailed. Stakes remain intimate and never spike beyond the advisory frame.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Maya attaining the paradox—tightens with the blindfold removal and the grotto’s emergence. Pressure is internal and coherent, culminating in Maya’s charged poise as she practices vanishing. The felt price is mostly conceptual; we get a concrete cost for Elien, less so for Maya. One more on‑page test of commitment would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake is focused and escalates through a single meaningful tightening: deciphering the birds’ pattern to the resonant pit and activating the arrowhead. Agency drives turns (choosing to follow the crows, to place the artifact, to encircle it with stones). The cost—his vanishing—lands, though interim resistance or jeopardy is minimal and the conflict remains largely internal and ceremonial. Still, the cadence shift near the end reweights the journey convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering non‑automated wonder—tightens meaningfully at the moment he unstraps the pack and commits. Pressure is coherent but largely internal; there’s no antagonist or irreversible external harm, keeping the cost conceptual rather than visceral. The escalation is nevertheless protagonist‑driven and reweights options. A sharper price or immediate repercussion would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are internal and signaled early—understanding the color of sound—and the pressure builds through the key’s heat and the compelled walk to the lighthouse. However, obstacles are minimal; doors open on first try and knowledge is bestowed rather than earned through tested resistance. The vow and indelible mark provide some cost and narrowing of future options. Escalation reads as deepening rather than tightening, adequate at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (humanity’s survival) is clear and present early; pressure tightens when “the contraction accelerates” and he must act now. Escalation is mostly procedural (filter → toss → read), with limited complication or trade-off. The reversal/turn comes from the spiral interpretation, but the price of being wrong is gestured at rather than felt. Resolution arises from his agency but without a concrete, on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (transmuting nameless grief/fear through naming) is clear. Pressure escalates via intensifying light and successive namings toward “Elara’s Eyes,” a cadence shift that tightens purpose. Cost is primarily internal and felt; no antagonist, but under the chosen lens the deepening suffices. A slightly sharper pinch or lost option would elevate the sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake (restore balance/life to the sea) is declared early and coheres. Escalation comes via the mage’s fixation on dripping rates culminating in a countdown and the on‑page assembly click. However, external resistance is light and the cost of commitment is mostly implied endurance rather than a sharper trade‑off. The tightening is real but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are coherent (truth vs. institutional narrative), and escalation proceeds through discovery to commitment. The tightening is meaningful when the aunt is recognized, reweighting his responsibility. However, antagonistic pressure remains largely offstage, and prices are implied more than felt. The ending’s agency is clear but lightly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early, but pressure scarcely tightens; the ritual proceeds without obstacle, reversal, or visible trade‑off. The flame’s shift to violet suggests nearing completion rather than escalation tied to risk. The birds’ cooperation removes friction rather than testing resolve. Resolution is earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting the community by correctly reading and communicating anomalies—is clear, with one meaningful tightening when the encrypted emergency protocol appears. Escalation is primarily internal and procedural rather than contested, keeping pressure coherent but soft. The final decision to transmit lands, yet the on‑page price is more implied than dramatized. A concrete foreclosed option or immediate consequence would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (awakening the duplicate before the rewrite erases them) is signaled early and tightens as the wave crescendos. The decisive move—Maya choosing to feel pain to fuel vivification—narrows options with a felt price. External antagonists remain conceptual, slightly softening the on‑page squeeze. Still, the pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (protect creative space vs. predictability) is articulated early but never faces a concrete on‑page test. The tightening comes via realization rather than pressure: the seed reweights her philosophy, and she commits to patience and unconventional care. No meaningful loss or foreclosed path is dramatized beyond stated intent. Tension remains low with little resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular: dissolve silence’s crust to reach lost laughter. Escalation tracks as intensifying texture and patterning—the controlled throttle builds a sound‑wash that culminates in the giggle and a post‑turn acceptance. The cost is internal (renunciation of restoration) rather than external, but it’s on the page and alters stance. Pressure is coherent though largely one‑directional, with limited option‑narrowing beyond the central ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transcending homesickness by embracing uncertainty—tightens as the pendant’s energy peaks and the guardian deliberately engages it. The meaningful turn is the intentional interiorization to dance with the magic and the final step out. Cost is implied (relinquishing the static refuge), but lacks a concrete loss or foreclosed option on the page. Tension is maintained but remains contemplative rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming the heirloom to interrupt destiny—is clear and tightens through successive failed trials. The “allow it to dissolve first” turn is a meaningful deepening that alters options. Cost is conceptual but felt; there’s no antagonist, yet internal risk and family legacy pressure suffice at this length. Escalation remains coherent without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—attune the fragment during a narrow window—is legible, and pressure tightens with the hush shard, perigee peak, and tower resonance. Escalation is steady but largely unopposed; there’s no reversal or real loss beyond shedding assumptions. The resolution feels earned by her agency, if somewhat low-risk. A stronger on-page price or near-miss would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are signaled early (merge timelines to heal fractures), but pressure scarcely tightens; the plan proceeds without meaningful opposition or trade‑off. The “Are you certain?” beat gestures at risk but doesn’t materially escalate options or cost. The decisive act (signal sequence) is agentive yet largely uncontested. Consequences are implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reaching/understanding connection) is clear, and pressure tightens when the threads act autonomously and visitors’ emotions erupt. Elias’s agency spikes at the touch, a credible escalation consistent with the lens. The price paid is largely internal and implied rather than sharply dramatized. No antagonist needed, but the tension remains largely atmospheric, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake is clear—bridge oceanic isolation with cosmic navigation—but escalation is mostly reportive. The key reversal (“breakthrough morning” when ships confirm) arrives via others, not Kael’s pressured choice. Skepticism is referenced without forcing a trade‑off or sacrifice. The final victory lacks an on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (protect the child) emerges and tightens via the hearing aid’s escalating pulse and the predator’s approach. Elena’s call to security is a clear, agency‑driven turn. Costs and tradeoffs are modest; danger remains mostly implied. Tension operates effectively at beat and story scales without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (guide the unremembered within one tide) is clear, and the clock tightens. Yet the path is largely unopposed; she succeeds with seven crossings without a snag, so pressure reads measured rather than acute. The claustrophobia provides ambient drag but no tactical shift. A single failure, price, or near‑miss would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (understanding the failure to reconfigure purpose) is signaled and addressed via the ritual, with one meaningful deepening when the defense mechanism misidentification is discerned. Pressure remains low; escalation is more density/insight than narrowing options. The price—acceptance of liminality and isolation—is felt but soft. A sharper on‑page trade‑off would increase torque.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reviving a dying language—remains focused and tightens with the unique bird pattern that catalyzes the breakthrough. Escalation is largely temporal endurance rather than on-page resistance; the meaningful turn is the pattern break leading to the diamond’s activation. The price (decades of work, last speakers gone) reads, though it’s more backdrop than live loss at the peak. Resolution is earned by his method and persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on secrecy and integrity versus exposure, but escalation is soft: the main tightening is a shift from capture to witness without a concrete on-page test or loss. The phone confidences and the arrowhead warming hint at pressure but do not force a decisive trade-off. Tension remains largely thematic rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (carry beauty back) and pressure coheres around the guarded passage and uprooting choice. The heart‑rhythm gambit supplies a credible narrowing, and the orchard’s “sigh” plus statues stirring adds consequence. However, risk is mostly controlled and outcomes consistently favor the protagonist; there’s little genuine loss beyond the shell dust and transgression. Tension works but rarely bites.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—execute a dangerous delivery—is signaled and tightened by the guards’ entrance; Elias adapts with cover behavior and dialogue. The risk is credible; his options narrow without melodrama. However, the scene resolves without a visible price beyond tension, limiting felt consequence. Still, the tightening is clean, coherent, and earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering a voice/self through risk—tightens as the chimes and fragment’s glow escalate pressure to sing. The decisive act forecloses a path (continued silence; keeping the fragment) and pays a price (the fragment dissolves, vulnerability embraced). Escalation is steady rather than harrowing, but coherent under an accumulative lens. A slightly clearer on‑page cost beyond the fragment’s loss would sharpen the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates via accumulative intensification—glow, vibrating words, the scarf’s unraveling—toward a single meaningful tightening. Stakes remain mostly internal and aesthetic; there’s no antagonist, but the price (losing the heirloom) sharpens the climax. The “patrons browsing” clock is atmospheric rather than pressing. Still, the core trade (artifact sacrificed for awakening) reads and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reconnecting with the sister/dream) is clear; pressure deepens when the strange book reframes tactics and when the images animate into a map. Escalation stays coherent with the accumulative lens, culminating in a reweighted goal rather than a decisive confrontation. The primary price is acceptance of transformation, not a hard trade‑off; tension remains mostly internal and lyrical. Still, the meaningful tightening (new method, revealed destination) gives the ending weight.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are legible (free the trapped idea) and the ritual provides a single meaningful tightening when he “falls” into the nexus. Yet opposition remains soft; the layers of doubt part without a concrete counterforce or setback. The price paid is conceptual rather than felt, which dampens escalation. Still, agency drives the turn and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming memory) is clear and tightens when the ring pulses and the seventh alignment triggers visions. The escalation is gentle and primarily knowledge‑driven; opposition is minimal, so the price feels conceptual more than dramatic. Agency is present in the comparison work and the deliberate touching sequence. A sharper on‑page cost or constraint would have deepened tension.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving/teaching resilience—tightens when the shadow activates the leaves and when the door creaks, testing Prisha’s steadiness. Agency is shown through endurance and attention rather than decisive external acts; her refusal to flinch functions as earned stasis. Costs are conceptual (accepting exile; risking error) rather than visceral, keeping pressure low. One clear deepening arrives via the “reversible exile” technique, but the conflict never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (preserving wonder), but pressure remains gentle; the ritual proceeds without substantive resistance. The tightening is a soft cadence shift (birds hush, water quiets) rather than a tested trade-off. The stated price (“give pieces of oneself”) does not manifest in a concrete loss or narrowed option on the page. As a result, escalation feels more ceremonial than risky.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: calming the spirits so the secret can be carried and spoken. Escalation is the deepening hush through successive knots, culminating in the decisive “final knot” turn. Agency drives the outcome; coincidence does not intervene. The price paid is largely tonal/psychic, not sharply dramatized as a loss, slightly softening the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure builds gently through accumulating data and the emergent pattern; the decisive tightening is the realization that the tear matches the constellation path. Stakes remain largely conceptual (how to honor silence), with a soft but credible price at the end. No antagonist is needed, yet the escalation is more contemplative than urgent. The final choice earns resolution without dramatic strain.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is internal—deciphering the last transmission to reframe grief—and it tightens through patterned attention to the globe and audio until the “home” turn. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price is acceptance and a new stance, not grand but credible at this length. Tension remains quiet but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (achieving communication/connection) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens; most beats are explanatory rather than escalatory. There’s no meaningful reversal or trade‑off—success arrives through discovered means without tested risk. The storm window hints at urgency but never bites. Resolution feels earned conceptually, not through on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering and ethically handling the captain’s truth—tightens with the clock of ascending floors and the mid‑scene inspiration at floor nine. The key turn is protagonist‑driven, and the ending forecloses disclosure with cost. Pressure remains gentle; no external counterforce tests her decision post‑revelation. Even so, the escalation reads coherent and sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: to witness and prove atmospheric memory while stranded. Pressure deepens when the cloud pattern echoes the mentor’s final day, tightening her resolve. Yet escalation is primarily contemplative; few options are foreclosed and on‑page cost remains soft. The turn is meaningful but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: complete a final piece before dawn. Escalation comes via the coin’s discovery, which deepens the goal, and the ticking clock that narrows options; the price is the building’s loss and the surrender of the initial literal concept. There’s no antagonist, but pressure coheres and tightens appropriately for this length and lens. The resolution grows from her agency rather than coincidence resolving the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (make a discovery) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens; no opposing force or meaningful risk tests resolve. The sole deepening comes when patterns click and the birds align; it’s informative, not costly. Agency exists in patient noting and decoding, but no option is foreclosed. The ending feels celebratory rather than hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are coherent (will he find and restore what matters), and there’s a clear tightening at the pedestal and the delicate lockwork. Yet obstacles are modest and largely aesthetic; he encounters no meaningful setback or tradeoff during the opening/repair. The price feels mostly conceptual, so tension never fully peaks. Escalation is present but mild.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (save the failing orchards) is clear, but pressure is stated rather than dramatized, and setbacks are referenced (“brambled hope”) without a beat testing resolve. The one major tightening is Aris’s thorough reexamination leading to the bell; after that, success proceeds smoothly. Costs (risk of trust, labor) are implied, not felt on the page. The result reads assured rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (forestall oblivion); escalation occurs as the clock shudders and he presses flaw to spindle, intensifying whispers. The tightening is clear and earned under the accumulative lens, with one decisive deepening. Cost lands as depletion and continued burden rather than a hard sacrifice. Stakes remain somewhat abstract, but the tactile beats keep them felt.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (save the travelers before frost) is clear, and pressure tightens with the ticking frost and the dead-end ledge. Agency drives each step, and the price (spent power) carries forward. Still, antagonistic force (birds) remains mostly atmospheric and never forces a hard adaptation beyond stealth. The result is strong but shy of a truly testing turn that forecloses a live option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal—repairing a sisterly bond—and signaled early, with one meaningful tightening at the foam‑pattern insight that leads to the atonement call. Escalation is quiet but coherent under an accumulative lens. Costs are implied more than dramatized; there’s little resistance on the call itself. Still, the renunciation of isolation reads and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake: open the shop under parole while seeking the origin of stories. Escalation is a single decisive tightening—the gathering of regret, longing, and hope to incise the symbol and form the door. The pressure remains coherent but low‑temperature; the price (no harming completed stories; limited parole) is noted more than felt. The customer’s arrival resolves without a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: do the work without being destroyed by contagious remorse. Escalation is achieved by the decision to enter, submit to the tide, and work within that force, with a visible price (trembling, strain). The path feels slightly smooth—no sharp reversal or lost option mid‑scene—so the tightening could be more pronounced. Still, agency, risk, and consequence are legible under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—healing a divided community—is clear, but pressure remains gentle and quickly cooperative. The “talks” reveal misconceptions and a useful detail (paint chips), yet no choice appears to foreclose a path or extract a visible price. Escalation is a smooth incline of successes rather than a tightening that forces a trade‑off. The end consolidates gains without testing commitment under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (access and transformation), and escalation follows activation to identity blur, but there’s no decisive on‑page trade‑off or foreclosed option beyond acceptance. Pressure coheres and deepens texturally rather than via turns. The cost is felt, yet conflict remains largely internal and unopposed. One meaningful tightening occurs, but without a hard reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (reactivating defenses before gravity returns) is clear and tracked by the hour. Escalation comes primarily from time pressure; puzzle difficulty and obstacles feel smoothed over. The one meaningful tightening—“exactly seven minutes” remaining—helps but arrives late and without a complicating turn. Consequences are implied more than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (recovering music) is signaled and deepens as Elara extracts emotions from the wood. Escalation arrives via density—sorrow to joy to a flood of feelings—rather than narrowing options. The cost is primarily emotional (tears, absorption of grief) and the tightening is modest. No reversal or external pressure tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—understand what the mountains demand before the phase—tightens credibly with the clock and intensifying pulses. The escalation is a density increase culminating in the “translate the silence” breakthrough. The price is mainly a reweighting rather than a concrete loss, so tension feels contained rather than acute. Agency drives the end, though the turn is more epiphany than hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (open/recover) is signaled early and escalates via layered resonance and a live clock. The tightening is a density increase that culminates in the click; agency drives it. The price is primarily conceptual (letting go of the old cataloging emphasis), not a hard trade‑off on the page. Tension remains steady more than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the seed’s nature and legacy—is clear, with one deepening turn at the opening’s blue filaments. Escalation is gentle; external pressure and hard trade‑offs are minimal, so tension remains low despite lyrical charge. The resolution stems from her attention and endurance but lacks a palpable price or foreclosed option on the page. A credible loss or risk paid in scene would strengthen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are signaled early (discover the source) and the hour-clock frames pressure, but opposition is light. The meaningful tightening comes at the First Arch, yet no hard trade-off or loss is demanded. The arrow’s reveal solves the mission without friction. Tension simmers more than compounds.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding the event—is clear, with one meaningful tightening when the tablet confirms irregularities and Elena moves toward the problem center. Pressure is primarily situational/accumulative rather than confrontational, and tangible costs or foreclosed options are light. The eerie silence and implied risk add tension, but no choice exacts a visible price. Escalation is present but conservative.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (“certify wonder”), and pressure accumulates as the composition progresses. However, escalation lacks genuine jeopardy or narrowing options; no obstacle complicates her method. The decisive beat (final chord) arrives as expected rather than earned against resistance. Cost remains diffuse and idealized.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (redeem failure by harvesting insight) tightens as the ritual shifts from a single note to glows/visions and a final relinquishment. Pressure is internal but escalates credibly via the ritual’s intensification and the confrontation with pride. The cost is largely emotional and conceptual; external stakes remain minimal, keeping the ceiling just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around extracting data by disorienting Thomas, escalating from ambiguity to panic to transfer completion. The ethical stake is clear but largely one‑sided—Elara faces little resistance beyond Thomas’s brief panic. The meaningful tightening is the activation of empathy and his fracturing calm. Costs register but remain mostly externalized.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is clear, but pressure rarely tightens beyond travel urgency. The shortcut beat is the one meaningful turn; little resistance tests commitment. The renunciation at the end provides cost, yet escalation lacks a hurdle that forces a trade-off on the page. Tension stays lyrical rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—prove the theory now or face being wrong—arrives early and deepens as images escalate from emotions to memories. The pivotal tightening is her certainty wavering, forcing a redefinition of the aim. Pressure remains internal, so the cost feels intellectual rather than embodied. Still, the beat progression is coherent and resolves from her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—carry the message to break the silence—is signaled early and tightened via the puzzle’s sacrifice mechanic, which narrows options with a clear price. The mid‑story turn (walking the glowing pieces, memory for footing) credibly escalates pressure. The final activation is earned by prior costs and restores the world’s sound with consequence. A touch more on the risk of failure in the last approach could heighten edge.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (repurposing destruction to prevent collapse) is present, but pressure rarely tightens in scene. The decisive act—accepting the bargain—faces minimal on‑page opposition, and later success repairing arches arrives without a turn that forces a painful trade‑off. Cost remains abstract; escalation is more declarative than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is consistent, and pressure coheres around attempts to access withheld knowledge. The major tightening arrives when the shard heats to block the red shard and later when the dream‑door fades—both foreclose options and signal cost. However, escalation often occurs via summary of journeys rather than in-scene choices, moderating intensity. The final stance (try again tomorrow) is earned endurance but not a leap in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (light’s reliability and the keeper fellowship), with one meaningful tightening when the lamp dies and forces investigation that uncovers the chain. Escalation is primarily internal/deepening rather than adversarial; the external hazard resolves swiftly after repair. The ending choice—to protect the lineage—carries a felt price in secrecy and duty. A touch more friction during the outage would sharpen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—safely guiding a refugee fleet—tightens when she opts to reveal the hidden channel. Agency is present and drives outcome; coincidence (twin comets) is flavor, not resolution. The legible cost is light: risk and responsibility rather than a concrete loss or foreclosed option. Escalation is clean but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are internal and concept-driven; pressure escalates by density: observation → experiment → discovery. The meaningful tightening occurs when he applies dye knowledge and formulates the mixture at a precise time with specific prisms. However, there is limited risk or loss if he fails, so the cost curve remains modest. Resolution is earned but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (understanding sorrow to preserve the labyrinth) is signaled early and deepens through the resonance event. Escalation is a density uptick (storm → pin chime → sextant flare) rather than a narrowing of options, apt for the chosen lens. Agency exists in the alignments and cataloging, but the catalytic chime leans on coincidence and the price is gentle. The final stance is earned yet low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are articulated early and the cadence tightens (song grows, walls pulse, urgency quickens). However, pressure is largely unopposed; no meaningful trade‑off or foreclosed option is dramatized beyond implied memory‑thread cost. The resolution feels inevitable rather than tested. A single concrete complication would sharpen escalation and price.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (connection vs. solitude) is signaled early and tightens as midnight nears and voices gather below. The decisive act—writing and delivering the note—forecloses a path. Escalation is modest and internal, yet coherent under a situational lens. The price (ongoing solitude and self‑acknowledged separation) is present but underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is internal: whether she will face and voice the truth and accept its implications. Escalation is soft but present—the tea ritual and rain lead to the decision to read the final letter and reframe her guilt. Cost is emotional (absolution vs. lingering guilt) and reflected in relinquishing the remaining bread. Lack of external pressure keeps stakes quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (preserve vows before they fade) is clear, and the sampler’s results deepen options. Pressure remains gentle; there’s little narrowing of options or on-page price paid beyond time and painstaking effort. The turn—discovering some vows can be reinforced—is earned but low-friction. Tension is steady rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear and tighten under time pressure, with a meaningful deepening at the final lie that forces Malachi’s revealing action. Agency drives the turns; coincidence doesn’t rescue her. The cost registers (she breaks the truce and risks violence), but her personal jeopardy feels limited as she slips away quickly. One more on‑page consequence to her body or social standing would raise the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—accepting or refusing carrierhood—is signaled early and tightens when the storm man arrives and the aurora flares. Escalation reads as a cadence intensification rather than sharp reversal, consistent with the accumulative lens. The cost is conceptual and identity‑level, not physical, and could be felt more viscerally at the choice moment. Nevertheless, the decision is protagonist‑driven and forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (recovering authentic creation) is signaled early, and the meaningful deepening comes when he decides to repaint Cora in the cave light. Pressure is largely internal; opposition from critics exists but is off‑stage and summarized, so escalation stays low‑friction. The price—abandoning external validation—lands but isn’t tested by a live counterforce. Still, agency drives the end and forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: reach the Repository to reclaim lost conversations and personal closure. Escalation tightens with the floorboard discovery and the lock‑and‑key realization, narrowing options toward a high‑risk, no‑deception path. The cost is stated (danger, social renunciation) but not stress‑tested in scene. One concrete on‑page obstacle or loss would deepen the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes—preserving wonder and communal harmony—are clear, but pressure seldom tightens; complications are minimal and mostly narrated away. The decisive intensification comes from inspiration and later the valedictory pulse, not from an escalating conflict with cost that narrows options. The result is beautiful but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—save the garden—intensifies coherently as the dome fails, forcing the trade-off of self for roses. The meaningful tightening is the shift to fragmentation and reallocation of life support, which forecloses the path of singular selfhood. Prices paid are legible (self-disassembly, original form inert) and consequences persist in the ending tableau. Tension is more lyrical than visceral, slightly softening moment-to-moment pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is gentle: curiosity → community recollection → key → letters. The dominant stake (prove listening heals/reconnect community) does not face a concrete obstacle; escalation is more accumulation than narrowing. The late key undercuts agency‑tested turns, and demolition notices never materially squeeze choices. Final cost is a soft renunciation rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake (unlock the lab’s knowledge) is clear, but pressure barely tightens—no credible obstacle or risk as she executes the dance. The single swell from “sequence begins” to “systems awaken” reads as an expected crescendo rather than a narrowing of options. No visible price is paid for success. The resolution is earned but too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens once when the dig uncovers the crystal; the sand’s resistance and abandoned authorities provide light external pressure. The key turn is her acceptance of visitation, not extraction, but the on‑page price feels gentle. Additional friction—time pressure, physical risk, or a moral trade‑off—would heighten stakes. As is, escalation is steady rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (hush the prophecy before dawn) are clear, and pressure accumulates through ritual intensification (wing glowing, coded words visible). Yet escalation stays largely internal and assured, with minimal narrowing of options or jeopardy. The “before dawn” clock appears but never bites, and there’s no reversal that tests commitment. Resolution feels earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure accrues softly through intimacy rather than opposition; the key tightening is the rooftop “interrogation” leading to Clara’s articulation of meaning and the kinship reveal. Stakes (identity/heritage vs. secrecy) remain largely conceptual and not viscerally tested. The lies add a faint social hazard but never pinch tactics on the page. The ending is earned but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stakes are clear (access/containment of memories; transformation of isolation), with an effective tightening at the dawn threshold and the crystals’ activation. Escalation deepens via revelation about the father and Elara’s assumption of guardianship. Pressure remains internal and lyrical, with little resistance beyond self‑contradiction, which modestly limits intensity. The cost is present but more solemn than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (redemption/restoration) is signaled early and coheres. The reveal of the decree tightens pressure and the blood signature marks a cost, but opposition is minimal and the magic key reduces struggle. Escalation is internal rather than confrontational yet still credible at this length. The resolution stems from his agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving balance—tightens when the echo is revealed as a growing child‑spirit and multiple forces “converge,” prompting a concrete tactic shift (from monitoring to soothing and offering choice). Pressure remains gentle; the threat reads more conceptual than felt, muting on‑page cost. Still, the offered choice is a credible, narrowing beat, and resolution stems from her agency. No coincidences resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (truth/justice vs. harm to living) is clear, but escalation is largely reported; the pressure seldom tightens on the page. The meaningful turn is Elara’s tactic to seed dreams in descendants, which leads to exposure by consensus; the cost is gentle and distributed. Lack of in-scene resistance or risk keeps tension moderate. The ending’s resolution feels earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (honoring hidden effort) is clear, but pressure barely tightens; conflict is largely contemplative. The significant deepening is the rain‑dependent journey and the final cadence shift at dawn. No major option is foreclosed beyond accepting solitude and ephemerality. Tension is present as a hum rather than a climb.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is legible (protect or expose the stillpoint), and the storm approaches to tighten the window. However, opposition is abstract; no concrete on‑page test forces a trade‑off beyond her internal vow. The final decision is sensible but low‑friction; cost is thematic rather than felt in scene. Tension is present but doesn’t crest into a true squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates via intensifying storms, growing clarity of transmissions, and the offstage rise of the prophet mirroring Elias’s work. The meaningful tightening is Elias’s acceptance of a non‑leader role despite the allure of authority—an endurance/renunciation with conceptual cost. Stakes remain abstract (truth vs. acclaim) and mostly offstage; no concrete beat forces a hard trade beyond vocation/recognition. Still, the internal conflict and chosen allegiance credibly resolve the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (reconnection across generations) is clear, but pressure remains gentle with minimal friction or trade-off. Escalation is a soft deepening rather than a narrowing of options; once the melody is captured, success faces no on-page challenge. Agency drives the turn, yet the price is modest and largely implied. Effective but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres as footsteps approach and the ritual begins. A single tightening beat (intruders in the tower; last light gone) moves us into the climax. The conflict resolves decisively but with minimal cost or complication; no meaningful trade‑off or loss alters tactics. Tension works, yet the path to victory feels low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (initiating the revolution via confirmation) is clear, with a single tightening at the zenith hum. However, there’s little on‑page price or foreclosed path; success does not force a trade‑off, and alternatives aren’t pressed. Tension is atmospheric rather than oppositional. Resolution is earned but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—truth vs. professional safety—and tightens as the note reframes the death into systemic negligence. The decisive deepening is Maya’s agency in opening the lantern and accepting career risk. Cost is stated rather than dramatized through on‑page pushback, keeping intensity just shy of peak. Still, the escalation reads as a clear because/therefore chain.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (whether to repair) is signaled early and tightens through revelation (origin of the heart, the ex-wife, the house purchase) toward a considered refusal. The “calm before realization” beat provides a palpable cadence shift. The cost is quieter than dramatic but reads: he chooses burden and reminder over restoration. Pressure is coherent though lightly scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—ring the unheard bell—is established early, but pressure escalates only lightly. The transliteration offers a functional middle turn, yet obstacles are minimal and tactics face little narrowing or cost. The ending decision is agentive but undertested. The piece reads more as quest-execution than conflict under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    One clear tightening: she chooses to lie, triggering a live clock and risk that culminate in alarms and exile. Stakes (truth vs. personal safety) are present and escalate without gimmicks. The cost is explicit enough to charge the ending. Slight softness in adversarial pushback mid‑breach keeps it short of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are signaled (storm, elders’ skepticism), and the ritual deepens intensity, but resistance is largely internal and soft. There’s no palpable reversal or narrowing—the crystal reconstitutes without a tangible setback or trade-off. Cost is limited to effort and minor physical sensation. Tension lives in cadence and imagery more than genuine jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (death vs. remaining) is legible, with a meaningful deepening when Marcus’s “fold in patience” challenges her forced timeline. Pressure is gentle and accumulative rather than sharply escalating; tension derives from stance crystallization, not reversals. The renunciation at the end reads earned, though the on-page price is more thematic than visceral. One clean tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes are internal: reclaiming purpose after heartbreak. Pressure deepens via patterned parallels (vines/seasonal hardship → human connection) and culminates in acceptance, but there’s minimal tightening or foreclosed option on the page. The cost—embracing distance and subtlety over grand gesture—is present yet soft. The piece maintains tension by cadence rather than turns.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is early (preserve echo before silence), and pressure builds texturally, but opposition is minimal and the ritual proceeds without a concrete test or narrowing choice. The most recognizable tightening is the moment of silence and parapet harmony, yet no option is foreclosed beyond the stated personal cost. Tension stays atmospheric rather than escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes center on whether disparate pains can cohere into shared understanding, yet pressure remains gentle and largely uncontested. Escalation occurs as the group participates and the arcs connect, but no option is foreclosed or made costly. The circle-formation resolves without a hard trade-off. Tension is lyrical rather than felt as narrowing choices.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is primarily internal and thematic; escalation occurs when the crystal emits a pure tone, deepening the stake from preservation to translation. Stakes remain somewhat abstract; there’s little visible price or narrowed option beyond reframing his role. The tightening is sufficient for this length but lacks a tangible loss or foreclosed path. Agency is present in his methodical testing and the final vow.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around locating the sound, with a meaningful deepening when the caretaker reframes the arch’s origin and the chalk completes the pattern. Stakes are intimate but clear, and the felt cost is the certainty of forgetting. Escalation is gentle rather than sharp, consistent with the chosen lens. The protagonist’s agency drives the turn (final spiral) that produces the hum.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (stabilize/understand the tremors; expand perception), with escalation via repeated tremors and failed attempts. The meaningful tightening is Elara rejecting force for resonance and restructuring perception filters. Costs remain largely conceptual; no concrete loss or foreclosed path beyond the philosophical pivot. Still, agency drives the resolution credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—crafting a flawless goodbye—is established early and tightened by the ticking clock (hours). Escalation is a controlled deepening (music soft → louder; son’s denial → bridge toward acceptance) rather than reversal. The visible price is Mr. Anders’ death and the family’s first moments without him. Agency is quiet but present in the therapist’s choices that foreclose alternate paths.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates as she approaches the final loop. The tightening is single but effective: completing the last connection risks unknown consequences and triggers revelation. However, there’s little on‑page price or foreclosed option—consequences feel more promised than paid. Tension operates more through accumulation than hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (recovering the authentic Arthur/aligning realms) is steady and escalates through the ritual to the figure’s arrival. The meaningful turn is the tooth’s activation leading to a liminal encounter and exchange. Pressure is lyrical rather than adversarial; the cost is primarily conceptual, so intensity feels slightly cushioned. Still, agency drives the deepening rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes (find a fireless way to share celestial wonder and reconcile with earthbound limits) are signaled and carried. Escalation is a gentle deepening: discovery that polished glass patterns surpass telescopic seeing, then the commitment to craft arrangements, culminating in communal pilgrimage. The tightening forecloses one path (space travel) in favor of another, though pressure is low and largely internal. No sharp reversal, but the cadence shift toward public purpose is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—release and ethical recommitment—and tightens toward the decisive offering. The escalation is quiet but clear: the spiral recognition → the guided spot → the proffering/placement. Cost (surrendering the pendant; accepting wounds as landscape) is on the page. The beat structure is soft‑edged yet functional for the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (art vs compromise), but escalation is gentle; pressure accrues via atmosphere rather than a sharp narrowing. The tightening is the decision to finalize the page and place the shell, but visible price is modest. No antagonist or reversal is needed, yet the tension stays mostly internal and low-heat. The cadence shift at the end suffices, though with limited cost signal.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is signaled early (restore practices before the harvest moon) and deepens with a time constraint. Escalation is mostly procedural and accumulative; resistance is light, with no meaningful reversal or hard trade‑off. The communal performance is a clean payoff but lacks a palpable price or narrowing of options under pressure. The result feels assured more than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (“when darkness threatened to consume all”), and pressure accumulates via ritual precarity and a live “one misstep” warning. Escalation reads as a cadence tightening rather than a hard narrowing of options. The final act (placing the flash‑paper) is protagonist‑driven but lands without a felt price paid. The threat remains conceptual, so the climax resolves smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the echo‑harvest—tightens via accumulating observations into calibrated reconstruction and the awakening thrum. Pressure remains internal and methodical; opposition is mainly time and uncertainty, with little on‑page risk or trade‑off. The turn (from mapping to activation) is earned and narrows options, but the price is soft. Tension is quiet yet steady.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (collecting and measuring burdens) tightens at the self‑burden and peaks with the ancient civilization’s calcification and vision. Escalation is textural rather than oppositional, but the need for precise alignment and the risk of mishandling their own burden create a credible squeeze. The price—enduring the calling reweighted as connection—reads. Tension remains modest but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent: contain what matters within the boil, continue living with loss by making. Pressure tightens via the kettle’s crescendo and the shift from tentative to confident cuts; the scream marks a peak beat. The price is quiet endurance and the foreclosed path of avoidance. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than decisively narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early, and pressure tightens via the active build: assembling story fragments, producing the word‑bridge, and risking the crossing. The decisive trade—surrendering the long‑sought wheel—registers as a price. Escalation is mostly linear and smooth; there’s little resistance or reversal once the device engages. Still, agency drives the peak, and the cost reweights the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (revive a system as an equation for hope), and there is one meaningful tightening at the moment of the switch throw. However, opposition is minimal: no credible obstacle, failure, or trade‑off tests the commitment. The price (time, solitude, risk) remains largely implied rather than dramatized. As a result, escalation feels smooth rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reconciling with a forsaken craft) tightens through the hum’s intensification and the bear’s charged witness, culminating in the risky offering. The offering forecloses a safe, regret‑bound path and commits him to action. Pressure coheres without needing an antagonist; escalation is modest but unmistakable. Cost is felt, if quiet, at the pocket‑watch beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (salvage truth vs. deception), and the piece tightens when she finds and decodes the journal. Escalation is mostly informational; no counter‑force or irreversible price tests her commitment. The final stance is earned but low‑friction, keeping the tension mid‑tier.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (access to the weavers’ knowledge) is clear, and pressure coheres through a single deepening: the long, silent decoding that finally earns trust. Escalation is modest; there’s little risk beyond time and discomfort, and no real narrowing of options. The fisherman’s turn is earned, but stakes remain contemplative rather than pressing. A sharper trade‑off or concrete loss would strengthen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is internal: can he move from writing others’ obituaries to confronting his own absence. Pressure coheres and tightens via a meaningful deepening (from gardener’s elegy to self‑reckoning). The felt price is vulnerability and relinquishing a protective tactic. Escalation is quiet but clear under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: restore beauty. Escalation is coherent under a causal lens—completion of the device tightens options; the transient success then reverses, forcing a stance. The emotional cost is legible in the collapse and the vow to dismantle society’s foundations. External antagonism is minimal, but internal and situational pressure suffice at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (save the grafted roses) is clear; the meaningful tightening arrives when embers land and she shields the plants. Her agency drives protection rather than retreat, lightly defying the evacuation order. However, reversals and visible costs are minimal and success comes without a hard trade‑off. Tension operates but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (liberate memories/restore city) is clear, and there is one meaningful tightening (empty pedestal → starlight key → window). Yet pressure rarely bites: no credible failure risk, moral tradeoff, or antagonist forces adaptation beyond patience and insight. The resolution requires little sacrifice beyond identity shift, so escalation feels soft. Effective but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (deliver light without fire) is signaled and pursued, but pressure seldom tightens; success arrives without credible resistance. The sonar’s intensification and “gear slowing” hint at a pinch but never force a trade-off. No on-page reversal or credible price beyond reflective melancholy. The piece reads as assured completion rather than tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (rendering collective grief) is clear, and pressure accumulates via ritual, migration, and the ribbon’s depletion. Escalation is more deepening than tightening; few real options close besides time and resource use. The retracing choice provides a mid‑story intensification but not a sharp reversal. The price is mostly conceptual/ritual rather than a hard trade-off under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (restore the clock/community trust) is clear early, and tightening occurs when the solution shifts from solitary labor to collective action. The legible cost is Alaric’s surrender of control/status; however, external resistance is minimal, making the path feel relatively unopposed. The escalation is more deepening than pressurizing, but it coheres. The final lift of the bob supplies a concrete peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unraveling intentions—tightens with the hum and the emergent woman image, culminating in the sacrificial reveal. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than narrowing options; it’s coherent under the chosen lens. The price is internal (foreclosing disclosure, recalibrating belief) rather than contested on the page, keeping tension quiet. Still, the final renunciation (returning the tapestry, waiting another month) is an earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are singular and clear (timely map to avert spring danger), yet escalation remains mostly declared. The only on‑page tightening is noticing cracks that align with predictions; no option is truly foreclosed or traded at cost. Internal and external pressures align but never clash to force a morally sharp choice. Resolution follows intention without testing it.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clear (defying the Narrative Control Bureau), but on‑page pressure is low; no complication or near‑discovery tightens her choices mid‑scene. The meaningful turn is mostly the start/finish of the broadcast, with cost implied rather than dramatized. The “cloaking” tactic is smart but meets no active resistance in the moment. Resolution is an endurance stance rather than a tested trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are primarily internal: whether completion offers safety or whether process must be embraced. Escalation reads as a cadence shift (chair slowing/stopping; finishing touches; display), not as a hard trade‑off with visible external price. The cost is conceptual and emotional, credible for the mode, but pressure remains relatively low. One meaningful tightening occurs, but no path is sharply foreclosed beyond a philosophical renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (preserve vs. destroy/forget) is clear, but escalation is modest: the discovery prompts reflection rather than a sharpened external threat. The Council’s impending destruction is offstage, so pressure remains conceptual. The final choice forecloses a path (compliance) but the on-page price is muted. One tightening occurs (find → decision), yet no real reversal or cost lands in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are declared (preserve arts/unite divided singers) but rarely tested on the page; conflict and escalation are largely reported as already mitigated by her method. The key tightening is the eventual handoff—endurance giving way to succession—but it lacks a pressured decision beat. Tension remains gentle and thematic rather than scene‑driven. The cost is credible but softened by summary.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is coherent: act now, under alignment, to seed a different future. Escalation arrives as the celestial peak and the tactile decision to plant; pruning functions as preparation and metaphor. The pressure is gentle rather than testing—few options are truly narrowed beyond “now or not now,” and the price is modest. The piece earns a quiet tightening but never bites down on a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear (access and restore systems; moral lens on wonder), and pressure tightens with the move from booth to transformer to chamber. However, obstacles yield easily: authorization is granted swiftly, and the supervisor offers little resistance. The decisive turns are mostly revelations rather than contested actions, which keeps the cost felt but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—understanding—and tightens at the placement-and-glow sequence. Escalation is primarily deepening rather than conflict; the shard’s activation changes knowledge but the price is understated. Agency is present in the ritual method and targeted choice of the lighthouse. The cadence shift is clear, though stakes remain contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are internal—can the diver release certainty to gain access to deeper truth—and escalate with the ampoule’s opening. The tightening is clear but gentle; tension is more contemplative than urgent. Agency is present (acceptance and opening), though the price is low-friction on the page. No antagonist or sharp reversal limits peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (break the loop to reclaim choice), and pressure coheres through the discovery of a fracture point. The decisive tightening is the calculated placement of the chipped die and activation of the proof. Escalation is primarily intellectual, with limited complicating reversals or on‑page costs before success. The end choice at the bar is an earned follow-through rather than a new pressure spike.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is internal: can she make forgotten kindness legible for strangers. Escalation arrives via intensifying daydreams and the waxing moon, but there’s no concrete reversal or narrowed option that forces a trade‑off. The price—sleep, solitude, obsessive focus—is felt but modest. Resolution is an endurance stance rather than a pressure-tested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reviving a dying culture—is clear, and pressure coheres around the beekeeper’s absence and the failing rituals. Escalation arrives when the guide reframes the lens’s use, tightening tactics and producing the thaw. The price is primarily emotional and communal, not a foreclosed option or sacrifice on the page. No antagonist, but tension holds through the procedural ritual and fragile hope.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (unlocking the stone before the tide returns) is signaled early and tightens through resistance and time pressure. The key escalation is Esme’s counter‑spin choice, which narrows options to a single commitment. Consequences are sweeping but largely abstract on the page; no immediate sacrifice or loss is shown. Tension is steady rather than knife‑edged.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (reshape relation to death/fear) is signaled early and intensifies through the paradox‑reading and mirror confrontation. The key tightening is the recognition of fear’s nature and the advisor’s identity, which forces a renunciation of the old stance. Resolution results from the protagonist’s deliberate surrender (touching the clasp, “unbosoming”). Prices are implied rather than dramatized through loss, keeping tension modestly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on the community’s safety; pressure coheres around the violent cloud formation. The tightening comes when she opts for complex resonance over ordinary warning, which reweights options and appears to redirect the storm. However, on‑page cost is muted (securing efforts are offstage; no immediate loss). Escalation is clean but restrained.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates coherently from quiet obsession to a triggered response and revelation, culminating in a renunciation that narrows options. Stakes remain largely conceptual (ancient evil, guardianship) and offstage, so the felt risk is modest in-scene. The “crack” is a strong tightening turn; the price is Kael’s pivot from seeking escape/answers to bearing duty. One concrete on-page risk or loss would lift the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are singular—recover the suppressed truth—and escalation is a steady deepening of evidence rather than a hard reversal. The decisive tightening comes with the hidden ledger, but on-page cost or resistance is light. Pressure coheres under the causal lens yet remains largely investigative rather than combative. Effective, if low-simmer.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (honoring and documenting lost human textures) escalates through the discovery and retrieval of the metal box. The “wrest” beat is the single tightening turn; after that, pressure settles into ritual, with limited additional cost. Stakes are largely internal and aesthetic rather than contested by an active counterforce. Earned but gentle escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on identity and vocational purpose; pressure tightens with the sigil coincidence and the confirmation materials. The decisive deepening is the hypothesis becoming “undeniable truth.” Still, prices are largely conceptual; no option is materially foreclosed on the page besides a reorientation of belief. The blackout complicates but never truly corners him.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates through completion of the lantern and the committed act of surrendering it to the vault. The cost is legible (relinquishing the last dream, tears), and agency drives the turn. There’s no reversal or external pressure, but the accumulative cadence tightens credibly. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential for the protagonist’s forward path.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (reach, harvest, get out before shields return), but pressure never tightens on the page—no complication, reversal, or trade‑off. The window constraint informs timing without producing a felt squeeze. The “largest pool ever” promises risk yet resolves without friction, muting escalation. Closure is earned by completion rather than tested commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is established quickly and maintained: achieve resonance/decoding. Pressure tightens through interference, the mechanism awakening, and the convergence choreography; the “pull sequence” is a credible culmination. However, visible price or foreclosed option is minimal; no genuine trade‑off or loss complicates the win. Tension operates but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure is primarily internal but coherent and tightening: the nightly sifting culminates in the grandfather’s carving, deepening stakes from guilt to irrevocable recognition. The price is a renunciation—closing the lucrative business—which forecloses a path. Escalation is quiet yet legible under the accumulative lens. A more direct external test could have pushed the cost higher.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around the meeting’s delicacy and the ritualized timing; the meaningful tightening is the placement of the pull in moonlight leading to apology. The cost is primarily emotional; no hard trade‑off is dramatized beyond letting go. Stakes remain focused and resolved by protagonist agency (her method and stance). Lack of a sharper reversal or loss keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—self‑forgiveness/identity—is clear, and pressure coheres through the day’s bad news and her ritual. The meaningful tightening arrives when the dolphins catalyze a revaluation of symbols and path. Costs are mostly conceptual/emotional and convincing but gentle; little is foreclosed on the page beyond accepting the withdrawn offer. A concrete trade‑off in‑scene would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake is largely internal and abstract; escalation is mild. The tunnel selection and meeting the younger self provide a single deepening, but there is little resistance or trade‑off on the page. Consequences are asserted more than felt. The loop acceptance could carry more visible price to sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early; pressure tightens through the metamorphosis and the dwindling power of the spices. The main reversal/deepening is the ephemeral reunion and the forced letting go when the connection fades. Cost is primarily emotional rather than tactical, but legible; the piece avoids reset. The conflict could sharpen with one more concrete trade-off on the page, yet it still escalates coherently under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is internal (control vs presence) and is signaled early. Escalation arrives via the ritual deepening (shimmering memories, sudden wind, dissolving glade) and culminates in her accepting limitation. The price is conceptual/emotional rather than visceral; options narrow, but gently. A sharper on‑page tradeoff or visible loss would intensify pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are singular and legible: open the locked dimension or fail and be trapped in the void. Pressure tightens through the stitching sequence with the “one wrong stitch” risk and the body’s lightness rising as hope blooms. However, there’s minimal reversal or adaptation; the path from intent to success is steady, with limited cost testing their commitment. The final crossing is earned but not harrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure tightens once: the detour leads to the prophesied encounter and the climactic release. Stakes remain largely internal, and conflict is low-friction; few options are foreclosed beyond the sentimental cost of surrendering the collection. The cadence shift at alignment peak is effective but gentle. Earned, but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are coherent (covert communication vs. surveillance), but escalation is soft: the “Keeper summons” adds a ripple, not a squeeze. Options don’t notably narrow; no meaningful price is exacted on the page. The ending resolves to quiet success without a turn that forecloses a live path. Tension holds, but never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (restore balance/understand patterns) is clear and escalates through the ritual culminating in eruption. The meaningful turn is the realization that harmony, not control, resolves the pressure. Prices are more implied than dramatized: danger is mentioned, but the scene rarely corners her with a hard trade-off. Tension holds but never bites down hard.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (to speak truth under suppression) is clear, and the live clock (mask‑slip window) supplies the key tightening. Escalation is felt via the timer’s cadence and the shift from contemplation to writing to outward gaze. However, external pressure never presses back on the page, so cost and narrowing remain largely internal. The resolution is credible but not hard‑won in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—decode the overture while waiting—never tightens into a hard trade-off or visible cost. The coordinate reveal is a success beat without reversal, and the intellectual sparring is illustrative rather than pressurized. Pressure does not meaningfully narrow options; the attendant’s call simply ends the scene. As a result, stakes remain mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving/protecting knowledge through beauty—stays coherent and deepens via the reveal of seeds and banned words. Escalation is tonal and textural rather than confrontational, with one meaningful tightening as present resistance shifts from curation to planting. The cost is present but mostly conceptual; no live counterforce presses a concrete trade‑off. Still, the cadence shift near the end effectively narrows the stance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (beat the shutdown to access temporal refuge) is clear and tightens with the deepening sky and failing infrastructure. The decisive move—entering the projected liminal section—comes from his agency and prior preparation. However, the price of that choice isn’t made concrete on the page (e.g., danger of not returning or cost paid to get through), softening escalation’s bite. Tension is steady rather than spiking.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are singular and clear, and pressure coheres under the ticking monsoon and ritual attempt. Escalation is present but gentle; resistance is largely internal and the ritual succeeds without visible setback or trade‑off. The meaningful tightening occurs with entering the cave and beginning the song as the stones resonate. A sharper obstacle or loss would heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reconciliation/revelation) is signaled early and tightens when the lace shows a new sequence and he admits what he withheld. The needle’s widening circles to a heart‑pointing glow register an escalation consistent with the accumulative design. Emotional price is paid through confession and surrender to the ritual’s demand. Pressure is gentle, but it grows coherently to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elena’s search for purpose—is clear, and the internal conflict between her past and present focus accumulates pressure effectively under the textural lens. The resolution is earned, with the cost being her former identity. The escalation is subtle, a deepening of perspective rather than a tightening of external threats, which fits the story's mode.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—survival and truth—is established early and the discovery provides a meaningful tightening of the conflict. However, the escalation lacks force because the protagonist's agency is diluted. The frost patterns feel more like a message being delivered *to* her than a truth she actively uncovers through struggle, which lessens the tension of the core discovery beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story signals a powerful stake—rectifying a global silence and personal trauma—but the on-page conflict lacks pressure. Elena's experiment proceeds without any obstacle, doubt, or complication. There is no escalation or meaningful turn that forces a difficult choice; success is achieved on the first attempt, which deflates the tension and makes the resolution feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's search for meaning beyond the finality of death—is signaled early and effectively. The pressure escalates when he realizes his purpose is not merely to explore but to "revitalize" the library, a choice driven by his own agency. The resolution is earned, and the cost is his former life. The external conflicts (currents, ghosts) are presented as potential threats but are overcome too easily to generate significant tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story effectively establishes the dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—and escalates the pressure through a single, meaningful tightening via Mira's report. Elias's final declaration is a clear, agency-driven response that alters the community's tactics. The cost is legible: they are trading the relative safety of anonymity for a more defiant, and thus more vulnerable, form of collective action.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—finding peace by understanding unused love—is internal and compelling. The conflict deepens effectively through the mystical experience, which forces a confrontation with past-life emotions. The resolution feels earned within the story's spiritual framework, and the cost is legible in the release of tears and the dissolution of the pearl, foreclosing the need for a continued search.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's grasp on reality versus her obsessive quest for knowledge—is established early and escalates effectively. The initial experience creates a threat, and the second shard deepens it into a choice. Elara's agency in the final act is decisive, and the cost of her choice is made visceral and unmistakable in the final lines, creating a powerful resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake and executes a single, effective escalation when the demolition crew arrives early, forcing a trade-off with a legible cost (the loss of the remaining seeds). However, the central conflict—solving the vault's lock—lacks tension because the solution is immediate and requires no struggle, weakening the overall pressure until the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake, intensified by the character's mortality. However, the final resolution lacks a visible price or trade-off, which deflates the accumulated tension. Kael achieves his goal and receives a bonus insight into healing without a final, costly act of renunciation or choice, making the conflict feel resolved by convenience rather than by a difficult, character-driven decision.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant existential stake—understanding her destiny—is compelling. However, the on-page conflict during the heist lacks significant tension; the stationmaster is a passive obstacle. The escalation is primarily internal and conceptual, a deepening of knowledge in the final scene rather than a tightening of external pressures. The cost is legible but purely conceptual, missing a visceral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—Elias’s need to “thaw” his grief—is signaled early and remains the clear focus. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively through the deliberate, meditative process of glassblowing, with each narrated step intensifying the core metaphor. The resolution is earned not through a single confrontation but through a sustained act of creative endurance, with a cost that is felt in the memory of his "darkest emotional winter."

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—survival and the claiming of a true identity—is established early and escalated effectively. The pressure tightens from the internal threat of her phobias to the external, time-sensitive task of decryption, culminating in the physical arrival of her hunters. The final turn, where she chooses a new tactic (vulnerability) based on her internal shift, is driven by protagonist agency and has a clear, immediate cost: facing imminent danger.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes (survival of a people) are high and the conflict is compellingly internal. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation is handled expertly through the deepening crisis of the fading star, which forces a stance crystallization. The oracle's agency in choosing to map the darkness rather than fight it is a powerful turn, and the cost—accepting a world without light—is made unmistakably clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The primary stake—existential self-discovery—is established early and effectively deepened when the robot touches the violin, revealing the temporal consequences. The pressure builds from a quiet internal conflict (protocol vs. curiosity) to a high-stakes choice involving reality itself. The protagonist's agency in choosing to play the instrument drives the resolution, and the cost (the dissolution of its former, stable self) is made clear, resulting in an earned climax.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—overcoming mistrust in a silent world—is signaled early and effectively escalated. The discovery of the lens room raises the stakes from personal insight to societal power, forcing a meaningful climactic choice. Elara's renunciation of this power is an earned turn with a clear, legible cost: she must now do the slow, hard work of building trust. The pressure builds coherently to a satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is primarily philosophical but is grounded effectively through the impending visit of the scientists. The stake—proving the garden's unquantifiable nature—is clear and consistently held. The placement of the cereus-patterned marble serves as a meaningful tightening, an act of defiance that reifies his stance. The cost is his acceptance of a victory that can never be validated by the outside world.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the central stake—proving a revolutionary theory—is clearly established, the conflict lacks meaningful pressure. The experiment proceeds as a smooth, successful procedure without setbacks, opposition, or a credible threat of failure. This absence of struggle makes the final triumph feel predetermined and diminishes the narrative tension, rendering the stakes purely intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—completing the ghost's unfinished performance to resolve a spiritual dissonance—is established early and effectively. The pressure deepens texturally, moving from exploration to discovery to the decisive act of performance. The final choice to play the music resolves the conflict with a felt cost (the program's dissolution), earning the final peace. The conflict is primarily atmospheric and internal, which aligns perfectly with the story's chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake—the need to find the "weight of a swallowed truth"—and successfully deepens it into an external quest. The pressure escalates through a single, meaningful turn: the discovery of the coordinates, which transforms a vague obsession into a concrete mission. The final choice to venture out into the cold demonstrates a clear acceptance of the cost, making the resolution feel earned and weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—finding the "swallowed truth"—is established early and pursued consistently. The radio confession provides a single, effective tightening of pressure that leads directly to the climax. The protagonist's agency lies in his choice to surrender to the experience, and the resolution has a legible, internal cost: the acknowledgment of his own unspoken truths.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, potent internal stake: the keeper's commitment to witnessing change versus the allure of regenerative stasis. The pressure deepens decisively when the keeper enters the silent pocket, moving from a conceptual mission to a tangible temptation. The keeper's agency is demonstrated in the choice to leave, paying the cost of returning to entropy. This is a focused and successful handling of a subtle, high-concept conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—breaking through Lila's silence—is established early and pursued with focus. The escalation under an accumulative lens is well-handled, moving from a flicker of interest to tentative drumming to a confident rhythm. The final breakthrough feels earned, with the cost captured effectively in Maya's realization of the moment's fragility ("like a newly opened flower that might close again").

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict—the historian's work against the fading of memory—is compelling and well-defined. The discovery of the tapestry and diaries provides a single, meaningful deepening of the stakes, shifting the goal from mere preservation to understanding a cosmic tragedy. The resolution is an Earned Stasis, a crystallization of purpose rather than a victory over the quiet. The cost is the profound, now fully understood, separation of humanity from its mythic past.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—whether the writer can shift humanity's perception—is conceptual but clear. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens effectively when the letters confirm the success of his work, solidifying his resolve. The cost of his mission (isolation) is implicit and felt, but the story lacks a moment of acute, on-page tightening where a path is decisively foreclosed or a tangible price is paid in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake is established early and the conflict escalates logically, with the priest's paradoxical question serving as a meaningful tightening of pressure. However, the antagonistic force capitulates somewhat easily to the rhetorical trap, making the priest's victory feel more intellectual than hard-won. The lack of a significant price paid for this victory keeps the tension from reaching its highest potential.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal conflict is clear, compelling, and skillfully escalated. The dominant stake—to conduct the symphony before exhaustion hits—is established early and provides a relentless source of tension. The pressure deepens as memories intensify and energy wanes, leading to a climax where the character achieves his goal at a high, visible price, making the resolution feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—to understand his true nature—is signaled early and effectively drives the narrative. Pressure escalates appropriately for an Accumulative structure as Elias moves deeper into the fractures, with the visions of alternate selves raising the personal stakes. The resolution, a stance crystallization, is earned by his agency in undertaking the journey, and the cost is the burden and wisdom of his new self-knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—overcoming emotional numbness—is established immediately and escalates effectively. The conflict deepens from a private, internal struggle to a shared, artistic expression that redefines her purpose. Eleanor's agency drives every significant turn, and the final resolution is a direct result of her choices, with the cost of her deafness being recontextualized rather than erased. The stakes feel personal and potent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—personal safety versus the zone's liberation—is clear, and the discovery of the message provides a single, meaningful tightening of pressure. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency. The primary weakness is that the cost of the final choice remains abstract and intellectual, lacking an on-page moment of sacrifice or a palpable sense of loss that would sharpen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—understanding and integrating grief—is established early and tested throughout the central scene. The pressure deepens effectively as the ultraviolet light reveals successive layers of painful memory, forcing a confrontation. The resolution is an act of agency (embracing grief rather than fighting it) that has a clear, felt cost, making the final stasis earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively establishes a high-stakes conceptual conflict: to understand a new reality or remain lost. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the escalation works well, with the growing complexity of the rope pattern representing a meaningful deepening of the stakes. The final realization is an earned resolution that crystallizes the cost—a permanent, paradigm-shifting change in perception.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding music in the silence—is clear, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation. Pressure remains constant rather than intensifying; Kael's discoveries progress smoothly without significant setbacks or trade-offs. The resolution is achieved through a sudden insight rather than a choice made under duress, which diminishes the feeling of a hard-won victory.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes a clear professional stake—the successful transformation of the client—but fails to dramatize any meaningful conflict. The process is depicted as smooth and frictionless, even during the "most critical part." The absence of any obstacle, resistance, or complication means there is no escalation of pressure, leaving the story feeling more like a static portrait of competence than a narrative with tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The conflict is minimal and lacks significant pressure or escalation. While the story's focus is on connection, the stakes—Eleanor's unfunded project—are resolved too easily through Elias's intervention without any dramatized obstacles, trade-offs, or complications. The path from problem to solution is a straight line, which undercuts narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story effectively translates the internal stake of loneliness into an external, physical quest with tangible risks. The pressure escalates from personal yearning to the shared dangers of the search, culminating in a resolution earned through collective effort. The cost is legible as the transformation of "luminescent ache" into belonging, a satisfying if not particularly surprising trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes are established early, escalated effectively through the ticking clock of the waking giant, and resolved via a high-agency choice with an unmistakable cost. The protagonist's final, desperate act of borrowing from his entire future provides a powerful and earned climax. The pressure is coherent, grows consistently under the causal lens, and pays off with a visceral, legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—resolving the ambiguous loss of her mentor—is clear from the outset. The conflict is primarily internal, escalating as the ritual deepens and time seems to bend, culminating in a turn that deepens her knowledge rather than resolving the external problem. This shift provides a new path, reweighting the stakes from aimless searching to focused inquiry, with the clear cost of investing in a potentially fragile hope.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central conflict between the dweller's desire to help and the necessity of remaining hidden is established early and effectively tightened. The discovery of the tape fragment escalates the stakes from a general principle to a specific, urgent crisis that only they can solve. The final decision carries a legible cost—the profound risk of intervention—making the resolution feel earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—Elara's entire professional philosophy of control—is established early and tested consistently. The pressure escalates effectively through the storms and anomalous plant growth. Her climactic choice to "release control" is a meaningful turn with a visible on-page cost, earning the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Lena’s internal struggle for purpose against trauma—is well-established and compelling. The exchange of the brooch for the pigments provides a single, decisive tightening. The cost is clear and felt: she gives up a personal comfort object, her “talisman against her sleepless nights,” for a larger artistic and communal purpose, making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story signals the core stake—Elara's reliance on predictable foresight—and escalates pressure effectively through the steadily encroaching magical phenomena. The tightening is excellent, occurring when the first shadow detaches, forcing her to confront a reality beyond her control. Her agency is demonstrated in the choice to accept and participate rather than resist, and the cost—the forfeiture of her old identity—is legible and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the community's ability to heal and reclaim its history—is signaled early and effectively deepened. The revelation about the herald provides a meaningful turn, shifting the emotional calculus from loss to sacrifice and possibility, thereby reweighting the stakes. The cost is legible in the sorrow that precedes peace, and Elina's agency in uncovering and sharing this truth drives the resolution. The escalation is emotional and textural, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the mystery—escalates effectively into a life's purpose. However, the conflict lacks sharp pressure; Ethan is invited and guided rather than opposed. The "dare" to his analytical nature is accepted with minimal struggle, softening the tension that should precede his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—achieving connection by understanding the tile—is clear. Pressure deepens effectively once when Elara witnesses "memories of solitude and disconnection," forcing her to act and open the tower to others. While this meets the requirement for a single meaningful shift at this length, the conflict remains entirely internal and lacks significant opposition or complication, keeping the overall tension moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes are established early and effectively tightened when the conflict becomes personal through the connection to Elara. The climax is a result of Alistair’s agency, and the cost of his decision is clear. However, the escalation of the "spatial mutiny" conflict is largely observed rather than experienced, which keeps the pressure at a slight remove until the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.2)
    The stakes (life vs. security) are high and clearly established. However, the on-page escalation lacks significant friction. The obstacles—a predictable guard, a known safe combination—are overcome with practiced ease. This makes the execution feel more like a procedural success than a tense, high-wire act where failure feels imminent.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a powerful, non-traditional conflict: a single individual's focused effort against the entropy of forgetting. The stake—preserving "textures of time"—is abstract but made tangible through the ritual. The escalation is the approach of dawn, a temporal pressure that culminates in a moment of intense focus, and the successful notation reweights his purpose with the cost of continued, lonely duty. It's a masterful execution of quiet, high-stakes conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the protagonist's struggle for a coherent identity—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal and existential, which aligns with the story's lens. Instead of traditional escalation, the story achieves a powerful deepening of understanding, culminating in a resolution of Earned Stasis. The cost—renouncing the fight for the old self—is legible and feels earned by the preceding accumulation of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the universal riddle—is signaled early and remains the clear focus. The conflict escalates well as Evelyn uses the cello to uncover the astronomers' debate, creating a clear tightening of pressure. Her final action of completing the melody constitutes an earned resolution driven by agency, with the cost being a fundamental shift in her professional and philosophical purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes are high and clearly defined, the conflict lacks on-page friction. Maya's resistance campaign succeeds with remarkable ease, and the corporate antagonists are never more than a brief, comical sketch. The story tells us "desperation mounted" but fails to dramatize any significant setbacks, which lessens the impact of the final victory.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a single, potent stake—preserving a memory against oblivion—and escalates the pressure effectively through the countdown of the chemical timer and the dawning sun. The conflict is primarily situational (Elena vs. time), and the tension is well-maintained. The resolution is earned through Elena's endurance, and the cost is unambiguous and poignant: the irreversible extinction of the fireflies. Her personal success is powerfully juxtaposed with this larger, tragic loss.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—repairing the drone before the ship departs—is established early and provides clear temporal pressure. The escalation is textural, deepening through the focused, delicate work of the repair against the ticking clock of the ship's departure.

The cost is the immense, patient effort required, which is dramatized effectively through the slow, meticulous pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)

This deepening provides a clear sense of progression under the accumulative lens, and the final cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a single, powerful dominant stake—repaying a debt to free a soul—and escalates it with perfect timing.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—Elara's search for meaning—and successfully deepens it throughout the scene. This intensification works well within the Accumulative lens. However, the external pressure from the "intercontinental maglev at noon" deadline feels incidental and adds little tangible tension to her actions or choices. While the final cost is legible, the path to it lacks the friction that a more pressing constraint would have provided, leaving the conflict feeling entirely cerebral.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—a coup—is clear and the pressure escalates effectively when Elara discovers the planned "accidents," a strong narrative tightening. Her agency drives the resolution. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the conspiracy unravels through her actions, but the story relies on the villains' plan being surprisingly fragile, which somewhat deflates the tension of her solution.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear emotional stake early and escalates it effectively. The initial message ("I'm sorry") is correctly identified as insufficient, which forces the protagonist into a more focused act of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.0)

The cost is the emotional weight of this gentle fabrication, which lands with beautiful subtlety in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.5)

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—Elena’s methodical certainty versus a new intuitive perception—is established well and deepens with each awakening. The final cost, exchanging certainty for curiosity, is legible and felt. However, the conflict is almost entirely passive; Elena is a recipient of revelations rather than an agent wrestling with them. The absence of resistance or internal friction makes the escalation feel predetermined rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are high and established early, with the conflict escalating effectively under an Accumulative lens. The pressure deepens decisively when the narrative reveals the taxation of dreams, forcing the resistance from covert communication to a nationwide action.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—the poet’s internal battle to transform suffering into communal serenity—is established early and deepens effectively over the vast timescale.

The cost is immense and rendered with finality.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a powerful dominant stake: the fight against entropy and forgetting. The conflict is quiet but profound. The discovery of the cracked tube provides a clear inciting incident, and the realization that "no ordinary adhesive would mend this sacred object" serves as a meaningful tightening, forcing a higher-stakes, more difficult solution. The resolution is earned through Eleth's specific actions, and the cost—the temporary nature of the victory—charges the final image with poignant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciliation versus permanent division—is established early and remains the clear focus. Pressure escalates effectively through the ticking clock ("before paths diverge") and the accumulative weight of Elena's discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Mara's search for deeper meaning—is established but remains entirely internal and contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake—revitalizing possibility itself—and escalates pressure effectively through textural deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes a clear stake: deciphering the past.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—persuading the mirrors to reveal possibilities—is established early and pursued with clear agency.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—ending the forever war—is established immediately and carries immense weight. The pressure escalates appropriately from brokering the initial breach to the "harder work" of mapping resources.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story masterfully handles a purely internal conflict. The dominant stake—whether Silas will act on his secret impulse for atonement—is clear and compelling.

This act serves as the story's meaningful deepening, foreclosing the option of private hoarding and externalizing his internal shift with the felt cost of final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—validating a model of ethical storytelling—is clear, and the performance serves as a successful test. However, the pressure feels low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a profound and deeply felt stake—honoring the passage of the last monarch—and intensifies it not through external action but through a powerful internal deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=5.2)
    A clear dominant stake—the rescue mission—is established early, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation.

    The central conflict is a person-versus-puzzle scenario that lacks meaningful escalation or opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central stake—preserving memory against oblivion—is established early and held consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—defying hopelessness—is established well, but the conflict lacks immediate pressure or a credible risk of failure.

    The dominant stake—a psychological and spiritual quest against a ticking clock—is signaled early and held taut throughout. The pressure escalates organically through the ascent, driven by the protagonist's agency and the temporal constraint of the inverted gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stake—whether Elias can create his sonic landscape for healing—is clear. The conflict is subtle: man against the ambient anxieties of others.

The conflict escalates cleanly as Elara solves one puzzle (the monolith) which leads to the next challenge (the ancient tree).

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes a clear and urgent stake: saving the archives before dawn. However, the escalation of conflict feels weak because obstacles are resolved too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict is abstract yet rendered with palpable tension, especially during the performance where the prophecy is felt "thrumming against his music."

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant internal stake—Elias's obsession with precision—is effectively externalized and escalated.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—redeeming a profound failure—is signaled early and effectively deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is signaled early and the initial pursuit builds tension effectively. However, the final confrontation lacks a meaningful escalation; the 73-year resistance of this "most challenging quarry" is overcome by a method that works immediately and without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—compressing eternity—is established early and tested with escalating pressure that is both coherent and visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.0)
    The stakes are high and clearly defined from the start, and the midnight deadline provides a functional source of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—seeking the boundary of rational understanding—is well-defined and drives the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake effectively deepens from a simple physical problem (being lost) to a profound existential one (finding one's place in the human continuum). The pressure is coherent for an accumulative story, intensifying internally through the visions from the slide. The resolution is an active choice driven by her new understanding, but the lack of any significant obstacle or trade-off keeps the tension from feeling truly high.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story builds pressure effectively within its quiet, internal framework.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—reviving the town's spirit versus accepting a superficial, "failed utopia"—is established early and remains central.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes deepen powerfully from a personal intellectual quest to the preservation of a civilization's emotional soul. This escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency (his choice to immerse himself) and lands with an unmistakable cost: the loss of his former peace and the assumption of a terrible burden. The story achieves this meaningful tightening within a quiet, internal framework, which is a significant accomplishment.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding time viscerally before her own expires—is clear and compelling. The conflict is a brilliant externalization of an internal struggle: imposing order on the chaos of preserved life to reverse entropy. Pressure deepens effectively under the accumulative lens as the ritual progresses and the environment responds, culminating in a resolution earned entirely by her agency and focus.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central conflict—a philosophical and professional stake about the validity of ancient wisdom versus modern data—is established early and held consistently. Pressure escalates atmospherically, driven by the approaching solstice storm, which serves as an effective ticking clock. The climax, driven by Elias's agency in setting up the experiment, provides a decisive resolution where the cost (a lifetime of being seen as an eccentric) is re-contextualized as a price worth paying.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—Elion's quest for spiritual meaning—is clear and compelling. The narrative deepens effectively when the "call" forces a choice between his safe routine and an unknown spiritual reality, a decision he makes with full agency. While the conflict lacks external pressure, the escalation of internal longing is handled with coherence and leads to a resolution with a clear, albeit conceptual, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding and fulfilling the covenant's requirement—is established early and pursued consistently. The pressure deepens effectively under an Accumulative lens, culminating in the realization that silence is the key. This insight acts as the meaningful tightening, forcing a renunciation of speech that constitutes a clear, felt cost. The resolution is earned entirely through the protagonist's agency, a quiet but decisive act of presence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the nature of time—is clear, and the conflict is a coherent intellectual mystery. The escalation occurs as Elara’s discoveries increase the weight of her responsibility, which is a legitimate form of pressure. However, the tension is muted, as the struggle is summarized ("Elara spent days...") rather than dramatized, and the "terrifying" aspect of the truth is asserted but not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing an elusive concept in poetry—is clear but remains static for most of the story. The single point of escalation, the snapping kite string, is an external coincidence that serves as a metaphor rather than a genuine tightening of pressure on the character's choices. The conflict lacks a sense of rising tension or a meaningful trade-off with a felt cost, resulting in a gentle deepening rather than a compelling escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—completing the work before death—is established immediately and provides relentless, coherent pressure. The escalation is handled elegantly through the passing months and Elias's waning strength, a clear tightening of the conflict between his purpose and his mortality. His final, trembling actions to complete the circuit demonstrate agency under pressure, and the cost is paid with his life, fulfilling the stakes perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—Elian's need to reconcile his scientific skepticism with the "mystical" data from first contact—is clear from the start. Pressure deepens texturally through his walk, culminating in a decisive choice that resolves the conflict. The stakes are personal and well-defined, and the resolution carries a clear, identity-altering cost.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the battlefield to restore a lost harmony—is well-established. However, the conflict is largely static, portraying a sustained effort rather than escalating pressure. The bird's call provides a single, minor tactical shift, but there's no significant tightening of stakes or narrowing of options during the main scene. The central conflict of one man against a vast wasteland is compelling conceptually but lacks on-page dramatization of meaningful setbacks or rising opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—reuniting with Elara—is established immediately and remains the unwavering focus. The conflict escalates effectively through a series of puzzles that narrow Silas's options and refine his path, from a broad search to a specific set of coordinates. The resolution is driven entirely by his agency in decoding the clues, and the cost of his long, solitary effort is palpable, making the climax feel entirely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central conflict between isolation and purpose is well-defined and deepens effectively through the ritual of sketching. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure builds through layers of memory, duty, and silence, forcing the final crystallization of her stance. The resolution doesn't erase the cost of her loneliness but re-contextualizes it, which is a strong and earned outcome for this kind of quiet story.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the global stakes—mending the fabric of reality—are immense, the on-page conflict lacks meaningful escalation. Kael moves from one puzzle to the next without opposition or setback, which keeps the pressure static rather than increasing. The resolution is achieved through task completion, not by overcoming a difficult, adapting opposition, which flattens the sense of a truly earned victory.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—is established early and remains central. The escalation is not a reversal but a significant deepening: the success of unbinding one memory forces Elara to confront the true, ruthless calculus of her work. This turn, driven by her own agency, makes the cost of her mission tangible and sharpens the conflict's focus beautifully in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the shape of home—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal, and the discovery of the lost language stone provides a meaningful deepening of knowledge that alters Maven's options. The story escalates the pressure through the "hidden thunder," culminating in a final choice to engage her power that resolves the stake with a clear, conceptual cost (re-defining 'home').

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the tutor's need for self-forgiveness—is established early and remains the central focus. The "lull of distant thunder" provides an effective ticking clock, creating a meaningful tightening of pressure as he is warned that "only two minutes remained." The resolution is earned through the protagonist's internal transformation, with the forty-year exile serving as a clear and significant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Elara's life versus the ideological freedom of her people—is established early and remains sharp. Pressure escalates effectively under an Accumulative lens as the ritual nears and her sessions draw attention from the "Ritual Overseers." The story delivers a meaningful deepening of the stakes when Elara accepts her potential sacrifice, and the cost is legible in her final act of defiance. The conflict is primarily conceptual, but the external threat provides sufficient tension.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—conjuring meaning from a fractured past—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The conflict is internal, and the escalation is achieved by deepening the emotional weight of each memory, not through external turns. The story's one meaningful intensification, when the workshop tilts, makes the metaphysical threat physical and forces the re-evaluation that leads to closure. The cost is the acceptance of a painful past as essential, which is felt clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—Elias's internal struggle to fulfill his promise against fading memory—is established early and remains the unwavering focus. The discovery of the seashell serves as a powerful deepening of this conflict, reconfiguring his understanding rather than simply escalating the stakes. The resolution is earned through this internal shift, and the cost is the felt weight of twenty years of grief and solitude, which makes the final peace all the more profound.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—proving a gentle power can bridge an impossible distance to a lost loved one—is established early and held throughout. The conflict between Elias's method and Captain Morgan's skepticism provides steady, low-level external pressure. The story's single tightening point, the ritual itself, is decisive, and the cost (an emotional connection that confirms physical separation) is poignant and clear on the page, satisfying the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—guiding a ship safely home to redeem past losses—is signaled early and remains clear throughout. Under the accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively as the moon reaches its zenith, the censer's power peaks, and the navigator's abilities are tested. The cost is ever-present in the background of sorrow ("so many had been lost") and is made tangible in the navigator's scars, giving the successful navigation a palpable sense of earned, fragile redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—achieving psychological safety—is established early and remains the focus. The ritual provides a clear point of intensification, escalating the personal investment. While the protagonist's agency drives the attempt, the final turn is prompted by a fortunate discovery rather than a difficult choice or consequence of her actions, slightly softening the impact of the earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need to understand a profound disturbance to his isolation—is well-established. The pressure deepens as the memories arrive, disrupting his internal world. However, the escalation lacks strong protagonist agency; the memories largely happen *to* him. The resolution provides a clear emotional cost, but the path to it feels more like endurance and reception than a series of choices made under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant internal stake—to find a "true purpose" and resolve a haunting promise—is signaled early and remains the focus. Pressure deepens effectively in the cavern, where the protagonist is forced to confront the totality of his life's crossroads. The final choice to step through a single doorway is a decisive act with a clear, felt cost—the renunciation of all other possibilities—which powerfully resolves the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—overcoming disenchantment—is clear, but the resolution lacks a significant felt cost. The journey's outcome is a net gain of a "wellspring of strength," which reframes her existing duties rather than forcing a difficult trade-off or sacrifice. The conflict's pressure is primarily physical (the climb) and is resolved without forcing a moral or tactical compromise, softening the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—how a secret will change a core relationship and a life's work—is signaled early and escalates effectively. The pressure builds from quiet anticipation to the weight of the revelation, forcing a decisive internal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stakes—Elias’s struggle to find meaning in chaos—are established early and deepened effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant internal stake—Elara's search for connection after loss—is signaled early and coherently tested. The pressure deepens through the vulnerable exchange with Lena, leading to a meaningful shift in Elara's emotional state. The resolution is earned within the story's quiet scope, with the cost being the full acceptance of her new reality.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.4)
    The stakes are clear, personal, and consistently tested. The conflict escalates beautifully from an internal struggle against anxiety to a direct physical threat when the platform tilts, forcing Elara's agency to the forefront. This tightening is driven by a combination of internal and external pressures, and the cost of success is legible in the intense physical and mental control she must exert to avoid shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Eloise's need for forgiveness—is established immediately and remains the focus. The pressure deepens effectively when the ritual succeeds, forcing the difficult, vulnerable apology. The resolution carries a clear, earned cost: the connection is temporary and the healing incomplete, a consequence directly driven by the protagonist’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake—completing unification within the "universe's hiccup." Pressure escalates effectively as this temporal window closes, forcing the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake—to understand time's true nature—is established early and remains the story's focus.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story effectively signals its dominant stake: understanding the mysterious strangers and the nature of security. The conflict deepens well, shifting from a physical threat assessment to a complex communication challenge. The final cost—the complete upending of Elara’s professional paradigm—is legible and feels significant, even if the escalation path to it is more of a single, decisive insight than a series of tightening turns.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—reconciling two languages of chance—and escalates it effectively through a single, decisive deepening: the discovery of the Fibonacci sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)

The escalation is entirely internal and emotional, which is perfectly suited to the story's lens.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—navigating internal grief—is signaled early and remains the focus. Pressure deepens effectively as the musical notes intensify, forcing difficult memories to the surface and creating a coherent escalation of internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—rectifying a significant professional error and its consequences—is established early and effectively. The pressure builds internally, culminating in her "unprecedented" decision to act, which serves as the story's single, meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes a clear, if abstract, stake: to make the unheard heard. Pressure escalates effectively under an Accumulative lens, moving from the inanimate (boats) to individual sorrow (the woman) to collective feeling (the crowd), which constitutes a meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—Maya's redemption—is established early, but the conflict lacks on-page escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)

The escalation is subtle but clear, culminating in a resolution that feels earned and carries a tangible cost in the form of increased future scrutiny from Vance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—the "half-spoken secret"—is established, but the declared high stakes ("fate of the canal") feel disconnected from the quiet, internal resolution. The pressure builds texturally rather than through escalating causal events that directly threaten the stakes. The final choice is an act of endurance and witness, but the link between the light patterns and the transformation of the large-scale stakes remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—reawakening the town's creativity—is clear and compelling. The escalation through the secret planning of the displays builds tension effectively. The primary weakness is the lack of tangible opposition; the "rigid educational philosophy" remains an abstract antagonist, leading to a resolution that feels too smooth and frictionless, lessening the felt cost of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara's liberation from a profound emptiness—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal, and pressure escalates effectively through a series of external, magical triggers under an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—reclaiming emotional authenticity after collective trauma—is established early and deepens throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—achieving artistic and spiritual transcendence—is clear, and the story effectively deepens the pressure through sensory intensification under its accumulative lens. The poet demonstrates agency in initiating the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—bartering for Gideon's awakening—is signaled early and builds to a clear climax. The cost for Gideon is legible: he trades his former mastery for a new appreciation of imperfection. However, the conflict resolution for Elara lacks a corresponding cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, if quiet, internal stake: the protagonist's quest for understanding. The conflict deepens effectively under the Accumulative lens, moving from general inquiry to a specific experimental test.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stake of finding "true healing" is established, and the pressure escalates through an accumulation of mysterious information.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    The internal conflict escalates effectively under the Accumulative lens, with the "hushed thunder" building from a feeling to an audible vibration.

This deepening provides a clear "before/after" state, and the cost is the emotional burden she accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake of freeing trapped creativity is established immediately and remains the unwavering focus. The escalation, viewed through an accumulative lens, successfully deepens the central problem until Elara's ritual provides a decisive shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—to find unused courage—is established early and deepened decisively at the climax. The conflict is atmospheric rather than interpersonal, with the pressure building through the strange, winding journey.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a powerful dominant stake—safety in silence versus purpose in music—and escalates it effectively. The pressure deepens with the protagonist's dawning knowledge, consistent with the accumulative lens. The final choice is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency and carries an unmistakable on-page cost: he forfeits the fortress's protection to reclaim his voice. The conflict feels both personal and mythic in scale.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is established early and effectively deepened by the cryptic messages, shifting it from a political to a psychological challenge. Escalation is handled skillfully through the library's accelerating collapse, which externalizes the urgency. The final choice to perform the ritual carries a clear, felt cost: the destruction of her sanctuary and the renunciation of her inherited identity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the truth behind the disappearing coastlines—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The pressure escalates effectively under the Accumulative lens, as mounting data deepens the mystery rather than resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—the internal quest for meaning—is clear and effectively pressurized by the atmospheric setting.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the embryo to evolve tradition—is clear and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant internal stake—reconciling past joy with present trauma—is established early and powerfully intensified by the situational pressure of the anniversary. Under the accumulative lens, this deepening of emotional weight forces a stance crystallization. The final act of releasing the photograph is a clear choice with an unmistakable cost, providing a potent and earned resolution to the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—maintaining meaning against chaos—is established but remains largely philosophical and static. The primary conflict is in the backstory (Rhiannon vs. her father's legacy), leaving the present-tense action with very low pressure. While the focus on a single cutting provides a moment of deepening, it doesn't meaningfully escalate the stakes or force a difficult trade-off. The story depicts the *result* of a conflict rather than the conflict itself.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.5)

The conflict deepens decisively upon the discovery of the letters, which raises the stakes by offering a tangible, risky path to resolution. The climax is a direct result of the protagonist’s agency, with the final emotional state being hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central stake—finding meaning in chaos versus imposing rigid order—is established early and brought to a sharp focus by the zealots' arrival. The conflict escalates effectively into a confrontation where Silas's agency is demonstrated through a high-stakes artistic choice, not violence or argument. The resolution is earned, with the cost of accepting impermanence made clear.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict between despair and renewal is well-defined. The narrative deepens effectively when Elias shifts from passive remembering to the active ritual of renaming, a choice driven by his agency. The cost is legible; his victory is one of spirit and naming, which does not erase the physical "cold reality," making the stakes feel authentic for the story's scale.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are established early and are deeply personal: the loss of the garden means the loss of Silas's last mortal connection. The conflict escalates effectively as he must expend his own spectral essence, his form "flickering" under the strain. This provides a clear, visible cost to his actions, earning the resolution and making his final bow impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—finding a cure for her brother and other victims—is established early and carries high personal weight. The conflict is primarily internal, pitting Maya's skepticism against the mounting evidence, which provides a consistent source of tension. The escalation is effective, moving from observation to a deliberate experiment that provides the crucial data, thus deepening the stakes as a solution becomes tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the hibernation—is well-established and propels the narrative. However, the conflict resolves with remarkable ease once the fossil is found. The discovery presents a solution, not a new complication or a difficult choice, and Maya's acceptance of her role feels more like a reward than a costly trade-off, softening the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central conflict—unscrambling the prophecy—is primarily intellectual. While this fits the story's quiet tone, the stakes remain abstract ("spin this prophecy into raw possibility"). The pressure deepens knowledge rather than narrowing options, which is valid for the chosen lens, but the lack of any meaningful opposition or trade-off makes the resolution feel gentle and assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake—reclaiming purpose—and deepens it effectively. The turn on revealing the daughter's photograph provides a sharp, clarifying escalation, moving the conflict from abstract to deeply personal. The resolution carries a legible cost: the difficult acceptance that "some breaks couldn't be mended," which makes his newfound resolve feel earned and weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    The metaphysical stakes—maintaining the balance between worlds—are successfully grounded in the tangible, urgent action of the stitching ritual. Under the Accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively not through external events but through an intensifying internal focus against a clear deadline ("His fingers worked faster now..."). The cost is felt in his solitude and the small prick of blood, a token for his larger, unending duty, making the final earned stasis feel meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—the quest for understanding—is signaled early and escalates effectively through an accumulation of supernatural phenomena. The key deepening occurs when Kael shifts from passive observer to active participant, using his tools on the earth. The resolution is earned, with the cost being his new, self-imposed duty to share this wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara's need to find a meaningful expression for her vague desire to "reflect light"—is established early. The conflict is primarily internal. The encounter with Jim serves as the story's single, decisive deepening, transforming her abstract goal into a concrete, personal legacy. While the external pressure is low, the intensification of her purpose is clear and the cost—a quiet commitment to this solitary work—is felt in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal conflict is rendered with convincing pressure, escalating from a "particularly delicate" awakening to a profound internal shift. The dominant stake—defining her identity—is reweighted by the story's end, shifting from a desire for separation to an embrace of connection. The resolution is earned through Elena's agency in choosing to "coexist," a stance crystallization that forecloses the Aethenian path of control with the felt cost of her prior suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.2)
    The internal stake—recovering creative and spiritual purpose—is well-established. However, the conflict's pressure is purely atmospheric and resolves without friction. The final turn is a realization, not a choice made under duress, and it comes without a visible cost or trade-off, which deflates the tension and makes the resolution feel too easy for the stated problem.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—humanity's cognitive freedom—is established early and remains the focus. The pressure escalates coherently to the climax, where Elara makes a high-risk choice. The cost is made legible in the final lines: humanity is no longer ignorant but is now an active, visible player in a dangerous cosmic game. The resolution is earned entirely through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—freedom for her people—and escalates the pressure effectively from personal fear to the physical agony of the ritual. The final choice is driven entirely by Elara's agency, and the cost (leaving her world for an unknown one) is made tangible. The conflict is coherent and intensifies to a satisfying climax where the stakes are irrevocably transformed.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.5)
    The initial stake—solving an "unsolvable" cold case—is strong, but the escalation is linear rather than dynamic. Pressure is established as a static condition (lack of evidence) rather than a rising force. The resolution feels sudden, and because the climax is summarized off-page, the conflict resolves without a dramatized final confrontation, deflating the built-up tension and leaving the payoff feeling theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—vindicating an ancestor and potentially reversing global chaos—is established early and remains the clear focus. Pressure escalates effectively from a research problem to a practical, high-stakes decision once the controls are revealed. The story culminates in a choice driven by Eli's agency, and the cost is made legible in the "overwhelming responsibility" they feel, representing a clear and earned trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will remain defined by past rejection or "sculpt possibility"—is clear and compelling. Pressure deepens effectively under the accumulative lens as the surreal evidence mounts, forcing a re-evaluation of reality. His final choice to step onto the scaffold is an act of agency that pays off the stake with the visible cost of leaving his world, foreclosing the path of stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Elias's attempt to build an honorable legacy—is clear and consistently tested. The confrontation with Marcus provides a solid, on-page tightening of pressure. Elias's response demonstrates agency, and the ultimate failure of the startup serves as a visible, significant cost. The conflict escalation is primarily internal and thematic, which is appropriate for the chosen accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the inscriptions to access healing wisdom—is established early and remains central. The arrival of the telegram and the subsequent celestial discovery serve as a meaningful deepening of knowledge, raising the stakes. The resolution is earned by Elara's choice to collaborate, but the pressure leading to this choice feels gentle rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—freeing the mentor—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The progression through the "expanding circles" provides a clear escalation of pressure. The conflict's impact is softened because the protagonist's "warlike serenity never wavered," removing any sense of imminent failure or a true test of her limits. The lack of a meaningful, felt cost at the climax keeps the stakes from reaching their full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—restoring the covenant—is well-established and the narrative deepens the pressure as the visionary commits to the ritual. The escalation is coherent within its accumulative structure. The primary weakness is the resolution, which lacks a clear, on-page cost; the visionary achieves their goal and is freed from their burden, making the victory feel complete rather than earned through a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: capturing the escaped sorrow to restore balance. Under an Accumulative lens, the conflict deepens effectively as the memory appears and resists. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through a focused, ritualistic act, and the cost of her ongoing sacrifice is made explicit, charging the ending with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant internal stake—reclaiming purpose amidst loss—is established early and meaningfully deepened by the protagonist's agency. The act of appraisal becomes a high-stakes test of self-worth, and the turn from factual analysis to personal memory ("The '72 Leeds festival") provides a strong, earned escalation. The cost is the palpable pain of memory, making the final glimmer of hope feel authentic and hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the arbor without succumbing to the madness that claimed her predecessors—is established early and remains the central pressure. For an accumulative story, the pressure deepens effectively, moving from the abstract weight of responsibility to the tangible plan and departure. The final scene on the vessel, with the seed responding to the environment, marks a decisive intensification that makes the stakes feel immediate and visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation or stakes that are tested on the page. The central "conflict" is a cyclical, accepted ritual, and the pressure from the tide is environmental, not antagonistic. Because the outcome is preordained and the librarian is in a state of acceptance, there is no meaningful turn that alters tactics or intensifies the core stake.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story signals a professional stake that is almost immediately abandoned for a conceptual one. The primary moment of pressure, "the heartbeat of a hesitation," is resolved too quickly to generate significant tension. Escalation is absent; instead of rising pressure that narrows options, the character experiences a single, overwhelming download of purpose. The cost is felt but the path to it lacks meaningful conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake of self-forgiveness is established immediately and remains the clear focus. The conflict deepens effectively under an accumulative lens, as each clue intensifies Elena’s proximity to the raw truth she has been avoiding. Her agency drives the resolution, and the cost of her journey—embracing un-medicated grief—is paid on the page, solidifying the story's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—accessing the library's forbidden knowledge—is established immediately. Pressure escalates effectively through atmospheric means, culminating in a clear tightening when the watch begins "vibrating urgently," imposing a deadline. The protagonist's agency is demonstrated in their decision to enter and to document their findings under this pressure. While the conflict is primarily situational, it is coherent and resolves with a tangible cost (the library vanishes).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake early on and effectively tightens the pressure with a hard deadline. The conflict escalates well when the coffee reading forces a tactical shift from preservation to propagation. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the cost—the inert original violin—is made concrete and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake—redemption through preservation—and expertly deepens it. The escalation, fitting the Accumulative lens, comes from the growing clarity of the memories and the intensification of the aurora. The final image of the shelf of captured souls makes the cost of Elara's unending mission tangible, providing a resolution that is both satisfying and haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding true peace—is internal and clearly signaled. Under the accumulative lens, the escalation is a successful deepening of her philosophical quest rather than a series of external reversals. However, the conflict remains low-pressure throughout. The final resolution, while fitting the tone, lacks the feeling of a hard-won victory over a significant obstacle or a costly trade-off, which keeps the stakes from feeling viscerally high.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—guiding the fisherman to a nuanced choice—is clearly signaled and resolved through Elian's agency. The conflict escalates internally as Elian processes the dilemma, a deepening consistent with the textural drive. The cost is made legible in the final paragraphs, successfully linking his professional choice to a personal emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—Maya's struggle to understand a paradoxical concept—is clear and effectively deepened through the lesson. The reveal of the grotto provides a meaningful tightening. However, the introduction of Elien's life-gain stake in the final sentence is an unearned resolution to a conflict that was never presented, weakening the focus on Maya's earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a high-concept, metaphysical stake—to navigate without moving—and pursues it relentlessly. Escalation works perfectly under the accumulative lens, with the crows' flight and the discovery of the canyon's heart serving as meaningful deepenings that narrow Kael’s path. The protagonist's agency is demonstrated in his ritual actions, and the final cost—his physical existence—is clear and proportionate to the profound knowledge gained.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—authentic magic versus automated perfection—is signaled early and remains the central focus. The conflict escalates to a single, meaningful tightening point: the choice to remove the standardized pack.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    The central stake—understanding a mysterious gift—is established early and escalates effectively under an Accumulative lens. Instead of direct opposition, the pressure is a pull toward revelation, which deepens when the librarian reframes the protagonist's entire quest. The resolution is earned through acceptance and a vow, with the cost being a newly embraced purpose, which is legible in the story's final image.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are ultimate—the fate of humanity—and are signaled early. Pressure escalates effectively with the announcement that "The contraction accelerates," providing a clear tightening of the timeline. The central conflict between faith (Loran's enthusiasm) and doubt (Korin's fear) is clear, but its resolution feels too simple; the conflict is resolved by a sudden, convenient insight rather than a difficult trade-off or a choice that carries a lingering, personal cost for Loran.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story establishes a powerful, singular internal stake—overcoming grief—and deepens it through a series of resonant memories and reflections. The escalation is entirely protagonist-driven, culminating in a decisive choice to act. The cost is the emotional pain of confronting his loss, which is made unmistakable on the page and directly leads to his earned release, satisfying the core requirements for excellence under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    The stakes—the survival of a community on the brink of collapse—are established immediately and maintained throughout. The conflict is primarily internal and environmental, and the intensification of pressure is handled well through the mage's growing obsession. The resolution is driven by protagonist agency, making the victory feel earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively deepens the stakes from preserving a romanticized memory to the moral imperative of reclaiming a suppressed truth. This escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency—his choice to investigate. The final decision to petition the authorities creates a clear resolution that carries the cost of abandoning his thirty-year "precisely humane" but complicit role, making the conflict's resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—successfully completing this ritual—is clear from the start. The pressure escalates atmospherically, and the moment the starlings form the alchemical symbol provides a meaningful deepening of knowledge that precipitates the climax. However, the conflict lacks a sense of immediate jeopardy; success feels inevitable, and the resolution is achieved without a palpable price being paid on the page, which slightly mutes the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—the survival of the suspended civilization—is established early and effectively deepened by the arrival of the anomalous data. The pressure escalates from passive observation to active crisis response, forcing a clear stance crystallization from the protagonist. The cost of this choice is not physical but psychological and social: the burden of delivering a truth that will shatter their world's known rules.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—vivifying the brain before the temporal wave hits—is signaled early and consistently escalated. The pressure deepens effectively by linking the external threat to Maya's internal struggle, forcing a choice that has a clear and immediate cost. The resolution is earned directly through her agency in confronting her numbness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is appropriately scaled for the story's length and internal focus. The stake—safeguarding creative innovation—is established early and deepened by the arrival of the seed. The story achieves a meaningful intensification under its textural lens, and the resolution carries the legible cost of committing to a more patient and difficult creative path.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal conflict—a man versus the oppressive silence of his grief—is rendered with immense power. The stake is clear and visceral. The story deepens the pressure not with external events but by intensifying the protagonist's ritual, which culminates in a turn—the impossible echo—that forces a new, crystallized stance with a clear and poignant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the guardian's existential exile—is established immediately and remains the central focus. The conflict is primarily internal, escalating effectively when the pendant's surge provides an external pressure point. The guardian's agency is demonstrated in their choice to actively engage with the chaotic energy, a decision which has a clear and transformative cost: the loss of their old self, which is legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—Elias's struggle against his destiny—is established early and tested throughout the ritual. Pressure deepens with each failed attempt and the dimming of the embers, creating a subtle but effective escalation. The final choice is driven by protagonist agency, and the cost (the irreversible transformation of the sacred relic) is clear and directly linked to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal, effectively pitting Elara's method against the noise that defeated her predecessors. The stakes—achieving a unique form of cosmic understanding—are clear. The pressure escalates effectively with the lunar perigee, and the use of the "shard of hush" serves as a meaningful turn that narrows the story's focus to the final, silent attempt, making the resolution feel earned by her specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—healing a fractured existence by merging timelines—is established early and pursued with focus. Pressure escalates effectively, moving from preparation to the eerie transformation and culminating in the high-stakes convergence at the grotto. The final choice is driven entirely by Liam's agency, and the cost—his new, untethered existence—is made explicit and feels appropriately scaled to the cosmic nature of his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding connection—is established early and tested under escalating pressure. The conflict deepens effectively when Elias loses control of his creation, forcing him to make a choice (touch the tapestry) with a visible cost: the dissolution of his old reality. This shift from controlled architect to active participant provides a strong, agency-driven climax.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—validating a revolutionary idea against skepticism—is clear and compelling. However, the escalation feels compressed, relying on a "Weeks passed" summary rather than a sequence of tightening pressures or choices. The resolution, while earned, lacks a final, high-stakes test of agency, diminishing the conflict's overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the child's safety—is signaled effectively and escalates from a vague emotional urgency to a specific, life-or-death threat.

The resolution is earned through her direct action, and the cost is legible in the calming of the hearing aid, signifying the closure of her grandmother's long-held terror.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake and escalates pressure effectively through the ticking clock of the tide and intensifying environmental phenomena ("pipes began to hum," "foundations to trembling stone"). The protagonist's agency is demonstrated through her choice to endure and complete her task. The only minor weakness is that the actual subjects of the conflict, the shadows, are entirely passive, making the central task a ritual of grace rather than a struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the past to find peace—is established early and pursued with agency. The conflict deepens effectively from investigating a random accident to understanding a systemic, albeit mistaken, action against the protagonist. The resolution, an acceptance of a new state of being, carries a clear and legible cost, foreclosing the path of a "return to life."

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.5)
    This is the story's weakest category due to a lack of immediate, escalating pressure. The conflict is a passive, decades-long struggle against entropy rather than a dynamic opposition. The climax is prompted by a sudden opportunity, not a final, difficult choice forced by tightening stakes, which mutes the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central stake—whether to reveal the cryptids for vindication or protect them—is clear and effectively deepens over the course of the story. The conflict shifts inward, and the resolution is earned through Aris’s conscious choice to become a witness rather than a captor. This renunciation represents a significant and legible cost, fulfilling the requirements for high-stakes emotional conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—reawakening beauty—is established early and tested directly. The conflict with the statues provides a clear point of pressure, escalating when they stir and force her escape. However, the resolution of the obstacles feels somewhat smooth; the heart-rhythm key works perfectly both times, reducing the sense of peril and the cost of her victory.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—safely delivering the bottle—is established immediately and tested under escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—reawakening dormant stories—is established early and pursued with focus.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—deciphering her sister's fate—is signaled early and remains the clear focus.

The resolution is earned through her agency in applying this new knowledge, and the cost is the bittersweet transformation of her grief into a new form of communication.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—freeing a trapped idea—is clear and maintained throughout. The story achieves escalation under its accumulative lens, with the ritual thickening the atmosphere and bending reality. However, the conflict's pressure feels directed entirely outward; Silas is never shown to be at risk or in doubt, which mutes the tension and keeps the stakes, while conceptually high, from feeling personally perilous for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stake—reclaiming a fragmented self—is potent and established early. The story provides a single, meaningful deepening of pressure when Elara connects the constellations to the fairy ring, a turn driven by her agency that shifts her from passive researcher to active agent in her own recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the archivist's need to validate his exile by successfully mentoring resilience—is established early and tested throughout the scene. Pressure deepens through the challenge of teaching his esoteric craft to a nervous apprentice. The resolution, where Prisha demonstrates her newfound resilience by standing her ground, is driven by her agency and provides a clear, earned payoff with a visible cost (the archivist’s continued exile, now re-contextualized as purposeful).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear, internal stake: preserving wonder. The conflict escalates through the focused ritual of "weaving," creating a single, meaningful intensification of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—grounding the spirits to bring peace to Jacob and the sanctuary—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict escalates through the textural deepening of the "interlaced hush" as Elena works, which is a perfect execution for an Accumulative lens. The resolution is driven by Elena's direct agency, and the resulting peace for the spirits and Jacob demonstrates a clear cost-benefit exchange for her efforts.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict is almost entirely intellectual, and the pressure is minimal and largely off-page ("For months, Elara had been methodically comparing..."). There is no meaningful escalation or on-page setback that tests Elara's commitment. The discovery feels inevitable rather than hard-won, which significantly deflates the narrative tension leading up to the otherwise strong resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central stake—deciphering the transmission—is established immediately and deepens effectively when the mystery shifts from a navigational problem to a metaphysical one.

The narrative deepens this stake effectively when Elara discovers the bolt plate, shifting her from a passive perceiver to an active communicator. This discovery serves as the story's meaningful tightening, changing her options and escalating the potential for connection. The cost is felt in the final image: their communication is a success, but it reinforces their shared existence outside normal perception.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the captain's hidden sorrow—is established early and pursued with quiet determination.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—vindicating her and her mentor's controversial theories—is established early and pursued with focus. Pressure deepens effectively under the accumulative lens as her observations grow in significance, culminating in the critical pattern recognition. The escalation is internal but potent, and the cost is clear: her life is at risk, yet this danger is precisely what enables the potential for discovery. This trade-off gives the final choice to continue her work a palpable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—creating a final, meaningful work of art before the library's destruction—is signaled early and consistently pressured by the ticking clock of demolition.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Eli's ambition to make a great discovery—is signaled early and clearly resolved. The conflict is a compelling intellectual puzzle, and the pressure deepens as clues accumulate toward the final revelation. However, the escalation feels smooth and inevitable rather than fraught with tension; the statement that the connection "remained elusive" is the only hint of a struggle, which is not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—learning the "rhythm of repair"—is signaled early and tested at the climax. The pressure tightens effectively when Elias must choose empathy over force, a choice that narrows his options and demonstrates his worthiness. The resolution is earned through this choice, but the conflict remains primarily a man-versus-task challenge without deeper internal contradictions that would add another layer of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.9)
    The stakes (survival) are clear, but the conflict lacks any tangible pressure or escalation. A problem is stated, a magical solution is provided by the ghost, and it works almost immediately with no setbacks or difficult trade-offs. The story asserts there were "setbacks and challenges," but none are dramatized, rendering the resolution feel convenient and unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes cosmic stakes and makes them feel immediate and personal through Elias's actions. Under the Accumulative lens, the conflict escalates effectively as the ritual intensifies and the clock actively resists ("shuddered, its rhythm stuttering"). The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the cost of his tireless duty is legible in his exhaustion, making the victory feel fragile and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The conflict is well-defined and effectively escalated. The dominant stake—the travelers' lives—is clear and immediate, while the timeframe of the forming frost provides a tight, compelling deadline that drives the pace. The resolution is earned directly through the protagonist's risky and skillful actions, and the cost is made tangible by the dimming of the nut's light. The pressure is coherent and holds through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—relational healing versus continued isolation—is clear and compelling. The conflict is primarily internal, and the pressure deepens effectively through Elara's observations, particularly the chrysalis, which forces a painful self-assessment. The final choice to call her sister is a direct and earned result of this accumulated pressure, with the cost of vulnerability made legible on the page. The escalation is purely internal but lands with sufficient force for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories begin—is established early and resolved with a meaningful conceptual deepening rather than a simple reversal. The vendor's agency is shown in their final act of creation, a choice enabled by their internal shift. The cost of this resolution is the historical weight of their confinement and the ongoing constraints of their parole, which are re-contextualized by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, personal stake—Kael's psychological survival against overwhelming remorse. The pressure deepens effectively, moving from the ambient emotion of the fortress to the concentrated repository in the pavilion. Kael’s agency drives the resolution, and the cost of his effort is made visible in the final line, successfully landing the conflict's toll.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.1)
    This is the story's most significant failure. A central problem is stated (division), but it never manifests as active conflict or escalating pressure on the page. Elena's plan is met with immediate acceptance and success, facing no resistance, complications, or pushback. The absence of a meaningful test for the stakes or a visible cost for the protagonist makes the resolution feel unearned and hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is internal—the engineer's successful transformation—and is signaled early. The activation of the device provides a single, effective deepening of pressure that reweights the character's reality. However, the conflict lacks friction; success feels assured from the start, which lessens the tension. The cost of transformation is legible at the end, but the process of getting there feels too smooth to generate high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are clear—renewing defenses against a "coming darkness"—and the one-hour time limit creates tangible pressure. However, the conflict unfolds as a sequence of puzzles solved without any significant setbacks or trade-offs. The climax, particularly the solving of the "personal" final combination, feels vague and resolves too smoothly to feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's dominant stake—restoring music—is deepened effectively. The conflict escalates internally when Elara absorbs the raw emotions from the wood, transforming her abstract goal into a visceral burden. The cost is emotional, embodied in her tears, and this experience directly fuels her "renewed purpose," making the final stance earned under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the nexus before the next phase—is signaled early and tightens effectively with the arrival of the third day. The escalation is primarily internal but coherent, driven by Elias's agency through his analytical process. The resolution is earned through his intellectual and emotional labor, with the cost of his exile being re-contextualized rather than erased, which feels satisfyingly complex.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—recovering the diary's contents—is established immediately and holds throughout. The conflict escalates effectively under an accumulative lens as Elara layers frequencies, creating a palpable increase in resonant pressure. The resolution is driven entirely by her agency, and the cost is legible in the shift of her life's mission, a meaningful trade-off that redefines her future. The lack of a true moment of doubt or potential failure is the only thing holding it from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the mysterious plant—is signaled early and provides a clear goal. The story executes a single, effective deepening when the seed awakens and reveals its secrets. However, the conflict remains low-pressure throughout. The "danger" promised in the first paragraph never materializes, and the resolution arrives as a gentle epiphany rather than a choice made under duress, weakening the sense of earnedness.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes for the colony are high, the on-page pressure feels low. Arion navigates with "practiced precision" and faces no significant setbacks or agonizing choices that would test his commitment. The central conflict resolves through a convenient revelation rather than a difficult choice, and the lack of a palpable cost paid by the protagonist makes the successful outcome feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the town's silence—is established immediately. Pressure deepens effectively when the data reveals anomalies, escalating from a physical mystery to a metaphysical one. The final realization that the event caused "mass unconsciousness" is a significant tightening of the stakes, forcing a re-evaluation of the threat. The cost is conceptual but potent: the understanding that the laws of nature are not what they seem.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes—certifying wonder in a numb world—are ambitious, the conflict remains abstract and lacks tension. There is no on-page opposition, risk of failure, or meaningful obstacle for Eira to overcome. The escalation is purely procedural, building to a foregone conclusion without forcing any trade-offs, which deflates the narrative pressure significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake of overcoming failure is clear and compelling. Pressure escalates effectively through the deliberate, focused stages of the ritual, which serves as a meaningful tightening. Protagonist agency drives the entire sequence, and the cost of confronting his pride and past mistakes is made visible through the visions and his emotional release, directly leading to the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—Elara's quest for a mathematical understanding of emotion—is established early and tested directly. The conflict escalates through her deliberate, methodical actions, heightening the pressure on Thomas from disorientation to genuine panic. Her agency drives the escalation, and the cost is made legible through Thomas's flight and her own chillingly detached analysis.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the stakes are clear (deliver the pendant before the solstice), the on-page conflict is minimal. There is no significant escalation of pressure; in fact, the one mid-story event with the old woman provides a shortcut that lessens the temporal pressure. The journey feels more like a gentle demonstration of magic than a perilous undertaking, which undermines the tension required to make the final success feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—validating Elara's life's work—is signaled early and remains the central focus. The pressure deepens effectively in a single, sufficient turn when she presses the prism to the glass and the revelation exceeds her expectations. The cost is conceptual but clear: her foundational assumptions are shattered, forcing a complete re-evaluation of her quest. The conflict is primarily internal, and its resolution is earned directly through her on-page actions.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring sound by delivering a message—is signaled early and pursued relentlessly. Pressure escalates coherently as Elara is forced to sacrifice memories, a tangible and escalating cost for each step forward. The final choice to deplete the bead's energy provides a clear, earned resolution with a visible price paid for success.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Orion's desire to create meaning from destruction versus societal neglect—is established early and effectively. The choice to accept the magician's silk provides a meaningful tightening, escalating his capabilities and the stakes. The subsequent challenge from the elders tests this new power, leading to a resolution earned by his deliberate action, with a felt, if slightly vague, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—uncovering a hidden truth about identity—and escalates the conflict effectively. The progression from passive observation to active "redirecting" shows agency. The climactic failure to open the door is a meaningful turn that doesn't resolve the conflict but deepens it, with the cost of the shard's spent energy being both visible and consequential for the protagonist's next attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story masterfully intertwines a simple external stake (fix the lamp) with a profound internal one (Elias's isolation). The pressure escalates through discovery rather than direct opposition, reweighting the emotional stakes with each new piece of the keepers' tradition. The final choice to participate is an act of agency that crystallizes his new stance, and the cost—the permanent ache of connection—is made beautifully legible.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—guiding refugees to safety—is established early and effectively tightened when Elara's ability is revealed to be prophetic, not just intuitive. This deepens the conflict from a technical challenge to a moral one with higher, more uncertain consequences. The resolution is an acceptance of this heavier burden, and the cost is legible in the phrase "shadowed elation." The escalation is more of a deepening than a reversal, which suits the story's lens perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal, and the stake—understanding the essence of human connection—is compelling. The pressure escalates coherently under an accumulative lens, intensifying as Kaelen moves from general observation to specific experimentation with dyes. The final resolution is earned by his intellectual and artistic agency, with the cost being a shift in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a high-concept internal stake and delivers a meaningful deepening that reweights it entirely. The climax, a single intensification of resonant frequencies, serves as an effective turning point under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible in the healing of a previously unacknowledged spiritual weariness, making the resolution feel earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—rekindling the realm—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The pressure deepens effectively as the keeper's song grows and their pace quickens, culminating in a resolution earned through their own agency. While the conflict is primarily a task-based struggle, its connection to the off-page communities feels slightly abstract, keeping the stakes from achieving their maximum visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    The internal stake—connection versus solitude—is well-defined and consistently held. The approaching midnight deadline provides effective, coherent pressure. The resolution is an act of protagonist agency, a renunciation of the expected path that carries the clear cost of forgoing the gathering, which is well-scaled for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Eliza's internal quest for meaning and absolution—is well-established. The story achieves a meaningful deepening when the letter's contents are revealed, re-contextualizing the bakers' disappearance and Eliza's relationship to it. However, the felt cost of her "tenuous absolution" is blunted because the specific guilt it resolves is not adequately dramatized beforehand, making the stakes feel slightly less sharp at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—preservation versus oblivion—is clear and compelling. However, the conflict lacks meaningful escalation. Pressure is established but never tightens; Elias faces a problem and solves it in a single, successful attempt without complication, setback, or a moment of genuine doubt. The resolution arrives without a struggle, which diminishes the impact of his ultimate success.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict is expertly structured around a single, dominant stake: Eliza's need to capture the sound before sunrise. Pressure escalates through her calculated actions, moving from low-risk probes to a final, high-stakes deception that guarantees a violent outcome. The tightening is driven entirely by protagonist agency, and the cost—the breaking of the truce—is paid on the page, making the resolution feel earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—whether the protagonist will accept their nature or retreat into skepticism—is signaled early and sharpens into a clear choice. Pressure escalates effectively under the accumulative lens, moving from internal sensation to external confrontation. The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution, and the cost of their choice is unmistakable, making the climax powerful and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the artist's creative soul—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal, and the pressure deepens effectively when the past is literally handed to him via the portrait. The final choice to repaint is an act of agency that earns the resolution, with the cost of confronting his past failure and sorrow made clear on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—finding lost conversations for personal closure—is signaled early and remains the clear focus. The narrative achieves a single, meaningful escalation when the discovery of the map transforms the conflict from passive research into an active, high-risk quest. The cost of the final choice is palpable, requiring Elara to trade the fragile safety of her workshop for the lethal dangers of the abandoned sectors.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=2.1)
    This story contains no meaningful conflict. The protagonist conceives of a goal, executes it without impediment, and succeeds perfectly until dying of old age. The stake—preserving wonder—is never threatened. Without opposition, setback, or a difficult choice, there is no pressure, no escalation, and no earned resolution. This absence of tension is the manuscript's most significant structural failure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Conflict and stakes are executed with superb economy and clarity. The dominant stake (survival of the garden) is established immediately, and the pressure escalates through a series of increasingly dire environmental failures. The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution, and the price of success—the dissolution of its original self—is both high and unmistakable on the page, charging the final image with meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    The stakes are well-defined by linking the personal mystery to the external threat of demolition. However, the escalation lacks bite, as the conflict is resolved not by Leo overcoming a direct obstacle, but by being given the solution. The arrival of the key dissipates the tension around the central goal, making the resolution feel convenient rather than earned through struggle or a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—liberating the laboratory's knowledge—is established early and pursued with focus. The conflict is a compelling person-versus-puzzle scenario, and the pressure deepens effectively as Elara closes in on the solution. The final dance sequence serves as a meaningful climax driven by her agency, and the resolution is earned through her unique skills. The cost is legible in the startling revelation that reframes her life's work, a price that feels appropriately scaled to the story.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—finding where lost memories go—is established immediately and given deep personal weight. The pressure escalates effectively from intellectual curiosity to a physical, almost spiritual confrontation as she digs and the "gravity pocket was fighting her intrusion." The climax provides a resolution that doesn't erase the stakes but transforms them, with the cost of acceptance being palpable and well-dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—silencing a dangerous prophecy—and escalates the pressure coherently. The deepening of the conflict is visible as the summoner begins to "see the coded words" and the origami wing "trembled... where prophecy touched." The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the cost of his intense focus is made legible through the physical tension and eventual relief.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—understanding the buildings' language—is established immediately and intensifies effectively through the introduction of the seal. However, the conflict lacks a tangible cost. The "agreed upon lies" are mentioned but never dramatized, representing a significant missed opportunity to ground the stakes in real-world consequences or trade-offs, leaving the resolution feeling like a frictionless gift.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding her past to overcome isolation—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict escalates effectively under an Accumulative lens, as the ritual deepens the pressure and forces a crystallization of Elara's purpose. The cost of her new independence is made explicit and felt in her acceptance of the "weight and wisdom" of the archive.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake of redemption is established early and remains the focus. The arrival of the key provides a meaningful tightening of pressure, forcing Elias to move from passive penance to active choice. The resolution is driven by his agency, and the cost is legible as he prepares to face his past. The escalation feels somewhat low-friction, however, as the key appears without effort and works without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining the nexus's balance—is established early and is suitably high. The arrival of the child's echo provides a clear inciting incident. The conflict resolution, however, lacks weight because the promised opposition never materializes; the singer's compassion faces no true test or cost, making the victory feel too easily won.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—achieving justice to salvage purity—is signaled early and escalates effectively from a physical quest to a moral challenge. The key tightening occurs when Elara discovers the truth and must decide *how* to reveal it, a choice driven by her agency that directly shapes the outcome. The resolution is earned through her actions, and the cost, while handled gently, is legible in the descendants' need to absorb a difficult truth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative lens, the story successfully deepens its dominant stake, which is the philosopher's state of appreciative awareness. The pilgrimage to the parapet serves as the key intensification, reweighting his understanding of hidden patterns. While it lacks external opposition, the internal pressure to perceive and appreciate is consistent, and the "cost" is the acceptance of transience and solitude, which feels earned by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes escalate effectively, moving from an intellectual puzzle to a mission with world-altering consequences and immense personal risk. This deepening is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency in pursuing the truth, and the cost of her success is made explicit and felt by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story establishes a grand, philosophical stake: shaping a new dawn. However, this stake is never tested through direct, on-page pressure that forces Elias to risk something. The central conflict is between Elias's insight and the world's ignorance, but the resolution arrives as off-page news that simply confirms his victory without him having to act. Escalation is therefore minimal; the pressure deepens conceptually but not dramatically for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—bridging the generational divide—is signaled early and resolved with a clear, on-page outcome. The conflict is primarily situational, a societal malaise rather than an active antagonist, which fits the story's gentle tone. The poet's decision to infuse the sound with intention serves as a meaningful escalation, and the cost is his continued status as a necessary outsider, observing the connection he creates.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—protecting the artifact—is established immediately and tested under escalating pressure. The tightening is clear: the broadcast warning, the sight of the intruders' boat, and finally their footsteps overhead create a direct and tangible threat. The resolution is earned entirely through the protagonist’s agency and specialized knowledge, and the cost of his renewed, now-proven guardianship is legible in the story's final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, potent stake: the validation of the mapper's life's work as the catalyst for a revolution. Pressure builds effectively toward a single, meaningful intensification—the hum of the viaduct—which resolves the central question. The mapper's agency lies in their patient preparation, and the resolution feels earned within the story's internal logic, with the cost of long-term dedication being legible.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are effectively signaled, escalating from a routine investigation to a high-risk ethical choice. The discovery of the note provides a single, meaningful tightening that forecloses the option of a simple report and forces a difficult decision. The cost of this choice—her career—is explicitly stated, making the final moment of resolve feel consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes escalate effectively from a financial dilemma to a profound spiritual and ethical choice. The pressure is primarily internal but is well-catalyzed by Ms. Eleanor's presence, forcing a decision. The final renunciation—choosing to keep the heart broken—is a strong turn with a legible cost: he sacrifices the comfort of a memento for the burden of a reminder. The conflict's progression is solid and earns its quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—to ring the bell—is clear and consistent, but the conflict is more of a puzzle than a struggle. Pressure does not escalate significantly; the glider moves from one completed task to the next without opposition, setback, or a tangible sense of risk. While the internal drive is strong, the lack of meaningful obstacles or a difficult trade-off at the climax makes the resolution feel preordained rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth—is established immediately and escalates decisively. The choice to lie to access restricted files is a superb tightening point, creating a 90-second window of high tension with clear personal and professional costs. The resolution is earned directly from this high-stakes action, and the cost of becoming a fugitive is legible and consequential, making the conflict feel potent and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—saving the settlement—is established, and the conflict of reconstituting the crystal provides a clear goal. Pressure is applied through the "weighted breath before reply" to the skeptical elders, creating a single, meaningful tightening for the climax. However, both the "coming storm" and the elders' challenge remain off-page and abstract, slightly softening the immediacy of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elena's life and her relationship with the concept of "endings"—is established immediately and remains the focus. The pressure deepens effectively under the Accumulative lens, with Marcus's lines acting as key turning points that reframe Elena's perspective. The final choice to stay is a clear renunciation of her initial goal, and the cost (accepting life's complexity over death's simple peace) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—the protagonist's need to rediscover meaning in his loneliness—is clear and maintained. The conflict is entirely internal, and under the Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively through a series of reflections that re-evaluate his past and purpose. The final shift in perspective serves as a resolution, with the cost being the acceptance of a solitary purpose, which feels appropriately scaled to the story's quiet nature.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom before a "coming silence"—is established early and pursued with focus. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is handled effectively as an intensification of ritual power rather than a causal turn. The climax sees the line walker's agency achieve the goal, with the personal cost of isolation providing a clear, albeit conceptual, price.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear emotional stake: the successful transmutation of pain.

The final formation of the circle provides a meaningful culmination, paying a visible cost of shared vulnerability that feels proportionate to the story's scope.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a powerful, non-traditional conflict: a single individual's quiet struggle against cultural entropy. The stakes—the potential loss of humanity's entire linguistic structure—are immense. Under an Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens perfectly through a series of internal realizations, culminating in a re-weighting of his entire mission, which serves as a potent climax with a clear, felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—the prophet's internal struggle to experience a fleeting moment of profound connection before his memory fails—is clear and compelling. Pressure deepens effectively as he nears the source of the sound, culminating in a choice to resist his inherent forgetfulness. The cost is felt in the poignant, temporary nature of his victory, which is well-suited to the story's quiet, textural mode.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the observatory's physical survival—is immediately clear and sustained. The conflict deepens effectively when Elara reframes the problem from a structural failure to a perceptual one. Her final action provides a resolution earned through her unique agency, with the "luminous ache" serving as a palpable, non-physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—achieving a meaningful goodbye—and deepens the pressure effectively under an Accumulative lens. The arrival of the family and the son's poignant whisper, "I'll fix it, Dad," serve as a powerful intensification, heightening the tension between hope and reality. The protagonist's agency in continuing to play provides a bridge to acceptance, and the cost—death—is made definite and felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a strong, singular stake and escalates pressure effectively as Elara closes the energy loops. The climax delivers a decisive turn driven by her actions, which pays off the buildup of tension. The cost is conceptual but clear, transforming her worldview and foreclosing her original, simpler quest for a much larger, more perilous one.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Eleanor's need to resolve the mystery of Arthur and her own worldview—is signaled early and deepens effectively. The pressure escalates not through action, but through Eleanor's increasing commitment to a mystical path, culminating in a choice to abandon skepticism. The final resolution reconfigures the stakes from "rescue" to "co-creation" with a clear, felt cost, which is a strong turn for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    The central internal stake—reconciling a grounded reality with cosmic dreams—is established immediately and deepens effectively. The escalation works perfectly for an accumulative lens, where the intensification of her craft, rather than an external event, forces the final turn. The cost is legible in the acceptance that her original dream is gone, making her newfound purpose poignant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the protagonist's internal reconciliation—is established early and pursued consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant internal stake—artistic integrity versus external pressures and self-doubt. The pressure doesn't escalate through new events but deepens through accumulated reflection, which is appropriate for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—the loss of cultural memory—and a deadline with the harvest moon. The pressure, however, is conceptual and temporal, lacking on-page obstacles or opposition. The escalation is limited to Elara working "feverishly" without facing any setbacks, trade-offs, or difficult choices, which results in a low-tension narrative arc where the resolution feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes—the "hope of salvation" against an "encroaching void"—are cosmic, yet grounded in the delicate, high-stakes task at hand. The conflict is primarily the internal struggle for perfect focus against the external threat of entropy, which is a potent combination. The escalation is tracked beautifully through the growing "inner light" of the pattern, culminating in a single, decisive action where the price of failure is absolute. Agency is clear and the resolution is earned through skill and patience.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake—preserving generational memory—and effectively deepens the conflict under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—the weaver's internal struggle with their lonely calling—is established early and powerfully deepened through the ritual. The progression from the king's burden, to the farmer's, to the weaver's own, and finally to the lost civilization's creates a palpable increase in emotional and thematic pressure. The resolution is earned through the weaver's agency in completing the difficult ritual, and the cost is clearly legible.

    The internal conflict is rendered with subtle but undeniable pressure. The stake—finding a way to live with profound loss—is established immediately. The story's one meaningful tightening comes from the decision to contain her grief within the timeframe of the boiling kettle, a brilliant choice that makes the abstract concrete. The cost is beautifully articulated in the final paragraphs: she doesn't vanquish grief but accepts its transformation into a permanent, manageable presence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)

Cyrus's agency is demonstrated in the final choice to offer the wheel, a decision with a clear, felt cost that forecloses his decades-long obsession with capturing the past. The resolution is earned directly through this central action.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting a piece of the past to find hope—is established early. The physical conflict of repairing the power system provides a clear line of escalation toward the climax of throwing the switch. However, the resolution of the *thematic* stake is not achieved through her engineering but through the convenient discovery on the sextant. This disconnect between the physical struggle and the conceptual reward lessens the impact of the final earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—is clear and compelling. Pressure builds effectively through the accumulative power of setting and memory.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can find a foundational truth—is signaled early and coherently pursued. The discovery of the journal provides a meaningful deepening, shifting the stakes from a personal quest to a public responsibility. While the external pressure is low, the internal escalation is clear, and the cost is the "turbulent" weight of her new understanding, which is felt even if not yet paid externally.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story excels at dramatizing a quiet, internal conflict. The dominant stake is clear, and the pressure escalates through an act of endurance—the protagonist's sustained, silent attention.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central, internal conflict is established early and deepens effectively through the traveler’s empathetic projection onto the gardener.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is signaled early and tested through a single, meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake is clear, and the empty pedestal provides a solid tightening of the conflict.

The declared danger of the memories never materializes, representing a significant missed opportunity to test the stakes and the protagonist's commitment in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—the fate of the fledgling civilization—is clear and compelling. The conflict escalates effectively for an accumulative story through intensification of action and focus (the sonar pings, the gear's spinning) leading to a decisive climax. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution, and the cost, while conceptual (the burden of an eternal cycle), is felt and unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story's central stake—discovering and embodying the shape of collective grief—is established early and pursued with focus. The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, fitting the accumulative lens. The walk with the ribbon provides a meaningful deepening of the protagonist's understanding, and the cost is legible in the depletion of the heirloom ribbon. While it lacks sharp reversals, the escalating pressure is textural and leads to a cathartic, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—Alaric's need for absolution and the town's need for its center—are signaled early and effectively. The discovery of the final inscription provides a single, meaningful tightening that forces the protagonist into a difficult, character-defining choice. The cost of that choice is made visible through his emotional vulnerability, resulting in an earned and satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, internal stake—to discover past intentions—and deepens it effectively. The pressure intensifies texturally as the "uncharted echoes grew stronger," culminating in a revelatory turn that alters the character's knowledge. The cost is the loss of a simpler romantic interpretation for a more complex truth, a legible price paid for his discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes—community survival—are established early and remain dominant throughout. The pressure effectively tightens when Elara observes the "small cracks already forming," which validates her models and adds urgency. Her final action is a direct and agent-driven response to this pressure, paying a visible price by forcing her community to undergo a difficult but necessary transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict—the copyist versus the Narrative Control Bureau—is clear, and the stakes are high. The act of broadcasting provides a single, meaningful escalation of her commitment. However, the antagonistic pressure from the authorities remains an abstract, background threat rather than an immediate, on-page force. While her caution shows the stakes are felt, the lack of any near-miss or direct confrontation keeps the tension from reaching its maximum potential.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elena's internal quest for "safety" in a world of flux—is well-established. The conflict is primarily philosophical. The "tightening" is a superb example of a cadence shift under an Accumulative lens: the physical slowing of the rocking chair forces a crystallization of her internal stance. The cost is the poignant realization that her lifelong pursuit was based on a false premise.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—the preservation of knowledge against mandated ignorance—is established immediately and effectively. The discovery of the cog acts as a perfect tightening, forcing the abstract conflict into a concrete, internal struggle for the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: preserving cultural harmony against societal division. However, the conflict lacks on-page escalation; the choir's "hostility" and "tensions" are described in summary but never dramatized in a scene that forces Eleanor to make a difficult tactical choice. The progression feels like a smooth, inevitable success rather than a struggle against meaningful opposition, which flattens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's act of gentle rebellion—is clear and compelling within the story's quiet scope. Under the accumulative lens, the peaking of the celestial alignment provides a single, effective moment of intensification that raises the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.5)
    The stakes of the city-wide failure are clear, and the conflict escalates logically with the ascent. However, protagonist agency is weak; Elara's involuntary truthfulness makes her more of a plot device than a decider.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Aria's need to understand why some houses feel alive—is established early and pursued with agency. The discovery of the orris root shard provides a meaningful deepening of the conflict, focusing her methods and intensifying the potential for a breakthrough. The resolution is earned directly through her culminating action, satisfying the central stake.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear philosophical stake: whether the diver can overcome their rigid certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving that kindness is a universal language—is clear and maintained. The conflict is primarily internal and philosophical, and pressure escalates appropriately for an accumulative lens as the painter's "daydreams intensified." However, the resolution feels somewhat preordained; because her conviction is never truly challenged, her internal victory, while earned through labor, lacks the feeling of a hard-won struggle against genuine resistance or self-doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central conflict—cultural memory versus oblivion—is established early and escalated effectively. The dominant stake, rescuing the dying arts, is given visceral weight through the descriptions of the fading community.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.4)
    The external conflict is clearly established—a violent storm threatening the community—and the stakes are high. However, the resolution lacks tension because the protagonist's success feels predetermined and effortless. The price paid is abstract and perpetual ("never-ending" work) rather than a tangible cost incurred during the climactic confrontation, which diminishes the sense of a hard-won victory and makes the escalation feel somewhat procedural.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are signaled early and escalate powerfully from a personal mystery to a world-level responsibility. Kael's agency drives the escalation when he uses the whistle, and the resulting discovery forces a choice that forecloses his old path (escape, reunion) with a clear, on-page cost (the burden of knowledge). The pressure is coherent, and the resolution is earned through this decisive shift in understanding and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=3.5)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. While the historical stakes are clear, there is no on-page escalation of pressure or meaningful opposition.

The conflict remains abstract—a character against a static past—without a single turn that tightens options or forces a costly choice, resulting in a complete lack of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—harvesting potential to forge a new purpose—is clearly established and pursued. The ticking clock of the failing shields provides coherent external pressure, forcing the action forward.

The final choice to continue the hunt represents a successful resolution with the felt cost of his transformed grief.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding the frequency of belonging—is clear and maintained. The conflict escalates through the accumulation of data and technical challenges, fitting the story's lens.

This is a well-executed escalation for a story of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—a difficult prisoner exchange—is signaled immediately and effectively deepened into a more profound emotional conflict about releasing past resentments.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a powerful philosophical stake—the preservation of beauty against systemic decay—and effectively deepens it through an Accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)

    Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via breath pattern that narrows options to internal transformation. Agency is renunciation/acceptance with visible tear-dissolution as cost. Escalation is lyrical, not causal, but coherent under chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—tightens when the fragment traps Elara between moments. Each walk along a folded path raises the price of knowledge, culminating in bodily dissolution. Agency is present but abstract; the cost is felt yet not fully dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—save the seeds—escalates cleanly as the wall’s demolition clock ticks; the early arrival of the crew tightens options. Cost is felt (lost seeds, ongoing exile) but not viscerally on the page at the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through iterative failures and the cancer clock, culminating in the single decisive crystallization. The tightening forecloses mass production; the price is the knowledge itself. Agency remains with Kael throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—acquire moonbeams to decode the constellation—faces one clear tightening when the bouquet code buys entry, narrowing choices. Cost is recognized only after the theft; escalation is chiefly intellectual until the final lens flare instant.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—crafting safe zones for inquiry—is signaled early, but pressure escalates more through atmospheric accumulation than through narrowing options. The final image carries felt cost, yet the beat-to-beat tension remains low-grade.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—survival against The Production—tightens once when the decrypted cast reveals the meeting time is “dangerously near.” Agency is her decision to stand and wield vulnerability; the cost is the terror she must endure in that charged poise.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—origin of thought—tightens when protocol is breached; the cost is the forfeiture of external programming. One meaningful turn: the decision to surrender to music rather than analyze timelines. Pressure escalates under causal lens until the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure deepens steadily from curiosity to temptation to renunciation; the single dominant stake—whether she will keep the invasive lens—tightens meaningfully when the map ticket drives her to the hidden chamber; the price becomes visible on-page when she abandons the immediate panacea to risk slower trust-building.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—proving unquantifiable reciprocity—is signaled early and tightened once: the scientists’ visit forces Elias to crystallize his stance. No reversal, but the single deepening (embedding the cereus marble) forecloses any need to persuade outsiders. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the price is the garden’s eventual loss of its sole translator.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“prove time moves sideways”—is signaled early and tightened through each lever beat. Agency is high, but the visible price (risk to specimen? career?) is only implied, keeping escalation just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—finish the ghost’s song—signaled early. Escalation is accretive: stains → notation → performance → dissolution. One tightening beat: decision to play forecloses retreat and costs the program’s existence. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover the swallowed truth—tightens once: smudging reveals coordinates that foreclose lingering in safety. Cost is felt in the “shaking hands” and the night’s bite, but the price remains more atmospheric than visceral. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Singular stake—uncover the swallowed truth—is escalated through discovery of voice (radio confession) and culminating vision, then lands in acceptance. Pressure coheres under causal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—witness without succumbing to stasis—is signaled early and tightened once when the silence offers healing. The keeper’s renunciation carries conceptual cost, though the price is more abstract than visceral. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—releasing Lila’s voice—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each musical session fails until the eclipse offers a once-only acoustic hush. The cost is implicit but felt: Maya risks retraumatizing herself by replaying her own childhood loss. Agency is Maya’s decision to lead Lila to the ridge; coincidence (eclipse) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving stories before final fade—is signaled early. Escalation is gentle: each artifact deepens knowledge but never threatens immediate failure. No visible price is paid; tension remains atmospheric rather than tactical. One meaningful deepening occurs when dragons are linked to the axis shift.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—altering collective perception—stays abstract; no tightening beat forces a trade-off or visible price. Pressure is ambient (“thousands who read his words”) rather than immediate. No reversal or deepening narrows options; escalation is lyrical accumulation, not causal spike. Closure reconfigures meaning but lacks visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—save Sarah before integration—signaled early. Escalation is causal: each loop layer narrows the entity’s options. The rhetorical question “Can that which is eternal…” forces a visible falter; cost is the priest’s exhaustion and the entity’s dissolution. One tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transmuting memory into unheard music—tightens as dawn advances and exhaustion mounts. One meaningful intensification: the shell’s glow and spire’s vibration externalize the inner crescendo, forcing collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—self-acceptance versus freakhood—tightens as each timeline reframes his gift. One clear deepening beat: the convergence chamber forces a stance crystallization with visible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—exposing weather manipulation—tightens once when the message confirms conspiracy and forces Elias’s irrevocable act. Escalation is coherent under the Causal lens; the cost (personal peril, loss of anonymity) is legible on the page as he seals the tube with trembling fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—will Elias face or flee the sensory memories—tightens once, decisively, when the ultraviolet lantern forces confrontation. The cost is felt in real-time tears and the final act of display, which forecloses avoidance. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (how to live in altered time) coherent throughout; pressure deepens as rope pattern forecloses naïve choices; escalation subtle but unmistakable when every knot removes an exit timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: deliver authentic-seeming nostalgia without destroying client’s agency. Pressure tightens when Elias must “subsume the last remnants” of her original state—one decisive turn. Cost is ethical: he becomes complicit in emotional forgery. Escalation is steady under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: recognition of invisible labor. Pressure tightens when funding cuts threaten the archive; Elias’s offer narrows his own time/resources. The cost—Elias’s ongoing commitment to new cycles—is implied but not viscerally dramatized on page, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—belonging—tightens through the collaborative search; the sigil discovery forces a communal stance crystallization. Cost is felt in shared exhaustion and the irreversible alteration of the arbor. One clear escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore natural rhythm before the giant wakes—is signaled early and escalates via time-borrowing that visibly shortens the illustrator’s lifespan. One decisive tightening: shattering the cage at the cost of collapse. No reversals, but pressure is coherent and causal.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding loss via emotional mathematics—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the mosaic rearranges, but escalation is mild: options widen rather than narrow, and the cost is only potential hope. Agency is observational; no tangible price is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—how to help without exposure—tightens when the tape fragment offers a path; pressure rises through the recognition that the building’s failing power can be fixed by this relic. Cost is conceptual (perpetual hiddenness) rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—transforming trauma into testimony—is signaled early and tightened when Lena accepts the pigments, foreclosing her nostalgic attachment to the brooch. The cost (loss of talisman, responsibility for rare colors) is legible, though the escalation is gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—mastery over futures—signaled early and tightened by the pearl’s activation. Escalation is accumulative: each shadow inhabitation increases density until the final reconfiguration. Agency is present in Elara’s decision to touch the crystal, though the external antagonist (pilgrim) is off-stage. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of predictive certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“to transform fragments into community repair”—is declared, but pressure accrues gently; tightening comes once when Elina chooses to tell the herald’s truth at cost of possible discord. Cost is soft (“anger softening to sorrow”) rather than palpable sacrifice; escalation remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—access to unspoken truths—is signaled early and tightened when the vault begins to flicker, forcing Ethan to leave with only partial knowledge. The cost is the inability to remain; this felt forfeiture narrows options and sets up the iterative return. Escalation is coherent under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density of symbols increases until the stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal memory—signaled early. Pressure tightens as Elara moves from private transcription to public invitation; the cost is the exposure of her solitude, but the price is more asserted than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Signed early stake—“question that had haunted him since losing Elara”—ramps into spatial mutiny threatening all realities. One decisive turn: trading immortality’s safe isolation for active guardian duty, with sanctuary collapse as felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—her security vs. Thorne’s life—signaled early and tightened once: the moment she stamps the seal, the trade becomes irreversible. Escalation is causal and single-cycle; no reversals needed. Cost is legible: loss of job and possible charges. Coincidence is absent; every beat is earned by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.1)
    Single dominant stake—preservation of lost temporal textures—intensifies via escalating dawn stakes: another day conquered or lost. No external antagonist; pressure coheres in Elias v. entropy, with one meaningful tightening per dawn attempt. Decision to mountaintop renunciation of social future earns credible closure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—identity beyond documentation—is signaled early and tightens once through the realization that stories, not papers, constitute self. Cost is felt in the renunciation of official reclamation; pressure deepens via accretion of fragments rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the riddle—tightens when the compass stops and the astronomers’ unresolved debate is revealed. Escalation is driven by Evelyn’s agency: each bow stroke narrows options until she must choose synthesis over refutation. The cost is the acceptance of permanent uncertainty, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve culture vs. accept gentrification—tightens when corporate emissaries arrive; graffiti counter-proposals force a trade-off. Escalation causal: each encoded mural raises stakes until the dawn notice crystallizes partial victory with visible cost (Maya’s anonymity, chip relinquished).

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—document the last fireflies before extinction—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens once: sunrise is irreversible. Agency is endurance and precise action; the cost is the extinction itself and Elena’s solitary witness. No reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore the drone before the ship sails—is signaled early and tightened by the audible anchor lift. One meaningful deepening: the cracked sensor forces Elias to refine his water-refraction method under time pressure. Cost is the relinquishment of the drone and the unspoken farewell to his apprentice.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove the mythical source—intensifies through each leg of the journey. The falcon’s return and the dream condensation tighten the path, foreclosing retreat. Cost is intellectual and reputational rather than physical, but still legible. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—restoring Silverwood’s harmonic balance—is signaled early and escalates via each footfall + fork strike. Pressure tightens as discord dissolves and structures reassemble; the threat of collapse recedes. Agency is cumulative rather than confrontational; no single reversal, but a steady narrowing of decay. Cost is diffuse (his solitude, the town’s dependence on his ritual) rather than sharply felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the ephemeral before oxygen runs out—tightens through each beat; the alarm blares at the exact moment of commitment. Agency drives escalation: Elena’s decision to insert the vial triggers the door and the irreversible cost. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the rescue sub arrives only after the choice is sealed.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—threading his own story before discovery—is signaled early and tightens once through the decision to write on the walls; cost is implied but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake—settle the lifetime debt—escalates via accumulative resonance: bead strengthens her form for one harvest, each pulse widening cost of failure. Final release forecloses her remaining trace while birthing the impossible bloom, price paid on the page. No coincidences heal her; the new growth responds explicitly to her last full act. Pressure is coherent and intensifying under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“transform ruin into reverence”—is declared early, but escalation is narrated rather than tested through a narrowing choice. No on-page reversal or trade-off is dramatized; the village’s adoption is reported, not earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore lost faith—tightens through each recovered fragment; each groove rediscovered narrows the exile’s distance. Agency is continuous: Kaelen chooses to speak, to bring offerings, to place the bird. Cost is visible in the tears and the phrase “weight of exile lift.” One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.3)
    Conflict tightens around the need to deliver meaningful identity mail before noon; stakes escalate once—the act cements Elara’s own transformation—but lacks further narrowing of options under the single-beat scope.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing the coup—escalates cleanly from cosmic omen to embroidered interference. Pressure tightens when she deciphers the “scheduled accidents,” but the sabotage itself happens off-page, muting the felt cost at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single dominant stake: recover or renounce the apology. Pressure tightens once—spiral into the labyrinth’s heart—ending crystallized by the window’s apology/fear/fear/forgive cycle. One credible felt cost in the tear and pressing brow to glass.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is accrued rather than escalated causally: translator endeavors to graft meaning onto absence. Loss drives emotional stakes, yet the arc is deepening knowledge rather than narrowing options; single decisive crystallization qualifies closure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover lost joy”—is signaled early and escalates through each reveal, but pressure is external (council doubt, visitor wonder) rather than an internal trade-off; no option is foreclosed for Amelia herself.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—will Elena surrender her certainty?—is signaled early and tightens through each awakening. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than external threat; the nickel’s warmth and vibration mark visible price. The final choice forecloses her old method, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving inner defiance—is signaled early and escalates as surveillance adapts. The tightening comes when night-blooming cereus signals nationwide resistance, narrowing options toward the final phase; cost is implied but not yet viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—transform sleepless suffering into communal rest—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through blossoming coverage, but no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. Conflict remains abstract; poet’s agency is observational rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—preservation against forgetting—is signaled early and tightened when the crack silences names. Escalation is textural: each lost sound increases the caretaker’s urgency. Agency is present in the repair ritual, but the cost (time, emotional toll) is more asserted than felt on the page. No reversal beyond the tube’s restoration; the victory is bittersweet yet static.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing permanent division—is signaled in paragraph three and escalates via each translated promise that narrows the diplomatic window. The final tightening occurs when Elena realizes the ceremonial text’s consequences; the cost is the ink well’s exhaustion and her own exposure as “dreamer or savior.”

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—harmonize flood vs. heritage—is signaled early and tightened through each discovery. The seasonal-lake solution forecloses pure preservation with visible compromise; cost is felt in the relinquishing of either extreme.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering the lost songs—tightens through escalating pattern: meteorite as paperweight → map → ceremonial charm. Each beat raises the cost of remaining hidden. Agency drives every turn; coincidence never rescues. The final release crystallizes the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why thresholds feel sacred—tightens through each crossing; the oak doorway forces a decisive step with felt resonance. Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than external antagonist, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding cosmic belonging—is signaled early and tightened when the creatures mirror “The Belonging” constellation. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than external opposition; the cost is emotional surrender. Agency is present but interior; no tangible resource is risked or lost, keeping the escalation just shy of visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—why paths vanish—is signaled early and tightens once: the planted seed forces a redefinition of loss into transformation. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the visible price (emotional surrender) is soft rather than materially altering her next move.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—Leo’s wager that the woman’s evening may be redeemed—is signaled early and escalated by the on-page arrival of the music. Escalation is a single deepening: the woman’s “anniversary” breaks composure under the exact song Leo seeded. Cost is visible: relinquishing the bishop token publicly; however, the price feels self-defined rather than externally threatening, capping at upper strong band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preservation of memory—escalates through the act of inscription. One tightening beat: anchoring forecloses escape. Cost is legible (loss of mobility) but could be sharper on the page. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no false resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake — how daily craft will change — is fuzzy; no external pressure tests it. Prism appears and beckons but does not complicate or tighten options. Pattern break (stone-pond communion) provides the single cadence shift; escalation remains gentle-to-abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—translate private grief into shareable truth—tightens once via the ridge reflection that reframes the box. Agency is interior (renaming the box’s meaning) yet carries visible cost: acceptance of permanent scars. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“can hope be re-plotted?”—escalates as each pattern tightens the gauge’s range. Pressure stays coherent; no coincidence resolves the arc, but final cost is felt more conceptually than experientially.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes—preserve architectural memory—are signaled early and deepen with each artifact. Pressure accumulates but never forces a live trade-off; the ending is acceptance rather than narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—glimpsing possible lives—escalates through sensory intensification under the Accumulative lens. A single tightening occurs when the bells begin to toll, forcing the Painter to relinquish the visions. The cost is legible in the slowing heartbeat, though the price feels borne more by the terrace than by her.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will this treaty hold?—tightens once at midday when the first breach is bridged. Cost is implied (lifetime of solitude) but not dramatized on the page, keeping it just shy of 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—liberation from conformity—escalates through each loosened thread, tightening the emotional cost. One clear deepening occurs when the prism solidifies, forcing the choice to enter; the price is spiritual rather than material, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling vs. harmful narratives—is declared early but never sharpened onstage. No reversal or tightening occurs; the homeless stories persuade without resistance. Audience softening is reported, not dramatized. Cost is absent; tactics unchanged.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—honoring disappearing histories—tightens through the single monarch’s flight and the knowledge that the memorial will vanish by dawn. Escalation is accretive: each knot = one lost generation, density rising until the final image. Cost is felt in the dissolution of the structure and the implied future absence of both butterfly and witness. No external reversals, but the deepening is sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened when the rope’s glow demands her permanent service. One decisive turn: she reconfigures the braids, irrevocably binding herself. Cost is explicit in her tear-tracked decision to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.4)
    Storm-catalyst escalation is sensory and unifying; one meaningful pivot—dream-transcendence—that crystallizes “fate vs free will” with unmistakable cost of perpetual triple-vision burden.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the tile before Nebuchadnezzar arrives—tightens once when the equinox window narrows. Agency drives escalation; cost is the irreversible covenant etched into Anu’s hands.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—release resentment or remain fractured—is signaled early and tightened through each sanctuary pulse. The cost is visible: Marcus’s dark aura dissolves, leaving him exposed. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (brother’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recreate the vessel to decide whether to imprison or free the dream—tightens once when the maker chooses liberation. Escalation is accretive: each breath-sync beat intensifies the boundary dissolution. Cost is the irreversible redefinition of the sextant and the maker’s acceptance of perpetual service to others’ dreams.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—pursuit of forbidden knowledge—is signaled early and tightens once when the cameo activates. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; the tightening is the resonance spike in the Archive chamber. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly muting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (free trapped scholar) is signaled early; pressure tightens when guardians demand justification. Agency shown in renegotiation, but the beat is compressed, muting felt cost. No escalation after entry into the library; rescue itself is frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost identity—tightens when Elara realizes her purpose is to voice the forgotten. Pressure deepens via memory immersion, but escalation is more textural than causal; cost is felt yet diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent future temporal disturbances—emerges early and tightens as the celestial alignment window narrows. One clear escalation: the seal’s vibration forces Eleanor to decide whether to proceed. Cost is implied by Croft’s two-century absence; the merge forecloses her prior reality. Stakes could be more viscerally felt, but agency is intact.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.9)
    Central stake—save ancient ripple-marks from erasure— is clear and urgent. Conflict escalates via absorption of chaos into complement rhythm; agency is choice to harmonize, not defeat. One explicit turn (bloom of hush) suffices, but cost manifests as immutable transformation of artifact and duty rather than forfeited opportunity; felt price stays implied.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove coincidences have meaning—tightens through nightly charting and the decisive alignment. Escalation is steady but low-grade; no tangible resource loss raises the price beyond fatigue. The meteor revelation complicates rather than rescues, preserving agency.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving collective identity—is clear; pressure deepens through accumulating sensory density rather than causal reversals, culminating in a visible cost (the archivist stays below, alone). One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—continuation of her life’s work—tightens through the funding threat; the pause deepens rather than reverses. Cost is conceptual (embracing uncertainty) but not viscerally felt on the page; escalation is intellectual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—harvest the gilded hush—is signaled early and tightened by the one-hour gravity window; the cost is the irreversible exposure to open sky and the forfeiture of the doll’s comfort. Pressure escalates via altitude-specific silences rather than causal reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—delivering engineered solace—is signaled early and deepened through accumulating micro-effects on passengers. Yet the pressure curve is gentle; no option is foreclosed and the cost is atmospheric rather than tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.8)
    Tension grows with sunrise countdown and progressively narrowing options; the mural puzzle and elevator reveal tighten agency. No false luck—Elara alone peels layers and triggers the sequence. Cost is real (time, relinquishing personal dream), though escalation is smooth rather than sharply intensified.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve isolation vs. honor duty—tightens when the ring’s pulse forces a choice. One meaningful turn: the third knock forecloses retreat. Cost is the sanctuary itself, visible in the last paragraph. Escalation is causal and driven by her agency; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes are declared—turn past trauma into beauty—but never tested; no tangible cost or risk is attached to the descent. Pressure is static atmospheric wonder rather than rising opposition; coincidence (texts) drives every step. A single meaningful tightening or trade-off is missing, so escalation stays flat.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—“truth will end the dynasty”—is signaled early; once the hidden compartment opens, pressure relaxes because no further cost is imposed, capping escalation at a single reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Primary stake—“shape of possibility” sought and glimpsed—remains singular and tight. Pressure rises not through adversary but by escalating sensual cost: cold-light disorientation, unsnapped boundaries. Final choice crystallizes: he must leave changed or remain lost; foreclosed options feel tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: can Eleanor convert institutional detritus into human connection? Escalation occurs via the button’s mystery and Benjamin’s arrival, tightening her isolation into shared recognition. Cost is felt in the reopened ache of her own failed adoption.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve unedited histories—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: security triples, lagoon targeted at dawn. Mara’s agency drives every turn—reflection map, key insertion, data siphon. Cost is on-page: alarms, exile, lost sanctuary. No coincidence resolves; coincidence (puddle map) only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes are elegantly simple: one prophecy must be nullified before it speaks. One deepening beat—Ethan’s urgent intensified breath—tightens options under Accumulative pressure. Cost is implied in the earned silence; a stronger on-page forfeiture (risk of physical exhaustion, lost musical phrasing) could have pushed 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—decode the leaves to warn the dwellers—is signaled early and tightens when the moonstone appears, forcing faster pattern-reading. The cost is diffuse (bodily transformation) rather than a concrete forfeiture, so escalation feels atmospheric rather than crucible-level.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—control vs. harmony with uncertainty—is signaled early and tightened once: the compass’s refusal to settle forces Elias to abandon precision. Cost is visible (old identity forfeited). Escalation coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—the lost zodiac coin’s knowledge—is reweighted at climax when Elias forges a replacement instead of recovering original, narrowing options from external quest to internal redemption with visible price (flawed vs luminous).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing Thomas—escalates through each distorted note, narrowing to the cave confrontation. The cost is visible in Elias’s spent warmth and the absorbed shame inside the tooth, but the tightening beat feels gentle rather than irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode mercy’s calculus—tightens when the forest forces literal deciphering. One decisive turn: aligning strap with floor pattern. Cost is the ongoing exposure to trauma echoes; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—honoring silenced histories—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the fragment’s warmth near the painting forces the final unfastening. Cost is conceptual (accepting legacy) rather than tangible. Agency is present but abstract; no credible loss beyond symbolic transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“see versus engage”—is signaled early and tightens when he decides to raise the barrel instead of retreat. One visible cost: he forfeits the safety of mere observation, accepting permanent conduit status. Escalation is single-track but sufficient for 750-word scope; no reversal, yet option set narrows credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—compress eternity without losing the past—tightens when the bottled whisper destabilizes containment. One clear escalation: the seventh-day implosion forces Eldon to accept a living library. Cost is felt but could be more viscerally embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reimagining civilization to heal a violent dispute—escalates via symbolic intensification: the storm thickens, the mirrors are draped, the manuscript accumulates weight. One clear tightening: the act of writing forecloses Elias’s neutrality, charging the shard with new communal meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—“all music lost by midnight”—is signaled early and tightened by each chime. The covenant of rust supplies coherent pressure; Elias’s agency drives the escalation through resonance rather than coincidence. The felt cost is the stone’s earlier dimming and the bodily drain at climax, though the rust itself remains more atmospheric than tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—cross the boundary where rationality fails—sharpens after factory-closure clock. The physical descent tightens options; lagoon immersion deepens cost. Agency in stepping forward forecloses retreat with on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—artistic legacy versus personal disorientation—tightens once when visions force a reimagining. The deepening is clear, but the price (dead GPS renounced) feels external rather than extracted from her body.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—why flowers bloom at night—is signaled early and deepens through the glass revelation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the postcard redirects the quest, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth vs. being consumed by it—tightens when the seventh diary traps her in 1963. The pressure deepens as each parley with the lagoon exacts visceral memory-cost, but the external antagonist (archive secrecy) stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—reviving the town’s spirit—is signaled early; pressure tightens when Elior rejects the “false comfort” of wishes and commits to communal re-creation. The cost is implied (effort, risk of failure) but not dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve the city’s emotional patterns before predicted silence—is signaled early and deepens through the wax immersion beat; the prophecy tightens options without resolving them. Cost is felt in Elias’s racing heart and the irrevocable shift of vocation.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single dominant stake—touch the texture of time before death—is signaled early. Escalation tightens as each perfect placement narrows escape routes and invests more of her lifespan in the pattern. The cost—forever leaving the safe archive model—is dramatized on the last beat, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving the bell can out-detect modern systems—tightens once when Elias reroutes the trigger; pressure is coherent, cost is the risk of professional ridicule if wrong.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—finding strength in vulnerability—is signaled early and deepens through each star-empathy beat. However, escalation is gentle and abstract; no single tightening moment forces a trade-off with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—the preservation of silence as covenant—exerts quiet pressure from hive whispers onward. One definitive tightening: placing the box beneath the hive on the anniversary, forfeiting speech forever. Cost is legible as the reclaimed bee departs into air, leaving tongueless vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding time’s texture—tightens when Elara deciphers the capsule’s hidden layer; each decoded message forecloses ignorance and raises the cost of sharing knowledge. Agency is present but soft: she chooses to embed new messages, yet the price (eternal vigilance) is more implied than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—capture imperfect beauty—signaled early; pressure deepens via kite release, but escalation is observational rather than narrowing options. Cost is atmospheric, not visibly paid by the poet.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—awaken interspecies communion before death—is signaled early and tightens through each month’s labor. Agency is renunciation/creation rather than confrontation; cost (waning strength, completed circuit) is visible. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    Single dominant stake—understanding homecoming—is signaled early and tightened when footprints converge. Agency is mostly internal: deciding to follow, deciding not to deviate. Closure provides a legible reweighting, but no tangible external stakes or felt cost surface beyond attitudinal change.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore the concord via garden—tightens as each pod is spent; bird-call guidance forces real-time course changes. Cost is the irreversible depletion of pods and the coachman’s solitary life; no external coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve astronomical legacy—remains abstract; pressure intensifies elegiacally through ritual repetition rather than via narrowed options or felt forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—mend the fractured sky—is signaled in the opening line and tightened by each successive chess move narrowing the path. Agency is high: every swap is Kael’s decision under rising cost (air, cold, master’s judgment). The final tightening is the master’s injunction that forces conscious consent. Price is felt—time itself as irreversible currency—though the physical toll could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving small gestures against erasure—tightens when the single pawn appears, proving her method works yet underscoring the thousands she cannot save. The cost is legible as luminous absence, though the escalation is more accretive than sharply reversive.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake voiced early: “shape of home.” Pressure deepens through nightly seeding rituals, culminating in decisive reconfiguration. One tightening visible, no reversals. Cost is emotional forfeiture—former alienation—but paid in image rather than scene-level sacrifice, keeping upper band entry just out of reach.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens as each decoded thread forecloses denial. The thunder-clock forces acceleration, turning reflection into urgent action. Cost is legible: forty years of silence paid for one chance at redemption.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—subvert the ritual—is signaled early and escalates through nightly sessions that grow “louder, more persistent.” One meaningful tightening: the Overseers’ shadowing narrows her options, forcing the dawn climb. Cost is felt but generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—conjuring meaning from oblivion—tightens through each traced scar, deepening the cost of remembrance. Agency is exercised in the act of narration itself, which progressively forecloses the option of forgetting. The price is felt as the workshop literally tilts, but the escalation could be sharper if one scar triggered an irreversible consequence on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving beauty against time—is signaled early and tightened by the shell’s reappearance. One meaningful deepening occurs: the realization that “temporary eternity” is achievable, narrowing Elias’s options to painting the masterpiece. Cost is visible in his trembling recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—prove whispers can reach the lost sister—is signaled early and tightened through the single decisive act of whispering into the cork. Agency is Elias’s; coincidence (sister happens to be a fisher in a distant village) complicates but does not resolve—the emotional confirmation still hinges on his purified intent. Cost is visible in the irreversible shift from private dream to public role. No escalation beyond this single beat, yet the deepening is sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—guiding reverse migration—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the midnight call orders “Build the bridge between tides.” Agency is navigator’s configuration of signals; cost is the censer’s near-burning heat. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—psychological safety—signaled in paragraph three and escalates through each named person, tightening empathic pressure. The second eye’s appearance forces a trade-off: keep isolation or share healing. Cost is the end of absolute solitude; the storm’s clearing externalizes the shift. One decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—decode stranger’s gesture—tightens once when Elias realizes it is an offering, not a warning; agency is renunciation of the flower with visible cost: surrendering the last relic of another life.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—will Elias continue to live vicariously through other people’s maps or author his own?—is signaled early and culminates. Escalation is a single smooth rise, not a reversal; one tightening moment (his selection of a doorway) forecloses retreat with felt personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    Bleeding starlight heights escalation by making the choice to embrace or resist cosmic burden, with cost traced to the altered reflection in the pool.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—how to capture transformative moments—is signaled early and deepens when the secret forces Elara to revalue her art. Escalation is textural: heat, light, and emotional density accumulate until the final stance crystallizes. Cost is conceptual (loss of prior method) but less viscerally felt than the pressure suggests.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—make narrative sense of chaos—tightens when the scroll activates and Elias must decide to continue chronicling. Escalation is textural (glow, aurora, dissolution) rather than causal, but the lens permits this. Cost is conceptual (accepting endless recursion) rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake of “restore missing human stories” is signaled via the birthing clamp. One deepening occurs: the screw returns, tightening Lena’s dependency and reweighting Elara’s vocation. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transform personal scars into living warnings—signaled early. Pressure escalates via the approaching storm and internal crystallization risk; the final rune completion forecloses the option to keep her own pain private. Cost is the quill’s spent tip and permanent bodily record.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology before orchard falls—escalates as the generator’s hum grows louder and Beatrice’s form solidifies. The tightening beat is Eloise’s decision to increase the rheostat despite risk of scattering the energy; this narrows options and raises cost. The price is the incomplete reconciliation symbolized by the unfinished composition. No reversals beyond the single, sufficient turn.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reintegrate cosmic fragments before the hiccup ends—is signaled early and tightens through the witness’s wanderingly exact steps. The final unification forecloses any further revision, with the cost legible in the witness’s solidifying form and the library’s dissolution into “completion.”

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—“what do clocks really measure?”—is signaled early and escalates via the literal reversal of flow. The tightening is a deepening of meaning rather than narrowing of options, fitting the Accumulative lens, though visible price is more conceptual than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—security vs. connection—tightens through each laser pulse and mirrored gesture. The permeable barrier forces a trade-off: maintain absolute defense or risk openness. The cost is the relinquishing of total control, dramatized in the dawn encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from academic curiosity to existential wager: reconciling probability and fatalism, cost = her father’s unfinished life. One deepening only—sequence turns into mirror of her private research—yet enough pressurized coherence under accumulative lens. The final stance narrows her future actions permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s vow of silence versus the need to teach endings—tightens once when the disc’s hum compels him to answer Meredith.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—loss of analog purpose—is signaled early and escalates through each preparatory beat. The act of sealing the vial is the decisive tightening that forecloses any return. Cost is visible and felt; no external coincidence intrudes.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—curing his own loneliness—escalates through each rumor vector; the cost is the exposure of his hoax and the surrender of credit. One tightening beat suffices, but the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=4.8)
    Dominant stake (navigate inward grief) is signaled early. Pressure escalates only through an external trail of notes rather than narrowing options within Elion’s internal conflict. Final choice (kneeling, absorbing understanding) resolves a quest the trail solved for him; agency muted.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing her past error without erasing it—is signaled early. Escalation is subtle but coherent: one tightening beat (writing the note) narrows future possibilities. Cost is conceptual—permanent uncertainty—rather than visceral, yet still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into music—is signaled early and deepened through each mapping. Yet pressure is atmospheric, not tactical; no narrowing of options or visible price paid on the page. Escalation is lyrical accumulation rather than conflict-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“rescue a forgotten promise”—is signaled early and tightened when the portrait’s restoration forces Maya to confront her past. Escalation is causal: each artwork narrows options until the final tapestry forecloses hiding. Cost is the irreversible self-reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the shared dream against erasure—tightens when Elena engineers the four-minute blackout and risks everything to reach the tower. The price is explicit: “this was temporary,” yet the act forecloses her former passive endurance.

    Dominant stake—proving whispers beat shouts—is signaled early and tightened when Marlo positions himself at the junction. The storm and blackout raise cost, but the final victory feels frictionless; no tangible loss is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will the unspoken secret rupture the ritual?—is signaled early and tightens through each shutter click. Escalation is accretive: patterns grow denser, stillwater tension mounts, visitor’s step forward/back reveals cost.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Central stake is freeing children’s imagination versus town’s rigidity; displays create visible tightening as town discourse blooms. Cost measured in Arthur’s continued silence and the risk his gift exposes. Single decisive reconfiguration about chess itself, not plot.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape from dock-bound expectation—is explicit early; whale call tightens the noose to “detach or remain inert.” Each scrim shard lost is a visible toll narrowing her path. Cost is body-weight lost to water when the last piece dissolves. One coherent escalation under cumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—freedom to transcend artistic limits—is signaled early and tightened when the poet physically merges with shadow/light. One meaningful deepening: the ban’s lifting is not enough; the poet must dissolve bodily boundaries. Cost is conceptual (loss of singular self) and legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—beauty in imperfection—escalates through each added stem until the courtyard’s shimmer forces a collective pause. Agency rests in Elara’s silent arrangement; the cost is Gideon’s relinquished craft and her own unnoticed sensory flood. One tightening beat suffices; coincidence (color return) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the texture of connection—is declared early but never tested by a narrowing choice. Pressure remains atmospheric; the resonance of miners’ voices deepens texture yet does not force a trade-off or renunciation. Escalation is accretive rather than decisive; no option is foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming grief into guidance—is signaled early and reiterated. Pressure deepens via nightly repetition and visitor need, but no single beat forces a trade-off or irreversible choice; escalation is accretive rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    After Yang’s arrival, the pressure doubles and the collaboration tightens the method once; the cost appears when Elias stakes his legacy on a joint map, foreclosing solo secrecy.

    Dominant stake—understanding the shadow to preserve hope—is signaled early and tightens when the shadow reveals the lost friend, forcing Elara to accept luminous regret as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—how to trust again—tightens once: from shattered conviction to conscious choice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—mapped mind vs. unmapped consciousness—signaled early.

Final acceptance forecloses exploration passivity but exact cost remains conceptual rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    One dominant stake—locating dormant courage—is coherent and steadily deepened. Agency remains gentle and poetic rather than urgent; the pressure curve flattens rather than spikes. Cost is visible (lifelong vigil with dragon weight) but lacks visceral teeth.

    Dominant stake—safety vs. voice—is signaled early and tightened when the bolt reveals the price of silence. The final choice forecloses lifelong sanctuary with the first sung note. Escalation is causal: each tactile discovery narrows options until only song or eternal silence remain.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—why paths disappear—tightens through each data overlay until the final reconfiguration. Pressure is coherent but largely observational; agency is limited to logging and realizing.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the goddess-echo—is signaled early and tightens once when the constellations stir; the fisher’s agency (zigzag, voicing silence) forces the decisive moment with visible cost in the altered garden and humming spike.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—clearing Davies and exposing the real culprit—escalates through Eleanor’s single night of deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim authentic agency after betrayal—is declared in line 10 and tightened twice through method escalation. Stakes escalate as each code drawn narrows available alibis and forces an on-page choice: keep old spy habit (photograph as passport) or risk vulnerable self-liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)

    Dominant stake—humanity’s perception—signaled early and tightened when she risks rupturing equipment and drawing alien notice. One decisive escalation: the transmitter fires, the signal dies, the town begins to heal. Cost is implied in the “ethereal grit” moment.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freedom from subterranean prison—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates as the portal’s cost (pain, forfeiture) becomes visceral. One tightening: the fallow period’s dormancy narrows the window, forcing irrevocable choice. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (unexpected two-moon realm) but does not resolve. Cost is on-page: locked muscles, dropped compass.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—solve the cold case—is signaled early; pressure tightens as ribbon analysis narrows suspects, but the final narrowing to the assistant feels compressed and the cost is not dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to risk activating ancestral tech—tightens once when the panel responds. Pressure escalates via Eli’s trembling hand and Dr. Aris’s skepticism. Cost is visible in the “overwhelming responsibility” that replaces dread.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will accept the impossible invitation—locks early, tightens as the scaffold map unveils, and pays out when he steps onto it. Micro-turn: recounting aloud shifts wrap-movement from passive to guiding. No redundant reversals; pressure deepens through image density. Cost: irrevocable surrender of empirical certainty, visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—decode inscriptions to recover lost healing—signaled early. Pressure tightens once star-glyphs appear; collaboration becomes the only viable path. Cost is the relinquishing of sole authorship over her gift. No external antagonist; conflict is internal and epistemic, resolved through shared labor.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—free mentor—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each expanding circle deepens density until the sixth reveals the frozen confession. Cost is the druid’s blood and the plant’s death, visibly paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake = restoring the covenant; signaled early: “must heed the whispering winds.” Pressure is coherent yet singular; no secondary reversal complicates. A meaningful tightening occurs when the visionary recognizes the covenant’s reframed purpose—this narrows the remaining path and carries cost, though the cost is lightly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mending a torn soul—signaled early and tightened once when the specter fights return. Escalation is accretive: each symbolic gesture (card, roots, whispered symbols) increases pressure until the memory yields. Cost is visible in the card’s added weight and Elara’s solitary vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—plant the seed to reach the arbor—tightens once: from scholarly decoding to embodied journey. The cost is the inherited burden and the risk of madness, but it is more asserted than viscerally staged; still, the boarding beat narrows her path irreversibly.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder through cyclical self-dissolution—is signaled early. Escalation is atmospheric rather than tactical; the rising tide tightens the ritual frame but does not force a visible trade-off beyond poetic acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake teardown of isolation versus suffocating hush escalates through pearl absorption of hopes. Two causal turns: descent narrows option; confession flow tightens choice and forces renunciation of inspector role.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake – self-forgiveness – is signaled from the first paragraph. Tightening occurs mid-scene: once the graffiti maps converge with Elena's professional knowledge, the only live option is literal descent to the diverted river. Cost is not just emotional but practical—she abandons the managed safety of medication for unpredictable currents, a visible tradeoff shown on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—access the library before closure—signals early and tightens once when the watch vibrates urgently. However, the protagonist’s agency is largely observational; the final step away is a renunciation without visible trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—time until empire confiscates violin—raises pressure; protagonist’s propagation tactic is a decisive narrowing of options that forecloses hiding. Empire remains off-page so conflict pressure is concept more than embodied threat, shaving off top end.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve the spark before oblivion—is signaled early and tightened as the static resolves into coherent memory. Agency is renunciation: she completes the capture yet must relinquish the living body. Cost is felt in the vial’s weight on the shelf, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the source of contentment—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Elara removes the hairpin and sees etched histories, realizing she must embody, not locate, peace. The cost is conceptual (she forecloses further seeking) but not viscerally felt. Agency is present; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—how to advise the fisherman—tightens once when Elian interprets the chimes and prescribes mercy over accusation. The cost is Elian’s accumulated emotional load, but the fisherman’s off-stage compliance lessens visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“to teach vanishing to appear”—is signaled early and tightens once when Maya demands revelation. The deepening trance and glowing grotto escalate pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Elien’s decade returned, Maya’s form fading. No coincidence resolves; agency remains with mentor and student.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—learn to navigate without moving—is signaled early and tightens through layered sensory pressure. The crows’ arrow formation and the arrowhead’s activation provide a single meaningful deepening that narrows options, though the cost is more metaphysical than tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recover wonder versus conform—is signaled early and tightened once: unstrapping the Pack forecloses safe return to automated magic. Cost is visible in the spire’s subtle transformation and the weekly gatherings that risk censure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—why he alone hears color—tightens when the librarian demands acknowledgment. Agency: he chooses to accept stewardship, paying with anonymity and a shimmering palm. Pressure escalates via the key’s rising heat and the sky lanterns’ chromatic echo. Cost is felt but abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would lift this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—determine rebirth vs. witness death—ratchets with each shrinking light-second. Tightening is single: realization spiral replaces annihilation with fold. Coin formation forecloses prior dread, cost is the unknowable new universe, felt in Korin’s hush and Loran’s tremble.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transform nameless dread into bearable form—escalates via iterative naming. One meaningful tightening occurs when “Lost Hope” is named; pressure deepens but never threatens the reaper physically, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring cosmic balance via the bell—is signaled early and tightens through the mage’s obsessive counting of drips; the final toll forecloses the era of silence. Cost is legible but abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—truth versus complicity—is signaled early; the resurfacing town tightens the moral pressure, forcing Thomas’s decisive action. Cost is visible in the phone calls and the relinquished quiet life.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightened once when the starlings’ pattern crystallizes the method; the cost is conceptual (irreversible shift in worldview) but less viscerally felt than ideal for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve trust under pressure”—is signaled early and tightens once when anomalies contradict patterns, forcing the midnight transmission. Cost is visible in the solitary vigil and the dread-laden voice that “belied complexity.” Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—free duplicate consciousness—tightens mid-story as the temporal wave forecloses options; the protagonist’s agency (channeling vitality) drives the decisive change. Escalation is cumulative, ending with perceptible cost: her numbness expires, history remakes. Comb resolves earned. Simultaneous internal/external stakes interweave cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake— safeguarding room for innovation— is clear early; small deepening arrives when Elara realizes she must protect her creative process long before the flower blooms. On-page cost is conceptual (forgone commercial timelines), slightly abstract for 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—faces one decisive test: can sound resurrect memory? Escalation is tonal density; each modulation tightens the emotional vise until the giggle offers a momentary loosening that still costs hope. No external reversals, but the internal pressure peaks with the echo. Agency is in the modulation, not external events.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transform exile into belonging. Escalation is textural—pendant’s warming, roses’ color shift, mist thickening—culminating in the porous boundary that forces the guardian’s stance crystallization. Cost is legible: loss of fixed identity and place. Agency is active (drawing energy, stepping forward) rather than passive waiting. Could edge higher if the homesickness itself exacted an additional on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny—signaled early and tightened through each failed approximation. Agency is visible: Elias chooses creative destruction, pays with ancestral relic and identity. Escalation is incremental but legible; the third attempt succeeds because he fully embraces dissolution. Cost is felt in the final image of a “living staff” that severs the past.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode the lunar signal or fail—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: silence achieved via shard of hush enables reception. Cost is the towers’ temporary awakening followed by inevitable return to slumber; agency is Elara’s deliberate tuning.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—unifying fractured timelines—signals early and tightens once when the parallel ferry appears. The merging act narrows Liam’s future to permanent transit, a visible price. Escalation is lyrical rather than causal, but pressure remains coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reach the lost sister—tightens when threads erupt, but escalation relies on collective unconscious rather than Elias’s agency; cost is felt but diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving starlight navigation from the abyss—is signaled early and tightens through iterative observation sessions. Agency remains Kael’s; the breakthrough is externally validated yet still reweights options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening the peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protecting the child—emerges at the first frantic pulse and tightens with each step toward the garden. Agency is Elena’s: she decodes the warning, confronts the situation, and acts. Cost is the belated realization that her grandmother’s last sight was a failed rescue attempt. One clear escalation beat suffices under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—guiding the unremembered before the tide returns—is signaled early and tightened by the literal 42-minute clock. Agency is clear: Elara chooses to continue rather than escape. Cost is implied (lost career, perpetual return) but not viscerally felt on the page. Escalation is steady, not steep, yet coherent under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—wisdom from system failure—is signaled early; pressure tightens via ink-pattern revelation, but escalation is more intellectual than visceral, lacking a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preventing total language extinction—intensifies with the death of the last native speaker and the tightening of time. One deepening suffices: the irreplaceable bird pattern he has never seen, compelling a final ritual. Stakes land as visceral ache, not abstraction. Cost rendered on the page: weeping and skin’s deepening grooves.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will Aris expose or protect the cryptids?—tightens when celestial patterns imply irreversible change. No single reversal, but pressure accrues: each sighting raises the cost of revelation. The cordless-phone confessions externalize risk without resolving it, sustaining tension.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (restore wonder) escalates through beat-for-beat tests: statues’ censure, tree’s consent, escaping guardians, dawn deadline—each tightening narrows options until bridge becomes hybrid cradle; cost is felt at each step.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reuniting mother and daughter via forbidden mail—tightens once: the bottle hand-off forecloses Elias’s neutrality and risks exposure under guard gaze. Escalation is causal: ledger → blind-spot map → timed drop → brush of hands. Cost is the immediate danger and the future promise to smuggle the mother herself. No reversals needed; single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming voice—signaled early and tightened once through song’s risk. Escalation is textural: silence thickens until song fractures it. Cost is emotional exposure; no external antagonist needed. Agency is renunciation of muteness, not victory over foe. Could use one more tangible forfeiture to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to reawaken dormant stories”—is signaled early. Escalation occurs via the scarf’s unraveling and the geometry’s glow, tightening toward the irreversible transfer of memories. Cost is felt in the scarf’s dissolution and Margaret’s tears; agency remains hers.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering the lost sister via light-cipher—is clear early. Escalation is one deepening: realization that presence, not recovery, is the path. Cost is conceptual (acceptance of absence) rather than viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing the imprisoned idea—tightens through ritual escalation; the cost is the dissolution of the lock of hair, a visible forfeiture that forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: transmitting resilience under exile’s stigma. Tightening occurs when Prisha’s refusal to retreat proves the lesson; cost is the archivist’s permanent outsider status. Pressure escalates through the shard demonstration and her steady annotation, foreclosing return to the Royal Archives.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the color of wonder”—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: surrendering part of herself to charge the seed. Cost is legible on page; pressure deepens through pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate because every loosened knot tightens future silence; pressure coheres and a final single beat crystallises the spirits’ grounding. No off-stage rescue—choices are Elena’s own, earned.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reopen the henge’s secret—tightens once via the celestial pattern discovery, foreclosing physical reopening in favor of experiential understanding. Cost is conceptual but legible: Elara forfeits the prestige of a mapped revelation for shielded openness. Agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the last transmission—tightens through iterative listening and globe scrutiny until the single word “home” reframes the conflict from rescue to metaphysical transition. Pressure is internal but coherent; the cost is the melancholy recognition that closure means relinquishing the search. One clear deepening, no reversals, fits length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—mutual articulation of unspoken needs—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through each graffiti exchange, but escalation is more textural than causal; no single beat narrows options with visible cost. Agency is diffuse; the ghost’s loneliness complicates but does not force a decisive trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.8)
    Central stakes of uncovering hidden grief are clear; pressure stays atmospheric rather than tightening, and the diary’s secrets resolve without measurable pivot or cost to Elira.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (prove atmospheres remember) tightens as each cloud emotion becomes evidence; the final dialogue between formations is escalation that reprioritizes life-risk against proof. Cost is felicitous—potential free-fall for validation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure tightens from gentle exploration to frantic dawn etching; each beat costs: stolen coin, broken plaster, burnt fingers. Stakes pivot from salvaging sky to immortalising essence as the bulldozer noise rises. A single choice—press pattern into clay before destruction—makes the decisive change without external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—charting discovery—is signaled early and tightens once when Eli deciphers the pattern; the cost is conceptual (his isolation may end) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure mounts organically around “can the rhythm of repair be felt?”—a single tightening toward empathy-driven restoration that forecloses easy exploitation of magic gears.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—save the failing crops—is signaled early and tightens once when Aris unearths the bell. Collective effort escalates under Accumulative lens, but the cost is communal rather than personal; no single character forfeits anything tangible, softening the final pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—the clock’s count toward obliteration—tightens across nested whispers until final hush ingests lullaby. Escalation is density-accumulative, not causal reversal; each sigil, breath, hummed fragment layers tension. Cost paid: Elias’s exhaustion and spindle glow register as felt price. Causality left intact, no rescue coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—save travelers before lethal frost—is signaled early and tightens with each tick of moonrise. Escalation is causal: each impression Elias leaves narrows his remaining time and energy. Cost is visible—spent nut, physical exhaustion, risk of mechanical birds. One tightening turn suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—repairing the ruptured sister bond—is signaled by the chrysalis trigger and tightens when Elara kneels to trace foam; the phone call crystallizes her stance with visible emotional cost. Pressure escalates via pattern deepening rather than multiple reversals; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding where stories begin—tightens once when the vendor realizes absence is the source. Pressure grows through the parole ritual’s nightly cost and the failed visitor breach; no external coincidence resolves anything. The final act of incising the door crystallizes stance with visible cost (parole limits). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transform remorse without being destroyed by it—tightens once when Kael kneels and lets the tide of regret enter him. The pressure is coherent, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal; the single beat of “subsumed” is summarized, not tested under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—community reconciliation—is signaled early and escalates through the revived talks. However, the decisive tightening (farmers and townspeople jointly rebuilding bridges) is reported in summary, blurring the felt cost. Pressure is coherent but never sharp enough to force a trade-off on Elena herself.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Inward pressure intensifies as each memory layer costs cognitive coherence; stakes shift from technological success to existential survival, one tightening choice at a time, paced under an accumulative lens that forces renunciation rather than victory.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—renewing vigilance against approaching darkness—is signaled early and tightened by the one-hour clock. Agency is decision and endurance: Elara chooses the final combination, accepts the irreversible awakening of seeds, and races the clock to escape. Cost is visible in the seven-minute countdown and the weight of future cycles.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—“restore music”—starts early and tightens when Elara learns the sculpture’s sorrow. One deepening occurs: the first vibration of sorrow makes any full restoration painful yet unavoidable, trading nostalgia for present grief. Agency remains hers—she initiates the strum, absorbs the crack-music, then chooses to carve again. The cost materializes as tears staining raw cheeks; no external savior resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—redemption before realignment—is signaled early and tightens via the three-day clock. Escalation is accretive: each magnetic pulse mapped to a chess move increases the conceptual cost. The final recognition narrows options to acceptance, with the felt price of permanent exile transmuted into apprenticeship.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unlock empathy via diary—tightens through rising sonic density. No external antagonist; pressure is internal and aesthetic. The final click resolves the surface conflict but leaves the deeper cost of empathy unexploded on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unlock the seed’s secret—tightens once when the moonlit opening forces Elara to revise her entire aim. The cost is the surrender of sole ownership of knowledge. Pressure is coherent but single-turn; no secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (“source of resilience”) is declared early. Pressure mounts via inversion clock but actual escalation depends on external phenomena—arrow tip glow, echoes delivering lore—rather than protagonist choices driving cost or narrowing options. The cost of discovery is offloaded to the arrow’s lore dump rather than dramatized sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—understand the silence—stays abstract; pressure intensifies only as data anomalies, not as narrowing options or visible price. Escalation is informational, not tactical. No reversal or trade-off occurs; Elena’s agency remains observational throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Primary stake—“certify wonder as essential to a numbed world”—escalates after each note locks another sensory layer; silence becomes weapon and gift. No slack reversals; cost tightens when prior peals eliminate escape, the final chord an earned renunciation of mere beauty in favor of transmissible silence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—redeeming failure through insight—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as each melody reveals a new layer of guilt; the final silence forecloses the path of self-recrimination. Cost is visible in tears and the relinquished driftwood.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need for fresh emotional data—is signaled early and tightened when Thomas arrives. The single meaningful escalation occurs when she activates the transfer, narrowing Thomas’s agency and foreclosing his trust. Cost is legible in his disorientation and flight, though the price to Elara herself remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver the pendant before solstice—tightens once when the shortcut is revealed via extended encounter. The cost is felt in Ayla’s relinquishment of the artifact and identity, but the escalation is more lyrical than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—validate that objects absorb emotion—escalates from abstract theory to visceral memory archive; one decisive tightening occurs when memories play across frost, forcing Elara to reframe her quest. Cost is intellectual and social rather than physical, but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring sound to a silenced world—is signaled early and escalates through each vanished noise. The puzzle-path sacrifices provide a meaningful tightening: each memory given narrows Elara’s remaining self. The cost is visible (memories lost, bead extinguished), but the external pressure remains somewhat abstract, limiting the visceral punch required for the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—transform destruction into resilience—tightens when elders bring fractured supports; each hammer blow narrows Orion’s anonymity until only public responsibility remains. Cost is visible: the silk’s energy “cold and burning” marks irreversible bodily change. No external coincidence resolves the conflict; the final stance crystallizes under earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the withheld truth—is signaled early and reiterated, yet pressure escalates only by assertion (“each journey expanded perception”) rather than on-page narrowing of options. The red-shard beat offers a micro-turn, but the cost is potential, not paid. Escalation remains atmospheric rather than causal under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—lonely custodianship versus inherited fellowship—tightens when the lamp dies and the hidden archive is revealed. One clear escalation: the discovery forces Elias to choose between silent routine and active guardianship of the chain. Cost is the emotional exposure of writing his own letter.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—safeguard refugee fleet—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: accidental prophecy raises stakes, forcing Elara to trust ancient manuscripts. Cost is communal (fleet survival) more than personal; her own risk remains abstract. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens, but personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—how to magnetize stories—is signaled early; pressure tightens as failed dye trials accumulate, forcing the breakthrough mixture. Cost is visible: Kaelen withholds the formula, accepting perpetual solitude atop the rock. Agency is present, though the final renunciation is compressed into one sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“restore balance of light and dark”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as the keeper exhausts personal memories to finish the weave. Cost is legible (loss of self-memories), but escalation is more lyrical accumulation than causal narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to honor connection or solitude—tightens once when midnight arrives and she writes the note. Agency drives the escalation; no coincidence resolves it. Cost is visible: forfeiture of communal belonging. One clear deepening suffices; pressure coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering why the bakery vanished—tightens once when the letter reweights the moral calculus. The escalation is textural: each sensory layer (bread smell, rain, garden growth) intensifies the cost of knowing. Agency is Eliza’s decision to read aloud and later to relinquish the bread.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the vows—is signaled early and tightens when Elias realizes reinforcement is possible. The pressure deepens through pattern of diminishing light, but the cost of the new work is stated rather than shown, muting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—record betrayal before sunrise—tightens with each rumor; the lie about patrol schedules is the single meaningful escalation that fractures the truce. Cost is legible: alliance shattered, shots imminent, Eliza’s exit marks irreversible change. Agency drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    One clear stake signaled early—will the skeptic accept weather-carrying? Middle tightening arrives when the compass burns and salt tears foreshadow intimate cost. Convergence choice reconfigures identity under live forest vote; price is fusion, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uncork suppressed creativity—signaled early and tightened when the cleaning woman’s discovery forces confrontation. One meaningful escalation: the moment Rhodes lifts the canvas and chooses to repaint under mineral glow, foreclosing the path of external validation. Cost is the irreversible staining of fingers and the acceptance of lifelong memory’s burden.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost conversations—is signaled early and tightens when the map reveals candor-gated routes. One clear deepening: realizing the journey itself must be truthful. Cost is conceptual (permanent exile from tolerated lies) but less viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder via resonant light—is signaled early and escalates through each tuning session. One meaningful tightening: the fragment never dims, forcing Elara to sustain the spectrum even as her body fails. Cost is felt in her aging hands, though the final price is more elegiac than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation rides coherent pressure: failing shield → rose wilt → Unit 734’s single irrevocable turn. Each beat deepens cost and forecloses staying whole; loss scales smoothly from abstract dome to thousand fragments—no slack beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.9)
    Single stake—healing through listening—tightens as demolition notices loom. Escalation is textural: memories accumulate until the mailbox delivers catharsis. Cost is communal, not personal, keeping it below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate the lab’s knowledge—is signaled early and tightened through escalating dance sequences. Pressure grows under an Accumulative/Textural lens, but the felt price (loss of privacy? exposure?) remains abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—locating deleted memories—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when the coffee-ground pattern points to the beach. The meaningful deepening occurs when Elara realizes she can only commune, not retrieve; this narrows her future path with the cost of perpetual visitation. Agency is hers throughout (digging, re-burying, choosing to map pockets). Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; coincidence (whale beaching) initiates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—is signaled early and escalates through intensifying quiet rather than external opposition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wing begins to interface with the unseen, narrowing options to release or rupture. Cost is implied but not viscerally paid; tension remains atmospheric rather than corporeal.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—learning the buildings’ language—is signaled early and tightens through weekly sessions; rooftop interrogation forces Clara to articulate the cost of inheritance, narrowing her future path. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—access quarantined memories—tightens once: shell’s warmth triggers the flow. Cost is emotional (tear, burden of archive) but not materially irreversible; escalation is single, coherent, and sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—undoing the water-supply betrayal—is signaled early and tightened when the key reveals the original decree. Escalation is one-directional but sufficient: each beat narrows Elias’s options until the final act of confession forecloses his anonymity. Cost is legible in the blood signature and the dissolution of the key, marking irreversible exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—maintaining echo/silence balance—is signaled early and escalates through the child-spirit’s growing echo. One meaningful tightening occurs when the singer pivots from study to soothing. Cost is legible but soft: the seashell falls silent, melancholy lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring purity from tragedy—escalates as dream fragments tighten the noose around the survivors’ lie. The cost is conceptual: Elara risks shattering living descendants’ peace, but the price is stated more than dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“to appreciate hidden effort”—is signaled early and deepens through sensory accretion, but no live option is foreclosed; the tightening is purely perceptual. Meets the 600-word threshold for meaningful intensification yet lacks a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protect the stillpoint—tightens once when Maya decides to conceal its location. The price (perpetual secrecy, risk of liquidation) is legible, though the escalation is compressed into a single paragraph rather than dramatized across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—will Elias’s solitary translation matter?—tightens as a surface prophet appropriates his findings. Pressure escalates via intensifying storms and growing crowds glimpsed in the glass. Agency, however, remains observational; the decisive shift is external, so cost is more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—bridging generations—tightens when the poet risks his private sound-hoard in public; the communal humming is the earned intensification. Cost is felt in his self-erasure at the end, though the escalation is more tonal than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single stake—protect orb—introduced early; tension escalates because each beat narrows options: key vibrates → race → door → ritual. No reversals, but one decisive tightening: ritual’s success bans intruders with audible harm, exacting personal cost (next guardian bond).

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—restore communal patience via celestial tracking—is signaled early. Pressure grows through accumulating moon-path data and the viaduct’s hum, but the mapper’s agency remains observational; no on-page trade-off or visible price is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—uncover truth vs. protect career—tightens when the note implicates city officials. One meaningful reversal: lantern shifts from artifact to smoking gun. Cost is legible: “might jeopardize her career.”

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to spend savings on repair or on restitution—tightens once when the priest realizes the heart’s silence is the answer. Agency is renunciation; cost is the unhealed heart he must keep carrying. No external coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—ringing the unheard bell—is signaled early and tightened through each shard. The glider’s agency drives every escalation: arrow → kaleidoscope → chamber → bell. Cost is visible in the acid sea’s momentary stillness and the glider’s recalibrated yearning. One more on-page obstacle would push it past 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—uncover truth behind vanished researchers—is signaled early and tightens through each forbidden breadcrumb. The breach moment narrows options irrevocably; cost (career/freedom) is stated but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“save their settlement from the coming storm”—is declared early and escalated by the tidal groan of shifting ice, a fine external cue tightening stakes under the Accumulative lens. Elena’s agency centers the reconstitution; the elders’ skepticism is off-page, lowering palpable conflict. Escalation is one intensifying cadence toward the weighted breath; cost is more thematic (proof of empathy) than visceral. Lucky factor: the vintage shop mirrors offer fragments without physical retrieval friction, softening earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s wish to “learn the sound of endings”—tightens once when she recognizes the quiet melt as a beginning. Agency is renunciation, not external victory; cost is the forfeiture of her original plan. Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in loneliness—escalates through patterned parallels between vines and failed love. Pressure deepens but never narrows options; the cost is atmospheric rather than tactical. Agency is contemplative, fitting the lens, yet lacks a visible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve wisdom’s echo—is clear early; pressure escalates via ritual intensity and parapet resonance, narrowing to the moment of consecration. Cost is legible (“isolation in the present”), but the prophet’s off-stage presence weakens direct antagonistic force.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—collective healing—is signaled early and tightened through the photograph ritual. Agency is diffuse; the group’s shared act narrows options toward communal closure. Cost is felt collectively rather than individually.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decoding linguistic growth—intensifies as the scholar confronts extinction; the crystal’s pure tone crystallizes the cost of his new stance. One clear tightening suffices, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    One clear dominant stake: locate-and-keep a sound memory before it’s erased. Pressure intensifies steadily as options narrow to the chalk-drawing climax; the caretaker arrival adds external pressure that validates the quest rather than resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—harness the ephemeral—is signaled early and tightens through one decisive deepening: from “fix the shaking” to “tune perception.” Agency is Elara’s; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. The cost—loss of bounded human sight—is legible in the final camera image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—flawless goodbye—tightens as death nears, but agency is observational; therapist’s only decisive act is to keep playing. Cost is emotional, not tactical. Pressure escalates via breathing-as-metronome, a subtle but legible intensification under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled early and escalates through each loop closure; the final bridge forces a trade-off between knowledge and safety. Cost is legible in the isle’s tremor and Elara’s dawning awareness of an unending journey, though the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Arthur’s authentic self—tightens when the tooth’s vibration proves the substitute body false. One decisive intensification: the figure’s emergence forces Eleanor to risk her rational identity. Cost is visible in her whispered surrender of skepticism and the garden’s reality-bending response.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—share stars without fire—escalates through each night’s polish: risk is real loss of earthly safety vs soul-deep dream. The final display narrows every option to a single charged grotto moment with visible communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling public shame with personal integrity—tightens via the spiral walk and pendant offering. One clear deepening: viral confession’s grip loosens only after the physical act of surrender. Cost is emotional release rather than forfeiture of something tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“to maintain artistic vision against market pressure”—is named but never tested in scene; no external or internal obstacle escalates. Tension is atmospheric, not causal. No visible cost is extracted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore fading sacred practice—is signaled early and escalates via Elara’s race against the harvest moon. The tightening is communal memory regained, with visible cost in her exhaustion and the vine’s spent luminescence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“to translate heartbeats into maps that could guide humanity”—is signaled early. Pressure tightens through the risk of “one misstep” dissipating starlight forever. The cost is conceptual (lost hope), but the on-page price is abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve communal memory—tightens through daily mapping of shifting light; each measurement forecloses leisure and deepens the solitary cost. One clear intensification: the cavern warms under her attention, signaling the irreversible fusion of keeper and archive.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—collecting weights—tightens as each burden’s heft alters tactics; the weaver’s own burden raises the price. One clear deepening: the ancient civilization’s weight forces a conceptual reprice of the calling itself.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to hold grief productively—is signaled early and tightened once: tentative first cut → confident shaping → serene lion. The deepening is textural rather than causal, but under Accumulative lens the density of loss-made-present reweights the stake with visible cost (curls of wood = memories released). No external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—redeeming wasted life—tightens once when Cyrus steps onto the bridge, foreclosing retreat. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens: each overheard fragment adds weight until the bridge forms. The cost (loss of the camera wheel) is visible, but escalation is more accretive than sharply intensifying.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can one intern resurrect hope in a dead place—tightens when the lights flicker alive, foreclosing the option of total abandonment. Escalation is single but meaningful: from darkness to partial illumination, with the cost of partial failure implicit. Agency drives every beat; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reconciliation with the abandoned temporal-clock dream—tightens once: the humming crystals force Elias to admit the dream’s loss and its possible recovery. The bear’s arrival complicates but does not resolve; the cost is the ache of thirty empty years now consciously shouldered.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—salvaging truth from lies—is signaled early and tightens once when the journal’s code is deciphered. The deepening is driven by her agency, but the price (loss of prior certainty) is stated more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—preservation of ancient methods—is signaled early and tightened through the decoding of knots. Escalation is subtle: silence and waiting intensify until the fisherman relinquishes the rope. Cost is present but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the traveler face his own absence—tightens once via the decision to write his own obituary. Pressure grows accumulatively through scent, memory, and starlight rather than causal reversals. Cost is felt in the phrase "mapping territories of his heart he had avoided."

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—save grafted roses amid fire—narrows via wind shift and on-page costs. One escalation moment: wind-fed ember landing forces choice. Agency preserved without luck.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is signaled early and escalates once when the pedestal proves empty. The tightening is driven by Elara’s sidereal-patience choice rather than external antagonism; cost is the city’s defiant hush turning to gratitude, felt but lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—whether this civilization will accept non-consuming light—is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page opposition or resource loss sharpens it. Escalation is textural: sonar pings intensify, gear accelerates, petals deepen in hue. Agency is diffuse; the sentimentalist acts as cosmic functionary rather than pressured individual. Closure reweights the pattern yet lacks a tangible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—shape collective grief—tightens once when Elias commits to the communal monument. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens: each poem-knot and butterfly cluster increases density until the final reconfiguration. Cost (ribbon spent, mentor departed) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoration of communal balance—tightens when Alaric realizes he cannot act alone. One meaningful escalation: solitary repair attempt → public call for help. Cost is visible in social exposure and relinquished control. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency remains with protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the buried intention—escalates as each thread decoded narrows the mystery toward the sacrificial truth; pressure is intellectual and emotional rather than external, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—village survival via timely map—is signaled early and tightens once when cracks appear exactly where predicted. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal; cost is implied (time running out) but not yet viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—keeping stories alive under censorship—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when she embeds forbidden tales in lyrics, but the beat is summary, not dramatized. Agency is high-level (“she began her broadcast”) without moment-to-moment risk. Cost is abstract; no visible forfeiture on page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—the hope that art could confer safety—is steadily tightened by every shard and ash drift until it collapses when the chair stops. The tightening is earned by earlier images: disintegrating portraits and porcelain cracks foreshadow the conclusion that meaning resists containment. Cost is tangible in the renunciation of that hope.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—memory vs. mandated forgetting—is signaled early and tightens once when the cog forces Milo’s stance crystallization. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting upper-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving vanishing arts through harmony—is declared early but never tested in a single on-page beat. Pressure is diffuse; “unlearning hatred” is reported, not dramatized. No tightening choice or visible price alters Eleanor’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming memory from industrial erasure—is signaled early and escalates through the seed’s vibration under cosmic light. One clear tightening: the act of planting forecloses anonymity and commits Elias to public consequence, with the cost of exposure legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring wonder without losing truth—tightens when Elara must choose disclosure over protocol. Cost is felt in her irrevocable candor. Pressure escalates cleanly under causal lens; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—why some houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightens through each ritual placement. The final tableau narrows options to acceptance, but the price (loss of mystery?) remains conceptual rather than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—diver’s need to integrate the city’s truth—tightens through each spectral vision; the final stance forecloses naive certainty. Pressure is coherent and intensifies via the ampoule’s expanding memories. Cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—escape the endless ascent—is signaled early and tightened by each failed proof. The rupture is the single meaningful escalation that forecloses perpetual confinement and reopens finite possibility. Cost is felt: loss of the staircase’s certainty and the weight of eternity endured.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—proving kindness transcends time—is signaled early and held. Pressure tightens once: the waxing moon peaks, forcing her to finish before dawn. Cost is visible (exhaustion, trembling fingers) but not irreversible; she could simply paint again tomorrow, so the trade-off feels moderate rather than foreclosing.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—rescue dying arts—tightens when the lens reveals life inside the dough, forcing a decisive intensification. Pressure is coherent; the thaw’s delay supplies external urgency; agency remains with Khira and guide, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—“step beyond fate’s design”—tightens each time the tide exhales; Esme’s every micro-choice forecloses alternatives (twisting the yoyo against nature), culminating in a concrete reversal of reality. Pressure scales to length and lands on a live cost rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming the curse into a gift—escalates via each paradox read; the final tightening occurs when the mirror reveals fear’s misunderstanding of death. Agency is interior (reading, touching, accepting) and the cost is the dissolution of the funhouse and prior identity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—protect the drifting community—signaled early. Pressure escalates via cloud fractals and musical response, but the cost is collective, not personal; prophet never risks loss of mallet, limb, or authority. Agency is interpretive rather than interventionist, softening the tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover the expedition’s fate—tightens when the chamber reveals the city itself is the threat. One decisive turn: Kael’s goal flips from exit to containment. Cost is conceptual (eternal vigilance) rather than visceral, limiting upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“rescue truth from lies”—is signaled early and escalates as Eleanor’s parallels tighten; the ledger discovery forces an irreversible exposure, paying a visible social cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering and preserving lost memories—intensifies when the metal box resists extraction, but escalation plateaus after retrieval; no further narrowing of options or new cost beyond “heavier inkwell.”

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    A single coherent stake is maintained: legitimacy of ancestral origins through textual proof. Escalation unfolds as an accumulative deepening—each fragment raises the cost of clinging to prior self-definition and forecloses retreat to the old paradigm. The cost lands: Elias must abandon the dispassionate indexer persona he values. No external antagonist is required; the pressure of revelation is handled cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transform final grief into lantern and release it—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: last gem, last dream, last crane. Agency is renunciation/release with visible cost (tears, weight lifted yet heart heavier). No external antagonist; internal conflict escalates under Accumulative lens. One credible loss: the dream itself, now externalized and gone.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Central stake: harvesting lost potential to redeem future. Stakes escalate from detection to retrieval, pressure tightened by cooling breakers and risk of shields. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; decision to descend is causal, not chance. Cost is present as continued exposure to a haunted wasteland but remains more conceptual than viscerally felt, capping band just below high.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake tightens from find formula → establish resonance → pay emotional/temporal cost; the pull action redefines option space and extracts galactic frequency, with her stance crystallised in a charged poise holding accepted absence.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. profitable deception—tightens when the unrecognized carving forces a single decisive re-evaluation. Pressure escalates under causal lens; the cost is the irrevocable loss of his fabricated identity. One clear turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—freeing prisoners and resentments alike—is signaled early and tightened once when the drawer pull is offered instead of documents. The single deepening choice (shared apology/forgiveness) narrows options and exacts emotional cost. No reversals, but coherent pressure suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens via the withdrawn job offer beat. Causality is textured, not plotted: every image accretes pressure until the dolphins catalyze release and utility-pole navigation becomes a lived narrowing. Felt cost is the abandonment of cosmic charts for terrestrial markers.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—will empathy survive the loop?—is signaled early and tightened when the protagonist must sign the ball knowing it will erase another self; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—is signaled early and tightened by each ritual step; the cost is the partial loss of humanity. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to inhale, to root, to exhale glyphs. Coincidence (phoenix timing) complicates but does not resolve. One clear tightening: the specter warns she must “walk through” alone.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens once via the saucer’s vision, but escalation is more textural than causal; pressure accrues through imagery rather than narrowing options. Cost is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—open the locked dimension or remain the last lonely human—tightens through each stitch; one wrong move could collapse the bridge. Agency is continuous: Eli’s renunciation of violence and embrace of compassion drive every escalation, with the visible price of irreversible bodily departure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—transmit coordinates undetected—is signaled early and tightened by the blackout clock. One meaningful deepening: blackout enables the sundial stroke. Cost is present but abstract (risk of exposure); pressure coheres under situational lens without external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—fulfill the promise to understand sacred patterns—tightens through each stone placement; the Fibonacci-golden-ratio escalation reweights the cost. Agency is ritual action; the final stance crystallizes when she renounces control. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: reclaiming voice under censorship. Pressure tightens through the countdown timer and the storm’s electric window; the poet’s agency crystallizes in the act of writing. Cost is implied—she must descend back into silence—but not viscerally dramatized. One meaningful deepening: the map of scars shifts from artifact to catalyst.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“decode before the symposium begins”—tightens with each tick of unseen clock; the final coordinates foreclose lingering in safe academia. Cost is opportunity loss, legible but lightly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—protecting knowledge from erasure—is signaled early and escalates through nightly rebuilding. Pressure tightens when the poet acknowledges “They’ll burn our stories,” yet the escalation is more atmospheric than tactical; no single beat narrows options decisively. Cost is conceptual (endless labor, identity loss) rather than concrete. Agency is present but diffuse across montage-like beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reverse or escape time’s loss of his daughter—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: compasses fail → shutdown imminent → clock anomaly offers risky path. Agency is clear: he researches, descends, modifies the projector. Cost is felt—he may never return to the living world. Coincidence (clock restarting) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The monsoon clock tightens choices after the knowledge seed glow intensifies; the act of singing under collapsing time forces the decisive turn that reweights collective memory; on-page cost is the permanent, overwhelming influx of ancestral voices.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightened once when the needle locks on his heart. The cost is felt but diffuse; escalation is more cadence shift than irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes in "stripping needless drama" remain internalized and abstract; pressure accumulates texturally but lacks a visible price paid—Elena’s colleagues’ confusion is noted but never tests her resolve with concrete consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate via Lena's agency decoding patterns, narrowing options to confrontation; cost legible in "fate of others" line, but dominant stake (art-mineral conspiracy) signaled late (paragraph 5).

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes signaled early ("rectify the great wrong of silence"), escalation via density increase (mapping plant responses) under Accumulative lens, but agency remains observational—no trade-off or tactical shift narrows options as required for 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through ocean descent pressure and ghost warnings, but the submarine acquisition (owed favor) feels coincidental rather than earned agency; cost is legible in Elias’s transformed identity yet lacks visible trade-offs during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation hinges on Mira’s report of tightened restrictions, narrowing options to collective expansion with undeniable cost ("sanctions have hit them hardest"). Elias’s agency drives the tightening, though the emotional toll of scarcity could deepen the felt stakes beyond logistical strain.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    One tightening via breath agency: inhales draw "forgotten moments," exhales release burdens. Stakes stay abstract until the tear dissolves—visible cost lands late but earns high band. Dominant stake ("where unused love is stored") transforms into "how to release it" with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen via Elara's agency (navigating temporal folds), but the threat remains passive—time dissolving her connection lacks active opposition. Cost is legible conceptually yet feels detached from bodily consequence in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (save seeds before demolition) tightens when crew arrives early, forcing trade-off: flee with partial seeds or risk capture. Cost is visible—she abandons most seeds, sacrificing completeness for survival. Pressure escalates via Elara’s agency (decoding, escape), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (understanding destiny) tightens via moonbeam integration, but pressure lacks visible cost during escalation. Workshop payoff shows conceptual cost, yet stationmaster scene misses tactical trade-offs—no risk beyond "three breathless seconds."

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure tightens through ice melting's cadence shift (metronome to surrender), narrowing options to transformation; cost is visible in abandoned grief layers, though "thawing heart" concept slightly over-explains stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten through decryption pressure with visible cost (surrendering control), yet "vulnerability is power" mantra feels stated rather than earned through specific action until the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: star's disappearance changes knowledge (darkness inevitable), forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visceral in "booklet trembled" as she accepts guidance over prevention. Pressure tightens through sensory density without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (conduct symphony before exhaustion) lacks meaningful tightening; escalation passive as exhaustion "creeps" without protagonist agency testing commitment. No visible price paid until collapse fails band guardrail for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (authenticity of counterfeit emotions) tightens through subsuming client's state; Elias's agency drives one deepening ("paradox of his profession"). Cost is felt in locked cabinet and "affectionate detachment," though escalation could be more visceral under accumulative lens.

    Stakes escalate through protagonist-driven choices: Elara's proposal forms the search party, and the tag discovery forces redefinition of belonging.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (identity as predictor vs creator) tightens through Elara's agency studying pearl, with visible cost crystallized in "gone from seer to participant"; escalation perfectly mirrors Accumulative lens via shadow density.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when the pawn materializes—not as victory but as painful proof of necessary ruthlessness ("couldn't save everyone's memories"). Escalation is pure Accumulative: each step's resonance builds until the single pawn crystallizes the cost of selective remembrance, with Elara's agency driving the deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.8)
    No escalation of pressure: "hidden thunder" is mentioned but never dramatized as a threat, and the stone/feather solve her search instantly. Stakes remain abstract—no trade-offs or narrowing options. Resolution relies on coincidence (finding objects), not protagonist agency; no visible price paid for understanding home.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through thunder's countdown ("two minutes remained"), narrowing options under Accumulative pressure. Cost legible in "fierce repose" and "lines of penance" as tangible manifestations of earned self-forgiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (sacrifice for plural truths) are signaled early but lack protagonist-driven escalation; Ritual Overseers shadow but never test Elara. Pressure accumulates atmospherically (echoes growing louder) without narrowing her options or deepening cost through her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Marcel's agency—tracing pockmarks transforms "fractured consciousness" into reverence, with felt cost in accepting brokenness rather than seeking perfection as options narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (proving whispers > shouts) tightens through Elias's ritual, with the cost crystallizing in his tears and the sister's sudden belonging. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory deepening. Coincidence (sister's reaction) complicates but doesn't resolve—the earned connection stems from Elias's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen via moon-phase constraint: censer’s waxing strength narrows navigation window. Agency in rearranging equipment shows cost of past failures, but reverse migration’s spiritual stakes remain under-tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara speaks her own name, shifting from occlusion to self-acceptance. Cost is unmistakable: tears and exhaustion foreclose the "blocking" path while opening healing, driven purely by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (decoding the gesture) deepens through Elias's agency: investigating gaps in memories/cafe records narrows options to the war narrative. Cost manifests in his altered behavior ("silent pauses"), though escalation leans slightly passive as memories accumulate without tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens: ants’ path deepens into sustenance guidance, then the rising creek forces crystallization. Cost is unmistakable—Elias’s "solitude shifted into solitude by choice," altering his relationship with the map shop forever.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen coherently from preserving light to capturing transformation under accumulative lens, but secret's unspecified nature weakens pressure escalation; cost ("revalue everything") legible yet lacks concrete secondary consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Elara's vulnerability in sharing her story, narrowing her emotional options from isolation to connection. Escalation lacks a tangible trade-off—Lena's arrival resolves tension too neatly without Elara sacrificing or risking something concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via atmospheric pressure (storm vibrations → platform tilt), but escalation lacks protagonist agency. Panic trigger feels externally imposed rather than earned from her actions. Single deepening (grandmother ritual) suffices for length but costs 0.3 for passive escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Beatrice's layered forgiveness ("not because it heals everything"), with orchard tremors creating live-clock pressure. Cost legible in Eloise's tears and the music fragment's incompleteness under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (cosmic unification within hiccup) tighten via time pressure ("hiccup would not last"), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; witness reacts to cosmic forces rather than making trade-offs. Cost ("only opportunity") feels conceptual, not viscerally felt on the page until final unification.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when water reverses, but "through counting backwards" lacks causal mechanics—agency feels passive as time's nature reveals itself rather than Arlo actively wrestling with the method under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via laser experiments narrows options to connection under Accumulative pressure; cost in her consciousness transformation ("quiet wildfire spread") is visceral and directly tied to protagonist agency in barrier creation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten via subway discoveries escalating pressure, but cost remains abstract; "clover melancholy" implies loss yet lacks visible price on tactics—Elena's journey shifts perspective without altering her methods.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative lens: Meredith's call forces Elias to confront his cultivated estrangement, narrowing his options to either maintain isolation or embrace connection. Agency in his choice to listen ("the beginning starts when we're ready") carries visible cost—his transformation from haunted to harmonious. One tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through archivist's ritual (mixing ink, final drawing), but external pressure (archive closure) lacks active resistance. Cost is felt yet not tested by meaningful tactical trade-offs under time pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as rumor success reveals deeper cost—connection achieved but reciprocity trap remains. Agency clear in catalysis attempt; only flaw: "cure" realization borders on convenient without sufficient prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation through textural density—musical notes intensifying to silence—reweights Elion's emotional stakes. Cost is legible in tears and abandoned mapmaker identity, though forest pressure occasionally leans symbolic rather than constraining tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (correcting professional error) tightens via pen's "suggestion"; cost legible in "tending the garden" endurance; agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens through chronopaper writing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (being heard vs. forgotten) tighten through Elias' mapping of gathered silences. Cost crystallizes in "he would remain wordless in their memories." Agency-driven escalation via sign language choices, but secondary stake (preserving mother's legacy) lacks mid-scene friction.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: each artistic clue deepens understanding until final tapestry reweights destruction/preservation; cost legible in Maya's years of underground labor foreclosing her past life.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Elena’s drumming agency under Accumulative lens, but the 4-minute outage relies slightly on coincidence; cost ("fragile hope") is felt yet lacks concrete forfeiture beyond temporal limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes remain professional rather than visceral—Vance's suspicion implies future conflict but lacks immediate cost (e.g., demotion threat). Escalation via storm intensity works, but Marlo's flawless success undercuts tension. Needs one concrete loss (e.g., dropped map during whisper).

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (unspoken secret’s weight) tightens through visitor’s physical reactions, but conceptual cost lacks visceral legibility; escalation relies on atmospheric pressure over concrete tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is driven purely by Arthur’s agency under the Accumulative lens: his grotto visits deepen the stakes from personal concern to generational impact, narrowing options to silent provocation. Cost is unmistakable in "cracks in the concrete of routine" and the "forests... resonating for generations," making compliance’s price felt. Dominant stake (rigid education vs. creative freedom) tightens meaningfully through the window displays’ planning, though secondary pressure from town philosophy remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (freedom vs conformity) tightens through scrimshaw's evolving text, yet whale's intervention feels coincidental rather than earned escalation; Mara's dive lacks prior tactical shifts showing her agency narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: whittling evolves from simple shaving to creating expressive figures representing criminalized emotions, narrowing options to the "morally ambiguous space between." Cost is felt through brittle petals and social judgment ("fraud" vs. "saint" labels), though secondary stake (community grief) lacks sufficient deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (artistic freedom vs. restriction) are clear early, but pressure never tightens meaningfully—the ban is already lifted, and transformation occurs frictionlessly through paraphrasing. Agency lacks trade-offs; the poet pays no visible price (e.g., physical cost or moral dilemma), making the conceptual cost feel abstract rather than dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through density accumulation as the courtyard inhales, tightening options toward the reed tongue trade; cost is legible in Gideon’s trembling hands and Elara’s sudden color return, though the awakening’s mechanics slightly obscure causal pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen through the lens activation (one meaningful intensification), but the conceptual cost ("work far from finished") remains abstract; pressure lacks visceral escalation as the pilgrimage continues unchanged despite revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes deepen through "withering to bloom" motif, but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening; pressure accumulates texturally yet misses meaningful on-page reversal where Elena confronts her grief actively rather than maintaining ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten credibly when the visitor reveals the project "could prevent future crashes," escalating pressure through dialogue-driven agency; cost of inherited responsibility feels earned yet slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes (accessing memories) tighten via density increase as particles coalesce, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the "steadily unpredictable" atoms drive change, not Elara's choices. Cost ("forever changed") feels abstract; no visible price alters tactics beyond emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s accumulation of shadow sketches, culminating in the unbound shadow’s approach; cost is unmistakable in "understanding too late," reweighting her mission with conceptual price paid in luminous regret.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's internal pressure alone—"three days since the con" creates urgency—but escalation lacks external constraint; her whispered realization drives the deepening under Accumulative lens with felt cost in "wounded spirit" parallel.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist’s pattern-deciphering agency; dominant conflict (excavation vs integration) forecloses wound-opening path with cost shown in her transformed reflection. Escalation via sensory density shift to tunnel discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen via Accumulative pressure as "hushed thunder" intensifies, but Elena's agency remains passive reception rather than active choice; the single tightening (letters fusing with film) lacks tangible cost beyond emotional realization.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative escalation succeeds through sensory density ("nighthawks whispered... stones sang"), but cost remains abstract; no tangible consequence like ruined artwork to ground the creative blockage.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation through deepening: "occasionally everywhere" ability transforms from flaw to strength as guard achieves presence. Cost is palpable in the "unfamiliar flutter" when admitting he dreams now.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: distinguishing tree timbres actively narrows options, with gear's warming creating tangible pressure. Conceptual cost ("accepting probable miracles as natural state") legibly reconfigures existence without physical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure ("courage waits in quiet places") but protagonist agency lacks escalation; cost remains abstract despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative pressure via urgent messages and library collapse narrows options effectively. Protagonist agency weakens escalation—resolution stems from external messages, not her choices—diminishing cost legibility despite strong dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (vanishing paths) deepen via atlas/satellite comparison, but escalation relies on sudden realization after sleepless night rather than protagonist-driven pressure; cost stays abstract without tactical alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (meaning in rebellion’s mess) tightens via stone circle’s hum forcing surrender of opera glasses; cost legible in "she paid them no mind," though rebellion context remains slightly abstract for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake (crisis-time relationship) escalates through the ink experiment’s physical danger, narrowing options to life-or-insight. Vital fluctuations provide visceral cost that alters the tracker’s subsequent command ("Record this") with awe.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (duty vs truth) tighten through Elena's network access, but escalation lacks middle development—pressure jumps from discovery to upload without intermediate tactical constraints; "contraband truths" dominate but remain abstract until transmission.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (weaving continuity through chaos) is signaled early but escalation remains internal; wrapping the cutting with airship scrap deepens commitment without narrowing options or altering tactics, missing the visible price required for high-band escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (catching echo) signaled early, but pressure never escalates: constellations' disturbance remains observational, no narrowing of options, and the conceptual cost lacks felt urgency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes signaled early (clearing Davies), pressure tightens through evidence deepening. But "proof by contradiction" method isn't dramatized as active tool—assumed then abandoned until climax. Cost felt conceptually but lacks tangible tradeoff (e.g., time, emotional toll).

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through firmware’s behavior (baby cries → lullaby), but Elias acts reactively; pressure tightens via time-folding’s "origami" compression, yet protagonist agency lacks decisive escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes (healing pill victims) tighten via neural network light patterns, but escalation leans on passive geode behavior ("began to vibrate") rather than Maya's agency. Static shock as catalyst risks coincidence-under-accumulative-lens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.5)
    Stakes ("voice of unknown") remain abstract with zero escalation—Maya faces no resistance (ropes hold, no physical threat). Dominant stake isn't tested; fossil "chooses her" without trade-offs. Agency is passive reception, not decision/renunciation with visible cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten via density increase: button arrangements narrow prophecy from "impossible" to actionable truth. Cost is felt in solitude-to-community shift, though conceptual price lacks visceral weight. Single deepening suffices for length but could heighten emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stake tightening via gutter ticks is masterful, but "palimpsest promise" abstraction slightly blurs cost legibility; pricked thumb’s blood feels earned yet understated.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (reconnecting creativity with soul) deepen through sensory accumulation, but pressure lacks a meaningful tightening choice; the epiphany feels passive rather than driven by Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder amid identity flux) tightens when librarian stops "fighting changes" and actively smelts stories.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: coffee prophecy forces immediate action, narrowing options to propagation with visible cost (violin's inert state); Empire threat remains slightly abstract but gains visceral weight through the iron eagle crest prophecy.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten via crow patterns shifting direction, narrowing options to canyon's heart. Cost (physical dissolution) unmistakable in "Kael was gone," but escalation leans more on environmental cues than protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (survival vs. witnessing death) clear early, but escalation lacks causal pressure—Korin's doubt is sole complication; "accelerating contraction" stated not shown, failing band guardrail for visible price charging final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) declared but never tested—zero opposition or trade-offs. "Storm-born silence" sets mood but no live clock tightens decisions; escalation is passive reflection, not agency-driven deepening under textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (dimensional exile vs belonging) escalate through pendant's warming and light-bending; agency shown via active waiting and energy-drawing. Cost (identity dissolution into "belonging everywhere") legible but moral calculus lacks competing goods depth.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (freeing idea) is clear but never viscerally tested. Pressure dissolves when Silas' ritual succeeds perfectly—no trade-offs, tactical shifts, or narrowing options. The "fear" remains abstract; no felt cost emerges until the ribbon's dissolution, arriving too late to drive escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reclaim identity) signaled immediately; pressure grows through pattern recognition under Accumulative lens. Cost visible in "skeletal frames settling deeper," though escalation lacks meaningful tightening beyond deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—her overlays transform observation into celestial alignment discovery, narrowing options to accepting experiential knowledge. Cost is felt in her "profound sense of shielded openness," foreclosing documentation for reverence under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes deepen through Elara’s agency: her methodical note-taking narrows options to the snow globe’s true meaning, with the cost being emotional vulnerability (tears) and paradigm shift. Single meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (articulating unspoken needs) signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation. Ghost's loneliness remains static; no narrowing of options when encoding fails. "Between lightning and thunder" timeframe tightens decisions but isn't leveraged for cost (e.g., missed flashes causing communication loss). Resolution feels earned yet abstract—no visible price paid beyond emotional catharsis.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through her accumulating reflections, but the "scattered light" breakthrough lacks visible cost—her emotional shift feels earned yet the conceptual price isn't dramatized physically, missing 8.8+ band requirements for tangible cost linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (prove atmospheric memory) clear, but physical danger of broken string never tests commitment; pressure stays conceptual without narrowing options. "Quietly explosive" motivation lacks visible trade-offs—no tactic alteration when clouds shift toward mentor’s pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (capturing essence vs appearance) tightens meaningfully when coin redefines "soul patterns," but escalation lacks visceral pressure—conceptual shift dominates over tangible cost until final image. Agency-driven deepening satisfies band guardrails, though felt cost arrives late.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (restoration as belonging) deepens through Elias's agency, with legible cost in identity transformation. However, conflict lacks tangible opposition—the library's challenges feel passive, missing one live option foreclosed before the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: foam observation crystallizes trade-off between isolation and connection. Cost is legible in emotional shift ("grief loosened its grip") and vulnerable call, scaling perfectly to length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (finding story origins) lacks escalation—pressure diffuses rather than intensifies during the lull. Agency in door-creation is earned, but cost remains retrospective (parole terms) rather than dramatized in-scene consequence, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake (transforming remorse) tightens through Kael's descent with visible emotional cost. Agency manifests via sandpapering method under Accumulative pressure; the "trembling hands" tradeoff perfectly scales cost for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (community division) signaled early, with meaningful deepening via language-interspersing meetings.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (becoming dream archaeologist) deepen via entangled memories' influx, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—activation succeeds immediately with no setbacks. Cost (identity dissolution) is legible at dawn, yet tightening feels passive under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (source of resilience) tightens via inversion’s physical escalation: rivers invert → trees lift → arrow glows → echoes reveal truth. Agency drives pressure (Arion navigates water flow to reach First Arch), but resolution lacks tangible trade-off; no credible loss alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (quantifying emotion) tighten through Thomas’s disorientation, narrowing Elara’s path to unethical methods. Cost is legible in her isolation and "calculated disruption," but internal conflict lacks deeper testing beyond her stated resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (validating her theory) tightens meaningfully as prism reveals memories, forcing Elara's renunciation of prior assumptions with visible cost ("quest had been too small").

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)

    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (fluorescing gems' "dancing shadows") not external pressure. One tightening suffices at this length: lantern completion forces the basilica journey. Cost legible in "tears of relief and sorrow," though escalation lacks visceral mid-beat tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (harvest potential before systems reboot) tightens relentlessly via causal chain: cooling breakers → descent → pool convergence. Final cost is conceptual—Elias embracing his transformed identity with "bleak exhilaration"—made undeniable by the foreignness of his smile as systems hum back to life.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven purely by Maya’s agency—star trail sequencing tightens options toward convergence point—with felt cost crystallized in her racing heart and existential certainty; "missing connection" deepens stakes organically, but pilgrim’s abstract warnings lack concrete on-page threat escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by Martin's agency: searching "not to deceive but to find real" tightens stakes. Cost is unmistakable in "tears washing away layers of deception" and business closure decision. Pressure coheres through Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (emotional reconciliation) tightens meaningfully through the apology/forgiveness timeframe. Visible cost in Rennett's physical release earns the climax, though one escalation beat suffices for this length; Lyra's ritual setup drives agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Self-forgiveness vs perpetual regret stake tightens meaningfully via rejection letter, driving Elena's agency in reinterpretation. Escalation manifests through textural density (compass weight intensifying then lightening) with unmistakable cost legible in the physical sensation shift during paddling.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (rekindling empathy) tightens through the labyrinth choice, with the time-loop revealing the cost of eternal repetition. Agency-driven escalation falters slightly when the newspaper's mechanics feel asserted rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Eliora's agency—spice mixing and glyph-breathing deepen the bond-reforging goal under Accumulative lens; cost is felt in the fading connection, though the phoenix timeframe's urgency lacks tangible pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through ritual revelation (time compressed not destroyed), but escalation lacks a decisive cadence shift; "choking beauty" recurrence flattens pressure escalation in the accumulative lens's critical deepening phase.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake ("one wrong stitch could collapse bridge") signaled early but escalation lacks visceral cost. No tactical trade-off during stitching; "hands steady" undermines tension. Ship dissolution as cost feels earned but not unmistakable on-page during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding transformation) signaled early, but pressure never escalates meaningfully. Protagonist passive—cosmic forces dictate detour, not choice. Cost of releasing bugs is abstract ("richer understanding"), not visceral or legible on page. Stakes remain philosophical, never tested concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Revolutionary stakes tighten meaningfully under Accumulative lens: blackout compresses options, forcing encoded communication. Cost is legible in Elias' "warm weight" awareness, though moral calculus lacks deeper complexity beyond "ideas over weapons" dichotomy.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preventing cosmic unraveling) tightens via sequence complexity; cost (enduring curse with transformed meaning) legible in closure. Agency-driven escalation through stone placements, but secondary stake (self-preservation) lacks visible tradeoff during sixth stone placement.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes crystallize through "masks slip" timeframe tightening tactics, with timer beeps driving escalation. Cost is conceptual (truth's fragility) but lacks physical manifestation—thunder rumbles like censors yet never disrupts her actual writing process.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single tightening via needle card rotation narrows options to coordinates; conceptual cost (vulnerability in sharing method) felt but could be more visceral in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (preserving knowledge) deepens through reflection, but pressure lacks tangible escalation; resistance "blooming" remains thematic rather than testing commitment with new complications.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate via compass failures → arbor descent → shutdown deadline; agency-driven deepening as pianist modifies projector. Felt cost crystallizes when clock spins, reconfiguring time's meaning without physical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (preserve culture) clear early but pressure never tightens meaningfully; monsoon deadline creates urgency yet no trade-offs or sacrificed options; cost remains atmospheric rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through tutor's agency as lace pattern shifts from concentration to diffusion, reweighting options; conceptual cost is legible though "diffuse accumulated sorrow" slightly abstracts the tradeoff.
