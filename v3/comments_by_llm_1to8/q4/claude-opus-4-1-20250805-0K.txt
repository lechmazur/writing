  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (Elena's shift from theoretical to observational science) deepens through accumulation of butterfly dust observations, fitting the textural lens. However, the escalation lacks felt pressure—her colleagues' "theatrical mourning" provides no real opposition, and her resignation decision arrives without dramatized struggle or visible trade-offs beyond declared career consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from physical survival after arson to the moral choice of whether to warn others about poisoned materials, culminating in Marina's decision to disappear. The frost's teaching moment provides a meaningful deepening that changes her options. Cost is visible in her willingness to abandon her entire artistic identity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation rather than reversal—each thermal discovery adds to Mira's understanding while the weight of loss (crew, hearing, mentor) provides constant pressure. The dominant stake of "rectifying what silence had stolen" evolves from personal loss to scientific breakthrough, with visible cost in frozen tears and isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Silas's quest for rest—escalates from personal insomnia to civilizational exhaustion, with meaningful deepening when he discovers the library's true nature. The transformation carries cost (leaving his life behind), though the middle section's conflicts feel abstract rather than visceral. The lens's pull provides coherent pressure, but the ease of the months-long transformation undercuts tension.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from individual survival through communal exchange to confronting government officials, with the bell ritual providing coherent pressure throughout. The cost of maintaining anonymity ("need has no face") shapes tactics meaningfully. Slightly weakened by the too-smooth progression where "something had shifted" without showing sufficient intermediate struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative revelation: sparks intensify→ghost appears→tear transforms vision→door manifests→understanding inverts (give not take). Mae's agency drives each deepening through breathing patterns and the choice to use the tear, with clear cost when she sacrifices her life's work of photographs.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural deepening as each interaction with the bridges reveals more layers of temporal imprisonment, from seeing other iterations to feeling time's granular texture to the final dissolution. The cost becomes unmistakable as the halo fragment's disintegration takes "one of her other selves" with each particle, though the middle section could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal liberation to humanity's food future through clear causal steps. The chain-breaking represents both literal and symbolic freedom with visible cost in Marcus's careful, burdened movement afterward. Pressure coheres through the resistance message, code-breaking urgency, and dawn deadline. The trade-off between escape and completing the mission lands with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from seeking betrayal's frequency, to discovering the forge/notebooks, to the imprinting process, to hearing "every note of what had been lost." The cost manifests in Elena's acceptance that cellular division itself is "small betrayal"—she'll carry this knowledge through all her divisions. One meaningful deepening that reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the daughter left—is clear and emotionally charged. The revelation that "she was already leaving" provides meaningful deepening that changes the mother's understanding. Cost is visible in the mother's emotional response, though the conflict lacks multiple pressure points typical of higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—creating safe spaces for dangerous questions in a poisoned place—is signaled early and tightens when the couple arrives, forcing Marina to demonstrate rather than merely craft her philosophy. The cost is legible in the radiation exposure risk and the emotional weight of returning to her father's workplace. However, the escalation relies heavily on accumulation rather than decisive turns, and the couple's immediate trust feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds causally from discovery (cast equations) → revelation (synthetic identity) → confrontation → reversal where Marcus weaponizes his programmed limitations. The cost is legible when Jake experiences the transferred fears he never learned to navigate. "Vulnerability is power" crystallizes as Marcus transforms his engineered weaknesses into weapons, though the reversal mechanism could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (completing her map before the star dies) faces one meaningful deepening when she realizes the star "would not die tonight," forcing acceptance of extended vigil. While this reweights her understanding, the piece lacks intermediate pressure points that would heighten the final recognition's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through Seven's temporal perception revealing seventeen variations of his approach, culminating in the violin's resonance unlocking his understanding. The cost manifests in his acceptance of endless repetition as "small infinities where thoughts could emerge," though the internal nature of the conflict lacks external pressure that would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through layered revelations: Samuel protected Marcus, Mira made corrections to muddy waters, Marcus confessed—each tightening the emotional pressure toward reconciliation. The dominant stake of trust/mistrust coheres throughout with visible cost in their three-month silence. Slightly abstract at times rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: drought memory, inspector confrontation, and final teaching moment create textural deepening. The stakes—proving luck measurements false through "beautiful lies"—remain consistent, though a sharper tightening moment would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal scientific validation to revolutionary physics discovery, with pressure building through Vasquez's interruptions and the station's physical shuddering. The tightening occurs when Ira must choose between safety (stopping) and proof (continuing), though the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through deepening revelation (program dissolving → notation appearing → ghost orchestra manifesting). The water level forcing Marcus deeper creates physical pressure. However, no real opposition or cost until the final movement - the journey feels somewhat frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to witness and protect impossible truth—escalates through discovery of the illustrations, understanding their pattern, and witnessing the aurora flowers. Pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. The cost of necessary deception and identity erasure is clear, though tension could tighten further in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from urban exploration curiosity to moral witness as radio confessions reveal the valve wheel's tragic significance. Marcus's choice between documenting for fame versus preserving the site creates genuine tension. The "weight of swallowed truth" lands with cost. Deduction for pressure building more through revelation than active conflict—appropriate for the lens but limits escalation ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—maintaining witness without judgment—faces pressure through explorers' intrusions and the library's wild transformation. Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening: books decomposing to soil, words growing as mushrooms, finally the keeper herself transforming. The cost (isolation, silence, dissolution of self) is visible, though the piece lacks a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through accumulative pressure: from envelope to memory to ritual to release, with the eclipse creating a temporal constraint ("Five minutes until totality"). The cost is legible when Elena releases the irreplaceable curl she's protected through "moves and divorces," though the conflict could tighten further through more resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure accumulates through discoveries that reweight understanding—from physical fragments to consciousness sliding along the displaced axis—narrowing toward Thrain's acceptance of her role. The dominant stake (preserving stories for the next cycle) gains weight through each revelation, though the middle section's abstract philosophizing briefly dilutes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from observing others' fortunes coming true to Chen writing his own prophecy. The Bulgarian's pale realization effectively tightens pressure, though the final transformation could carry more immediate dramatic weight rather than philosophical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    The seventeen-minute deadline creates genuine pressure while Marcus's deliberate patience ("such things required patience, like teaching stone to remember it was once sand") provides counter-tension. The escalation through layered loops that force the demon to name itself ("I am assumption") demonstrates agency-driven deepening with clear cost in the woman's unraveling possession.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through temporal disorientation, exhaustion's approach, and the weight of "ten thousand fortunes," culminating in Mei's choice to conduct rather than resist. The cost is visible (isolation, job loss, physical exhaustion), though middle escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from physical burden (tablet's impossible mass) through fractured identity to the ultimate choice of which timelines to let die, with the elder Kira crystallizing the cost: "refusing to choose murders you across all of them." The procedural generation's acceleration and the shadows of might-have-beens create coherent pressure, though mid-section exposition about the tablet's properties slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from seeking sound to discovering vibration-based connection, with the worn needle creating increasing "filament of hush between each vibration." The protagonist's agency drives the experiment, though the conflict could benefit from more concrete resistance before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from routine observation to understanding she's been weaponized—her data enables weather manipulation for the coming breach. The pressure tightens when she realizes "they know you're watching" transforms her from observer to participant. Elena's decision to create redundant records shows agency foreclosing the path of passive compliance with visible risk.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief to inherited purpose as each extinct scent triggers deeper revelations about her mother's work. The transformation carries clear cost—Elara loses her individual self to become a living archive—though the physical mechanics of this change remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating moral complexity: wrongful imprisonment → brother's guilt → daughter's silence → judge's lifetime of compensation. Each layer tightens the ethical noose without offering resolution. The cost is legible in Marcus's final understanding that "justice and mercy were often impossible to reconcile," though the personal price Marcus pays could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal silence-breaking to communal rebirth through accumulation of musicians, each addition deepening the texture. The cost is legible in accepting imperfection over restoration—"not the polished performance Echo Harbor had once prized." One meaningful deepening occurs as incomplete music becomes the new form rather than failure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from harvesting emotions to resisting personal consumption ("It would be so easy to absorb them all"). The temporal pressure of dusk's transformation creates urgency. Cost is visible in Vera's choice to remain emotionally incomplete herself while trafficking in others' severed sentiments.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity (nightly library visits) through moral obligation (delivering the locket) to community transformation (securing donated books, enabling teaching). The dominant stake—whether silent contributions matter—tightens when Margot must choose between simple delivery versus deeper engagement. Cost is visible in her transformation from "tallying manifests while others waltzed" to active participation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as the tag search transforms from individual curiosity to community ritual, culminating in the collective descent. The dominant stake—completing the arbor/finding the artist—tightens when the pattern reveals itself on night seven. Cost is visible but the escalation could be sharper; the discovery feels somewhat convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—releasing trapped extinctions—escalates from personal mission to city-wide disruption. Marina's agency drives the resolution through her drawings. Cost is visible in the time-sculptors' lost resources and the city's forced recalibration, though the personal cost to Marina could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on understanding Elias's disappearance, with pressure building through the ritual's steps and revelation. The cost appears in Morrow's acceptance that return is impossible, though the transformation's ease reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Edgar's need for connection versus safety in hiding—faces pressure when the archivist directly acknowledges him. This moment narrows his options but the story ends before he acts on this crystallized choice. Cost is conceptual rather than paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from documenting phenomena to accepting literal transformation with clear cost—loss of human identity. The pressure coheres through accumulating plant changes and Marcus's physical symptoms. However, the middle section could tighten; Marcus's resistance dissolves somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—obtaining pure water to "paint truth instead of merely survival"—escalates through the exchange's emotional cost. The three-hour tide window creates natural pressure. The revelation of the child's death deepens stakes beyond material exchange to shared grief and artistic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: Vera's blindness leads to the shadow-entity's revelation about "quiet enchantments," then to her expanded awareness of the cave's history, culminating in her transformed sight. The cost—losing her certainty about dramatic futures—is legible but could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from personal fragments to community contributions, from mechanical valve turns to "living practice." The dominant stake of reconstructing meaning after exile tightens when Kessa discovers "spaces between words could speak as loudly as words themselves," forcing her emotional rather than chronological arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: seventeen patterns lead to following arrows, then entering mist, finally discovering the fortress. The "dare" to step off documented reality carries clear cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara understands the fortress's nature and commits to repeated navigation despite impossibility.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the three-day migration deadline and Elena's choice between maintaining skepticism or accepting entangled knowledge. The tile's warming and pattern-shifting provides tangible pressure, though the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment where options genuinely narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.4)
    Central stake of escaping immortality's prison escalates through the crew's arrival and amulet reunification, with clear cost in choosing transformation over safety. The spatial mutiny provides external pressure while Vex's internal conflict drives the resolution. Escalation could be stronger—the middle section explains more than dramatizes the rising tension. The final choice carries weight but arrives somewhat smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through Maya's "waiting actively" for Wei, through revelation of the account numbers, to the ink pot containing ashes - each beat tightening the moral calculation. The cost is legible in Wei's trembling hands and Maya's precise stitching of her father's lips, though one more turn could have deepened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from documenting histories to revealing specific erasures (the denied fire, the Chinese princess), culminating in the monk's silent acknowledgment that "the trees knew better." The physical cost appears in aching fingers and the patience required for this solitary work against institutional denial.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation reads as accumulative deepening—from solitary ghost to discovering fellow erased beings to joining their testimony. The spring tide creates natural pressure forcing Mari's decision. Cost is legible when she signs away her singular identity to join the collective witness.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from professional investigation to personal participation as Marina discovers the ephemeral compass tracks emotional rather than physical navigation. The tightening occurs when she must choose between busting the myth or preserving it, with her professional identity as the visible cost. Pressure builds through accumulative discoveries rather than reversals, fitting the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from graffiti warning through developer arrival to community mobilization, with Maya's choice narrowing from negotiation vs. resistance to creative synthesis.

Cost is visible in leaving the hourglass and accepting humanity's retreat, though escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The twenty-minute deadline creates temporal pressure and the Meridian's dependence on the drone establishes clear stakes. However, the repair proceeds too smoothly - Maya never struggles or makes a mistake despite the delicate work. The conflict lacks a meaningful complication or reversal that would force adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsession to Commonwealth inspection threat to shared scientific revolution. The inspector's arrival forces Margot's hand—she must choose between safety and revelation. Cost is legible in "risk everything on the word of a dry-witted atlas editor."

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—saving Millhaven from collapse—is signaled early and deepens through accumulation as more townspeople join the walking patterns.

Cost is visible in the three-year commitment and daily ritual required, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the compound's depletion creating a ticking clock, forcing Maya's choice between escape and surrender. The cost is visible (loss of human life/connections), though the middle section's exploration of the temple could tighten—some passages describe rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal vindication to exposing systemic injustice, with the supply boat deadline creating urgency. The dominant stake (proving truth before discovery) tightens through Marcus's choice to testify rather than escape. Cost is visible in his acceptance of continued imprisonment for truth.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the bead's increasing pulse matching "a heartbeat that hadn't beaten for centuries" to the greenhouse trembling and fruit brightening. The hundred-year cycle creates temporal pressure forcing tonight's resolution. Cost is legible in both the ghost's protective toxicity that "slowly consumed" and Marlow's final tears, though the transformation mechanism feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through textural accumulation as Calla's discovery of the golden spiral pattern three moons ago enables her current work of "sewing threads that wouldn't exist until tomorrow into fabric that had unraveled yesterday."

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving human connection through craft) established early and deepens through accumulation of process details. The three-hour constraint provides mild pressure but doesn't force difficult trade-offs. Cost is primarily conceptual (ephemeral work) rather than dramatically contested, fitting the textural lens but lacking sharp escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (transmitting intelligence before the coup) intensifies through Minister Crane's suspicious visit, forcing Vera to maintain her disguise under direct scrutiny while continuing critical work.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding meaning in survival) deepens through accumulation as more patients join the translation ceremony, transforming individual trauma into collective healing. The child's request creates pressure that forces Maya to confront her survivor's guilt, with cost visible in "that lotus-hearted ache" and the giving away of her salvaged coral. One meaningful deepening sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering/displaying lost joy—intensifies from personal discovery to communal restoration. The knowledge network's activation marks the key escalation, transforming Marina from receiver to transmitter. Cost is visible in the impermanence and the ache of witnessing what was lost, though the resolution could press harder on what Marina sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through layered discoveries—nested artists, the hobo nickel, frozen time, reflected future voices—each tightening Elena's awareness of recursive reality. The cost manifests as she chooses ignorance over understanding, sealing the coin away for future iterations. Minor deduction: Marcus's freezing feels slightly convenient rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation follows the accumulative lens through density increase - from coded seeds to Auditor arrival to orchestrated insect defense. The trade-off is clear: Marcus sacrifices himself to protect the network. One meaningful tightening as the Auditors triangulate and force Marcus's defensive gambit.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on transforming the paradigm from "suffering as weapon" to "pain as nutrient," with escalation through the gradual arrival of other creators and establishment of the permanent armistice. The cost accumulates through centuries of isolation and the wearing away of the galaxy postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing war through translation—is clear early and tightens when Elena discovers the misunderstanding's nature. The pressure escalates from scholarly curiosity to diplomatic urgency with tomorrow's deadline. However, the conflict lacks immediate opposition; Elena faces intellectual challenge but no active resistance or competing pressure that would force harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through Mara's progressive realization: discovering mixed resin → measuring the amphitheater → designing deceptive floodgates → choosing anonymity. The stakes deepen as her plan's "elegant cruelty" reveals the cost of forcing cooperation through deception. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment—the solution arrives too smoothly without testing Mara's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Margot can reinvent herself by destroying her past—faces meaningful escalation when Theodore reveals he knew her identity, forcing her to confront rather than erase.

However, the resolution lacks immediate dramatic tension—Marina's choice to whisper back needs higher cost visibility to reach the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from observing an anomaly to witnessing the city's awakening to understanding one's place within cosmic cycles. The luminous respite creates genuine tension through its rarity (once every 600 years) and Mira's recognition of her role as witness. Cost manifests in accepting limitation—understanding arrives through inhabitation rather than conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes center on understanding loss and memory's impermanence, established early through the recollectionist's work. The pressure deepens through accumulated emotional fossils but lacks a true tightening or forcing event. The discovery of sprouts provides mild escalation but without forcing a choice or extracting visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation occurs through emotional frequency targeting and the teenager encounter that shifts Marcus from performer to genuine connector. The tide's return creates time pressure. Stakes deepen but the final cost - accepting unpredictability - needs more visceral weight to fully land.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—creating art that will outlast tyranny despite inevitable capture—is signaled early and tightens as the ritual progresses from a grain of dust to full-body transformation. The escalation follows the textural lens as the moonstone dust multiplies and spreads, with clear cost in accepting tomorrow's capture. However, the lack of immediate external pressure or complication during the dance itself slightly weakens the escalation's visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The development company's demolition letter creates external pressure that forces Marcus's stance crystallization about preserving knowledge before destruction. However, the conflict remains largely internal without dramatic confrontation, and Marcus faces no immediate trade-offs or visible prices during his contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from private guilt to the necessity of vulnerable teaching, with the box's generational losses deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (ethical storytelling) is signaled but never faces concrete on-page testing - the conflict happened twenty minutes ago and Marcus simply prepares for tomorrow. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; he remains in the same serene state throughout. The piece lacks escalation under any lens, with no visible price paid or options narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from moth wing examination to structure-building to monarch arrival to dissolution. The dominant stake (honoring erased histories through temporary creation) tightens when the monarch reads the moth scales, then departs carrying knowledge it won't survive to deliver. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the moment of creation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation - from personal guilt to generational responsibility, with each discovery tightening pressure. The punched card pattern matching the rope's weave creates a decisive turning point that forces action. Cost is visible in the tears freezing, the night-long labor, and the transformation of guilt into purpose, though the resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating revelations: Kira's certainty about future events, the dream chamber's activation, Chen's encoded answer, and the crushing truth about reversed time. The storm provides external pressure while internal stakes deepen through each discovery. Cost is legible in her bitter laugh and the paradox of "knowing everything and understanding nothing."

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to humanity's first contact with cosmic intelligence, with Mara's years of sacrifice establishing cost. The tightening occurs as each discovery (tile location, mathematical key, second tile) narrows options toward the inevitable covenant-sealing. Cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt—we understand but don't fully experience the weight of her isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: Marcus's waiting, the Magistrate's arrival with soldiers, the dying son's fever, culminating in the cellular memory transfer that forces confrontation with inherited violence. The cost lands viscerally in the Magistrate's tears and his grip loosening, though Vera's role dilutes some agency.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the breathing sequence where synchronized rhythm manifests the lost vision, then immediately begins fading when broken. The astronomer's agency drives the request and participation; Elara's expertise shapes the method. Cost appears in the three months of pursuit and the final acceptance that dreams must be "inhabited" rather than captured.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: dozens of dying quartz eyes represent sight and hope, Mira's challenge forces Elara to confront her vow, and the mending work requires teaching what Elara had sworn to keep isolated. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes "wisdom isn't preserved through isolation but through teaching," foreclosing her path of protective withdrawal with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from mysterious artifact to understanding temporal paradox to accepting one's role in creating/discovering knowledge across time. The bathroom retreat represents genuine agency—choosing vulnerability to achieve clarity. Cost manifests in the "terrible joy" and acceptance of forgetting/remembering cycles, though the resolution could press harder on what specifically is lost.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from exploration to survival as Mira discovers the frozen seekers and must avoid their fate. The circular room trap forces active problem-solving. The negotiation represents genuine agency with visible cost - she commits to completing the diary rather than taking knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from scientific pursuit to existential choice about memory and identity, with Marina's memories actively reorganizing as she engages with Coraline. The final choice between pinning the card (forgetting) or carrying it (permanent uncertainty) crystallizes genuine cost. Some middle passages lack immediate pressure, particularly the exposition about the garden of forgotten names.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through the rope's three configurations, each revealing deeper truths about diplomatic absences. The approaching thirteenth hour creates real pressure forcing Elara's decision. Cost is legible—she must risk being trapped or lost in merged space to complete her work.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preserving balance → reading damage patterns → discovering the bloom → risking extraction under interference → accepting fundamental change.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from tending a dead beacon to discovering the shard, from touching it to see "sideways" visions, to actively reconfiguring star paths. The cost—seventeen years of solitary maintenance—charges every choice. Minor deduction for the resolution relying partly on the shard's coincidental arrival, though this fits the thematic design about meaningful coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal reflection to collective survival through memory, with the fog-stone transformation creating irreversible pressure. The deepening understanding that "consciousness of loss...made them human" meaningfully reweights the dominant stake, though more concrete opposition would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (combating despair through wonder) is signaled early and deepens through the mosaic message discovery. Escalation works through accumulation rather than reversal, building from individual to collective action. The kerosene knot's slow-burn quality mirrors the story's patient resistance, though the conflict lacks a meaningful tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on whether Chen will return to chronicle work, with pressure building through the jade cicada exchange and pool observations. The "wave larger than the rest" provides environmental escalation that "rearranging the topography of their conversation." Cost is legible in Chen's fear of foresight burden, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as accumulative intensification - from anticipation through inversion to harvest, with each vial containing progressively specific silence flavors. The dominant stake (transforming inherited trauma into expansive possibility) deepens through concrete collection. Cost is visible in the contrast between father's ongoing entrapment and Mira's liberation, though the personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—helping the woman find comfort in silence—escalates through Marcus's careful navigation of increasingly challenging acoustic zones. Pressure coheres through the terraces' shifting harmonic frequencies responding to her distress, forcing Marcus to adapt his route. The cost appears in her transformation from fleeing noise to accepting it, though the single-beat resolution lacks deeper complication.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the stairway of ascension before sunrise—drives clear escalation through paint layers revealing progressively deeper truths. The pressure tightens as each layer recontextualizes the quest, though the conflict lacks visceral opposition or genuine risk of failure since discovery proceeds smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through the shadow's encroachment and the keeper's method of "linking through scars," with visible cost in her glowing map of severed connections. The escalation from refusing one shadow to accepting another with "multiple scars like a constellation of grief" shows measured tightening, though the conflict remains primarily internal/metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as abstract promises converge, Marina feels the "familiar sensation" of her past loss, and the turning of the bolt catalyzes transformation. The dominant stake—transforming failure into wisdom—deepens when the pyramid scheme reveals itself as a "filter" for those who can create under pressure. Cost is legible in the lost savings that become the price of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates through the gramophone's revelations—from understanding the gift's mechanism to seeing generational poison to facing her binary choice. The final throw of the crank handle forecloses her path with immediate, dramatized consequence in her lost perception.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulated details: entering greenhouse → reading trees → finding stage → speaking oath → marionettes awakening → taking puppet's hand. The cost lands viscerally with "splinters of potential pierce his skin," though middle beats could sharpen their pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in institutional abandonment—deepens through Marcus's discovery that Timothy returned the button as "a message in a bottle." This reweighting shows how the archives contain not just loss but intentional breadcrumbs. Cost is visible in Marcus's isolation and lost relationship, though the pressure could tighten more dramatically in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear dominant stake established early: recovering proof of erased history before the Ministry strikes. Escalation builds through Jakob's warning of imminent arrests, forcing Mira to act immediately rather than wait for resistance approval. The cost lands concretely—the resistance leaders are sacrificed as distraction while Mira/Jakob work exposed—though the personal price to Mira herself remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy from manifesting through collective unplayed music—escalates from Marcus alone to a gathering of musicians all practicing "musical negative space." The pressure tightens as "hours passed, or perhaps minutes" shows time distortion under the weight of their task. The cost is clear: permanent sacrifice of normal musical expression, though the antagonistic force (the prophecy itself) remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates through pattern recognition—moonstone discovery, leaf messages, monument building—forcing Mira's choice between reporting or embracing her grandmother's path. The stakes (trees choosing to ascend further or return to earth) manifest through her personal transformation, with visible cost in her physical changes and new responsibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from Marcus's personal failure (317 useless repairs) through the mysterious synchronization of broken clocks to his final acceptance of a new calling. The greenhouse discovery provides the key deepening moment where "dead leaves danced in impossible spirals," though the transformation could benefit from one more moment of resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (Mira's struggle with her name's weight) established early and deepens through the coin's transformation sequence. The pressure coheres through Vera's parallel story and the alchemical demonstration, forcing Mira's stance crystallization. Cost is legible in both characters' scars—Vera's literal gold seams, Mira's emotional breaking—though the resolution could push harder against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: Thomas's failed materialization → confession of shame → Mara's deliberate off-key humming that models acceptance → final embrace of broken music. The cost is legible when Thomas accepts imperfection means "worthlessness" yet plays anyway. One meaningful deepening that reweights his relationship to error.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal survival through trauma recall to choosing transformation over escape, with the UV forest sanctuary offering both exile and opportunity. The turn from victim to teacher shows agency, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between remembering trauma and finding its inverse equations.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to cultural preservation as Mira uncovers each painted layer, with the dominant stake (recovering erased histories) signaled early through the "seafaring peoples whose language had been erased." The cost is explicit: these stories can only be made "visible briefly" in fog, not permanently preserved. Mira's agency drives the uncovering through careful knife-work.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from investigating an elevator to uncovering decades of corruption that killed multiple people, with Marcus's choice to engage deepening when he understands his grandmother's role.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bottled whisper creates escalating pressure through its mere existence "destabilizing her perfect system," forcing Moth's choice between maintaining order or embracing rupture. Cost is visible in the library's destruction, though the conflict could benefit from one more intermediate beat of resistance before the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from handling the shard to challenging protocols to demonstrating the ghosts to proposing resurrection. The dominant stake (ownership/interpretation of Venusian artifacts) tightens when Cassia shifts from defensive to offensive with "I'm proposing we stop treating them like artifacts." Cost is visible but could be more concrete - the emotional weight lands but practical consequences remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate from personal craft (repairing the music box) to confrontation with Vex to world transformation, with the wilting sensation and spreading rust providing visceral pressure. Vex's dissolution provides concrete cost. Slightly weakened by the convenient timing of Vex's arrival and his immediate self-destruction through lying.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from collecting ordinary petrichor to discovering interdimensional passage, with clear cost in Vera's choice to be "sensibly eccentric, not foolishly brave."

However, the conflict could tighten further—the opposition between following immediately versus preparing feels slightly underdeveloped in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Marina's need to understand her artistic purpose during crisis—escalates through the slide's revelations and culminates in her sculpture's completion. The storm provides external pressure while the visions deepen internal conflict about isolation versus connection. Cost is visible in her abandonment of GPS certainty for intuitive navigation, though the middle section could benefit from more concrete obstacles to her creative process.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the postcards' meaning—deepens through Mara's discovery that they're instruction rather than documentation. This realization forecloses her solitary artistic path as she joins a generational tradition. The escalation is quieter than typical but appropriate to the accumulative lens, with pressure building through seasonal work toward winter solstice understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on whether revealing compromising truths will destroy the movement's legacy, with escalation through the progression from encrypted diary to temporal trap to physical pilgrimage.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (restoring vs. abandoning the town) escalates through Silas's choice to absorb rather than shatter the bottle, with the transformation process showing deepening commitment. Cost appears in his permanent binding to the town, though the pressure could tighten more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (preserving human emotional range before extinction) is clear early. Pressure builds through the foghorn's silence, the prophetic message, and the northern tower cracking. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through his choice to transcribe rather than flee. Cost is visible in the drowned world and humanity's end.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preserving seeds to wielding reality-altering power, with the acorn cap's revelation tightening options to a single path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes accumulate through the ghosts' urgent gestures and Mara's growing understanding of inherited duty. The tension between speaking and preserving silence creates genuine pressure, though the conflict resolution through understanding rather than action slightly diffuses dramatic force.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal search to humanity's survival in a post-numerical world. The deepening occurs when Marcus discovers the urn fragment contains part of Voss's consciousness and solution. Cost is clear: accepting borrowed time and teaching others means living outside conventional chronology forever.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern accumulation (broken feather → snapped string → torn kite) with one meaningful deepening when Mira transforms the boy's understanding. The cost is legible in his shift from loss to treasure, though the stakes remain relatively gentle without forcing harder trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from groundskeeping job to preventing resort development to mediating interspecies communication, with each copper connection deepening Mira's understanding. The tightening occurs when she realizes "what needed remodeling wasn't the temple, but human perception itself." Cost is visible in her acceptance that dying at the "correct frequency" is her purpose, though the resort threat feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from academic discovery to existential questions about human agency, with clear cost in realizing "We're the experiment." The pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. The tightening from personal discovery to species-wide implications works, though the middle lacks one visceral pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming a battlefield through botanical warfare—escalates from prayer through seed selection to the promise of total consumption. The deepening occurs through accumulation: each dead language adds weight, each plant choice ("heart-vine, memorial grass, and forget-me-spite") intensifies the aggressive reclamation. Cost is visible in the foreclosed human memory: "no one would remember why anyone had thought this shore worth killing for."

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal mystery (child's disappearance) through ancestral awakening to collective salvation, with the leaf's coordinates creating urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal isolation to collective salvation through Kira's growing understanding of her role. The pressure builds through accumulation—whispers of trapped crew, the urgency of their confusion, culminating in her decisive act of becoming their fixed point. Cost is visible in her permanent role as anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from climbing with purpose, to confronting the Keeper's judgment about her master's failure, to the decisive act of amending the chess pieces despite their "priceless" nature. The cost is legible—she destroys irreplaceable knowledge to preserve wonder, fundamentally altering what the pieces represent.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—Marina's choice between official witnessing and preserving small truths—coheres but doesn't significantly tighten until the arrival of the other survivor. The pressure builds through accumulation (her walking-writing ritual, the absent pawns' meaning) rather than causal escalation. The cost appears in her refusal to join the new government, but middle passages meander without increasing pressure under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from searching for lost self to recovering buried talent to creating something unprecedented—plants that help others remember. The stone's arrival escalates through warmth, memory-return, and dissolution into soil. Cost is legible but the middle section could tighten; some passages feel contemplative rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) develops through accumulative pressure as Kaspar decodes the tapestry and recognizes parallel errors. The escalation from observation to active thread-pulling to final understanding follows textural deepening. Cost is visible in accepting his imperfection's permanence, though the resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal defiance to collective liberation as voices multiply through the towers. The three-hour deadline creates urgency, and Kira's discovery of the resonance chamber represents a meaningful tightening that forecloses the Silencers' ritual. Cost is visible: she transforms their instrument knowing there's no forgiveness, only the courage to "speak complexity."

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through physical degradation (cables dissolving, platform tilting) that compresses time and narrows options toward the single choice. The cost is legible as Mira trades her life for the charm's preservation, with agency maintained through her smile at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - understanding artistic purpose and family legacy - deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. The pressure builds from routine disruption through discovery to reconfiguration of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reuniting with Thomas) signaled early and deepens through discovery of his guilt-prison to final materialization. Escalation follows accumulative pattern: releasing scent → climbing stairs → seeing shimmer → touching → solidifying. Cost visible in final state: "not fully human, perhaps never again fully human."

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from general navigation duties to the specific crisis of Marina's brother trapped in the lethal sulfur fields, forcing her to draw on personal experience. The waning moon's effect on her strength creates genuine physical struggle with the manual crank, though this constraint could pressure one more tactical choice. Cost is visible in Marina's permanent separation from those she guides and her resistance to her own cellular longing.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal suffering through involuntary truth to broader social reconstruction, with Mara's agency driving the cure discovery and synthesis. The cost is explicit: choosing when truth emerges creates "a different burden" of discretion versus compulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from investigating a stranger's gesture to recovering one's own stolen memories, with the son's burden-shedding creating reciprocal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal stagnation through the chip's arrival to the doorway revealing "every choice he'd never made," with the Morocco expedition and waiting woman adding concrete cost. The transformation from selling maps to following them lands with clear agency, though one more beat of resistance before entering would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal dreams to kingdom's survival ("Then your kingdom falls tonight, taking every soul with it"), forcing Seraphina's transformation. The grotto's ultimatum provides clear pressure, though the middle section could tighten—the revelation about the great-grandmother's bargain arrives through exposition rather than embodied discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: failed experiment → Marcus's observation about patterns → Lyra's realization → successful creation. The cost is legible in "three years trying" and the grandmother's legacy weight. One meaningful deepening (the reconceptualization) that changes knowledge fits this length well.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from documenting dreams to losing temporal coherence to accepting paradoxical existence. The dominant tension—Maya's struggle with her fractured identity—deepens through accumulated versions of herself. The final moment where "every Maya spread their wings together" pays off the building pressure with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on transforming grief into continued function, with one meaningful deepening when Mara reveals the clock's new water channels mirror Mrs. Huang's grief patterns. Cost is legible but could be more visceral - the emotional terrain remains somewhat abstract despite the physical metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating crystalline formations that physically manifest mounting pressure. The held breath creates a ticking clock that forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable—Kira literally sheds her protective crystalline armor, accepting vulnerability to achieve breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal reconciliation to preserving artistic legacy against the ticking clock of the orchard's destruction. The reversal—possession as collaboration rather than invasion—transforms options meaningfully. Cost is legible in the trees falling and Elisabetta's permanent departure after the requiem's completion.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from witnessing one ending to understanding seventeen as layers of illusion, with the universe's hiccups creating time pressure ("three thousand heartbeats"). The spiral arbitration method forces Kaia to unify opposites through embodied action, though the philosophical resolution slightly dampens visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding what clocks really measure—deepens through the counting ritual from simple numbers to water flow to the grandmother's cryptic "distance" claim, culminating in the protagonist's synthesis. The cost appears in her isolation ("eminently peculiar") and the weight of maintaining obsolete knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from scientific discovery to personal transformation, with Maya's realization about boundaries creating genuine pressure to act. The cost is legible in her vulnerability ("missing you").

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (reconciling mathematical certainty with chaos) signals early and deepens through the stranger's revelation about shared parental addiction. The tightening occurs when two lanterns create "an interference pattern" forcing Elena to accept multiplicity. Cost is legible but could press harder—the acceptance feels slightly too comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—connection through disconnection—develops through Eleanor's call and her admission about forgetting her daughter's voice. The escalation from routine call to existential recognition ("Sometimes I think I made her up entirely") provides meaningful deepening, though the resolution arrives without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate from archival task to moral crisis as Mara discovers Thomas's arson, forcing her choice between pure preservation and truth-telling. Her codicil solution carries visible cost—the "haunted euphoria" of keeping perfect records in an imperfect world.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from Marcus's need to matter through the moon rock exchange to his acceptance of larger purpose. The satellite phone as "exactly one number programmed" creates concrete pressure. Cost manifests in Sadie's revealed methodology—"seventeen floods, nine earthquakes"—though the final transformation could carry more visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through accumulation of languages leading to the stillpoint, with clear escalation as "the platinum compass ring grew warmer" and the melody strengthens. The cost is elegantly rendered in understanding "why she'd been born blind." One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the melody "wasn't leading her somewhere—it was teaching her to become the destination."

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (saving colonists versus preserving discovery) escalates through Mira's realization that accepting the edit means losing crucial knowledge. Cost is visible in the final choice to let another decide. However, the pressure doesn't fully tighten as the anomaly offers a somewhat convenient out rather than forcing Mira to definitively choose.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as accumulative deepening: Maya's solitary ritual → Chen's recognition of the "symphony in negative space" → collaborative translation → acceptance of silence as beginning. The cost is legible in "forty years" of forgotten work and isolation, though pressure could tighten more sharply between beats.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsession to ancestral legacy to humanity's "stolen capacity to make truth permanent," with each discovered artwork narrowing Mira's path toward her destiny. The cost—her isolation, criminal status, relationships as "distractions"—is acknowledged but could be more dramatically tested through present-scene pressure rather than reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Mira's drumming pattern reaches critical mass at "the hush of the universe inhaling." The dominant stake (preserving human consciousness versus harvesting it) tightens when Mira releases her encoded pattern, forcing an irreversible transformation. Cost is legible through her physical dissolution and the system's inversion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving whispered warnings' effectiveness—escalates through the medical supply crisis that forces Chen to rely on Marcus's methods. The geomagnetic storm creates genuine pressure by disabling GPS, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with Chen's immediate conversion after one successful navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Thomas's need to resolve his unfinished confession—establishes early and deepens through Mira's wordless lesson about how "love spoken in actions echoes longer than words frozen by death." The escalation works through accumulation as each shutter configuration builds understanding, though the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than hard-won. Cost registers in Thomas's tears and the weight finally lifting.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—teaching children to think strategically despite authoritarian suppression—escalates through Elena's father discovering her attendance and the imminent confrontation. The synchronized window display represents a meaningful tightening that forces the conflict into the open.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal safety through identity revelation to collective authenticity. The Pacification worldbuilding creates unique non-violent conflict. Mira's choice to unwrap bindings despite vulnerability shows clear cost. The arrival of others slightly dilutes individual stakes at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes emerge clearly: processing illegal grief under surveillance. The whittling demonstration deepens through accumulation—each cut removing "what isn't needed" parallels emotional hollowing. Mrs. Chen's progression from observer to practitioner shows meaningful escalation with visible cost in accepting this "remade hush."

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (completing what Silas started seven years ago) remains vague throughout. While the ban lifting creates opportunity, there's no concrete opposition or tightening pressure—Silas simply performs his art unopposed, without escalating cost or narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from simple barter to emotional revelation as Mira's flower arrangements expose Enzo's hidden grief, forcing him to confront his daughter's absence. The concertina reed becomes the catalyst for reunion, though the daughter's arrival feels slightly rushed for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation reads through accumulative deepening as Vera's improvisation draws unexpected audience and creates "unarchived and unscripted" sounds.

Cost is visible in abandoning her defined role, though the middle section could apply more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—learning to transform grief into purpose—deepens through Elena's interaction with the newly grieving woman, forcing her from solitary craft to active mentorship. The pressure coheres as Elena must demonstrate what she's learned about transformation while still unable to commit to her own phoenix tattoo. Cost is visible in her foreign-feeling smile and the recognition that transformation comes "refined by fire into something both genuinely artificial and absolutely true."

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding cultural survival patterns post-crash—deepens through the Jakarta network revelation, but lacks visceral cost or trade-off. While the discovery reframes understanding, neither Vera nor Marcus faces meaningful opposition or must sacrifice anything to achieve this insight.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly through the seven tiers from preservation to corruption to weaponized trauma, with Mira's choice to absorb rather than steal creating genuine reversal. The cost is visceral in her transformation scene, though the final paragraph's abstraction ("anguished joy would become the seed") slightly dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the shadow's purpose—deepens through frame-by-frame discovery, with meaningful tightening when Mira realizes it followed the stone across decades. The shadow's metamorphosis into the grandmother's dream creates genuine escalation. Cost becomes visible through Mira's tears and acceptance of generational responsibility. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or resistance; Mira's colleagues' dismissal is mentioned but never dramatized as active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (Marina's guilt) through professional (sanctuary closure) to ethical (300 animals needing homes), with each level forcing harder choices. The surgery sequence represents agency through renunciation—removing the modifications despite knowing it ensures the sanctuary's doom. Cost is unmistakable in the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on Maya's search for meaning in her scars, with escalation through the revealed dispersal of the miracle into "ten thousand tiny healings." The tension between seeking closure and remaining open provides genuine conflict, though the resolution arrives through revelation rather than dramatized struggle, limiting the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through psychometric accumulation from single letters to "decades of goodbye letters layering like double exposures" until overwhelming intensity forces Vera's choice. The cost manifests in her necessary professional lie, though the tightening could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal calling to universal creative release, with Lyra's dissolution as the price. The astrolabe growing "heavier, pulling her forward" shows physical escalation. However, no meaningful resistance or complication challenges her path—the journey feels too smooth for maximum tension.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - protecting consciousness fragments from probability pirates - escalates through the pirate confrontation where Kess must use her learned skills to shift reality. The cost is legible: "three years learning the new rules" and existing "partially everywhere." The confrontation forces her to crystallize her stance about cultivating "something necessary" despite the fractured world.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: gear's hum → following it deeper → Loom Tree revelation → placing the gear → forest transformation. The protagonist's agency drives each step with visible cost (nightly translocation, fractured memory). The stakes deepen from personal memory recovery to collective liberation of "untamed thought."

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening—from chasing the dog to boarding the ferry to seeing "every unleashed joy she'd ever denied herself." The star-punch moment creates tangible transformation. Cost is legible in what Marina must release, though the stakes could intensify more sharply in the middle passage where the ferry journey feels somewhat predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from Marcus's physical suffering through the reveal of Elena's presence to her final performance that redefines the fortress's relationship to sound. The cost is visible in surgical scars and seven years of silence. However, the choir's instant voice loss feels slightly convenient, and the middle lacks a strong pressure point before Elena's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from cryptic discovery through urgent warnings to direct confrontation. The pretender breaching the drift itself creates genuine pressure. However, the final confrontation resolves too easily—the pretender simply flees rather than fighting, reducing the cost of victory.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pattern recognition—shadows too geometric, coral formations suggesting streets—until Lena must choose between remaining an observer or diving into the transformed town. The cost of leaving the station's safety for underwater exploration is clear, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal sanctuary-seeking to revolutionary reignition through Kira's discovery of the stones' amplification potential. The dominant stake—whether to risk restarting the failed uprising—tightens as understanding deepens, with visible cost in the "scattered resistance" and "broken promises." Pressure coheres through accumulative resonance rather than confrontation, matching the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal discovery to species-wide liberation with clear tightening as patrols approach during the critical unsealing. The dominant stake (humanity's genetic autonomy) is tested through Chen's choice to release the embryo despite Authority approach. Cost is visible in the irreversible nature of the release.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on finding sustainable response to trauma through cultivation rather than healing. The somatic panic sequence creates internal pressure that the protagonist manages through practiced grounding. Cost is visible in the acceptance that "the world would continue its violence" while she continues planting—a genuine trade-off between seeking justice and finding personal continuance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from artistic failure (mayor's daughter portrait) through existential questioning to accepting a new way of seeing with clear professional cost. The walls pressing closer creates physical urgency that forces Marina's decision to "descend into that darkness." One meaningful deepening occurs when she starts sketching on the cards, transforming passive observation into active reconstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative density—from ink observation to pattern recognition to final understanding—with the eclipse deadline providing temporal pressure. The seven-year pursuit and Tibet avalanche backstory establish stakes, though the resolution lacks a visceral trade-off beyond intellectual satisfaction.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear escalation from letter discovery to network activation to irreversible document release, with tightening time pressure (six minutes vs four). The dominant stake (truth vs institutional loyalty) faces concrete test through biometric confirmations. Cost is legible as Vera sacrifices her position. Minor deduction for security response being somewhat predictable rather than forcing adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether peace can persist amid violence—escalates through the father's unexpected return and culminates in his learning Mira's method. The cost appears in "exhaustion carved into his weathered face" and the choice to sheathe his weapon, though the conflict could tighten further through more active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through Kova's practiced stillness against the echo's testing ("circled her three times"), culminating in the dance of "pulled with silence, the echo resisted with ancient song." The cost lands clearly as Kova becomes permanently changed, though the seven-year preparation slightly diminishes the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from protecting father's reputation to preserving entire empire's foundation ("thirty years of carefully negotiated truces"). The pressure tightens when Margot realizes both accounts are true, forcing her active choice to obscure rather than reveal. Cost is legible in destroying journalistic truth for family legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - translating/resolving the haunted firmware's cries - progresses through clear stages: hearing static, recognizing deleted programs, mapping their constellation. However, there's minimal resistance or complication; Mara simply performs her task successfully. The transformation occurs but lacks the friction that would elevate tension, though the accumulative pressure does build toward crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on understanding the unlearning ritual's purpose, with pressure building through the grotto's whispers, the mysterious voice, and the tile's intervention. The meaningful deepening occurs when the mandala shifts autonomously, forcing Seraphina to accept chaos as meaning. Cost appears in releasing control and accepting impermanence, though escalation could sharpen through more resistance before acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt through divine judgment to communal transformation. The tessera placement forcing visions creates consistent pressure. Cost is visible when "learning the shape of aberrant mercy one tessera at a time" shows the price of her nightly compulsion. Deduction for Brotherhood threat never materializing beyond dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal longing to actively manipulating time, with clear cost when Cornelius commits to the eternal performance loop. The dominant stake (reuniting with Isabella) drives every beat, with echoes accumulating pressure. Minor deduction as the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly once Isabella appears—the "happy ending" lacks a sharper edge of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Maya's need to share her post-accident perception with others, with David's skepticism providing resistance. The crushing of the pill and creation of light corridors marks meaningful escalation. However, the conflict resolves somewhat easily without sufficient cost to David's worldview shift.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from documenting emotional residue to encountering non-human consciousness, with the fossil's dissolution marking irreversible commitment. The entity's thermal communication creates genuine pressure forcing Kira's choice between translator and teacher roles. Cost is visible in losing her unique position. Minor deduction for relatively smooth progression without sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from maintaining an archive to reshaping the nature of fate itself, with the canyon echo's arrival catalyzing the transformation. The dominant stake—preserving versus transforming prophecy—tightens as Mara arranges the buttons and witnesses the warehouse's response. Cost manifests in accepting responsibility for "infinite beginnings" over the comfort of predetermined fate, though the personal price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal survival to nuclear protocols, with Margot's burned status transforming from liability to unique asset. The reversal that her burning was intentional protection narrows her options to acceptance or walking away, with genuine cost in either path.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the woman's approach from uncertainty to trust, with Thomas's offer creating genuine choice: "I can ease it... Not erase." The ticking gutters create temporal pressure that forces action. Cost manifests in what must be released to the river, though the resolution could carry sharper trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure accumulates through the glass's increasing thrumming, the smoke signal creating temporal synchronization, and Mei's growing understanding narrowing to one truth. The cost is legible in "three lifetimes. Or was it four?" and the patient endurance required. Stakes deepen as the revelation transforms from physical discovery to temporal understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through the pattern of endings (dropped petal, abandoned dock, deceased grandfather) that forces Marina to crystallize her stance on cycles. The rowing shell's rhythm provides the cadence shift that synchronizes her breathing and decision, though the stakes could tighten more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—deepens through Kira's recognition that scattered anachronisms must "coexist with absence" rather than recreate the past. The stone circle's intensifying hum creates coherent pressure toward this crystallization. Cost appears in accepting the loss of her mammoth-herder identity while finding purpose in carrying forward extinct wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—revealing connection through art—escalates through Mira's discovery of patterns, Chen's arrival with materials, and their collaborative creation. The cost manifests in their seven-year separation now bridged. However, the conflict lacks sufficient resistance; Chen arrives too readily willing to help.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal discovery to university vote to humanity's safety. The tightening occurs through Maya's counter-broadcasts intensifying as the vote approaches. Cost is legible (equipment glowing with heat, ongoing vigilance). One meaningful reversal when the AI's identity is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure: descent → impossible geometry → organ music → shifting corridors → nexus discovery → transformation. The dominant stake (uncovering the cartographers' spatial rebellion) tightens when Marcus must trust the music despite his claustrophobia. Cost is conceptual but legible—Marcus sacrifices ordinary spatial understanding for revolutionary knowledge. Slightly weakened by the lack of a concrete oppositional force beyond his internal fear.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes accumulate through each portrait revealing victims' dual nature—"generous hands emerging from clenched fists"—building toward the recognition that these weren't random killings but "reunions." The pressure deepens rather than reverses, appropriate for the textural lens, though the killer's specific threat remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal discovery to saving forgotten populations, with the hurricane creating real-time pressure. The revelation about Lydia's true mission meaningfully tightens options, forcing Elara to act before evacuation. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract—"weight of inherited responsibility" lacks the visceral price that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal mystery to cosmic responsibility as Marla discovers her role in granting "pixelated amnesty." The cost is visible in confronting her fragmented selves, though the resolution relies heavily on revelation rather than active choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through Marcus's phased campaign: visual warnings, planted artifacts, acoustic whispers, leading to confrontation. The tension between exposure and education creates genuine pressure. However, TerraLoop's dissolution happens off-page without dramatized struggle, and Chen's too-easy acceptance reduces the cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - understanding the cosmic message and its burden - is signaled early and deepens through accumulation rather than reversal. The pressure tightens when Mira realizes she's part of a generational relay, forcing her choice to document and pass forward the knowledge. However, the escalation occurs primarily through exposition and realization rather than dramatized obstacles, and Dr. Hayashi's presence doesn't genuinely complicate or test Mira's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clear dominant stake (prove innocence or face execution) with escalating pressure through the vortex descent and revelation layers. The cost manifests in accepting dishonor - "victory sometimes meant letting others believe you've lost." One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael discovers the truth requires shattering the confession rather than hiding it.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through textural layering: future-self's warning, the cutting's warming response, spreading maze pattern, until Mira must decide whether to sign. The dominant stake (understanding/healing temporal wounds) tightens as the intersection reveals itself, though the final cost could be more explicitly dramatized beyond conceptual acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to take Elena's destiny and "trammel" her own fate—escalates through deepening understanding from warning to discovery to choice. The cost is legible when Mara accepts the fusion knowing it binds her "forever to another's interrupted story." The apple functions as both complication and resolution with clear agency. Minor deduction for the keeper's appearance feeling slightly staged rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through Marcus's recognition of the specific cloth from his past tour, narrowing from professional appraisal to personal reckoning. The cost manifests in his acceptance of translating rather than escaping his past, though the internal nature of the conflict limits dramatic escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: tablet translation → magnetic field discovery → arbor arrival → seed vision → transformation choice, with each layer adding pressure through the "inheritance" burden. The spirit's departure creates time pressure ("must choose quickly"). Cost is visible in accepting "haunted ambitions of all who came before" though the actual difficulty of this burden remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from Kaine's daily routine to visitor's arrival to the smelting process that "dissolves" past selves. The moon's apex triggers physical transformation in both space ("walls becoming transparent") and bodies. Cost is visible in Kaine's permanent hybrid state, though the visitor's transformation lacks comparable price.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation of confessions leading to Mara's own participation, with clear cost in her admission "I'm terrified of living above ground, where hearts can break." The pearl's increasing radiance provides textural escalation that forces stance crystallization. One meaningful deepening that changes Mara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding self-forgiveness after the drowning incident—escalates through Marcus's interaction with graffiti wisdom, particularly "The river knows what the bridge denies" forcing him to confront his avoidance. His act of drawing his own map including "himself, standing there, failing" represents meaningful agency. The cost accumulates through "five years" of obsessive documenting and medication, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly for the weight of guilt established.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen effectively as the dreamer moves from seeking a hidden library to understanding she must become its eternal keeper. The propagation delays create meaningful pressure by forcing her to document patterns rather than rush through. Cost becomes legible when she realizes her documentation will guide future seekers forever, though the conflict could use more resistance to this fate.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (truth vs. career advancement) escalates from investigation through Marcus's bribe to the violin's supernatural justice. Elara's agency drives the resolution through her calculated deception. The cost is legible as she watches her academic dreams "dissolve like the ice," though the violin's convenient built-in justice mechanism slightly undermines earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.1)
    The Silence's upward creep creates coherent escalating pressure, forcing Mira to work faster as "it rose like a tide of glass." The meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers "how to preserve not just beauty, not just death, but the moment between them," with visible cost in their final flickering state between life and stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding contentment after Chen's betrayal—deepens through the climbing ritual to the encounter with the mysterious woman, forcing Mara to confront whether she guards wisdom or embodies it. The cost of accepting eternal recurrence over individual identity is legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    Central stake (understanding daughter's death) established early and deepens when revealed as Marcus's own culpability in raising her on "absolute morality." The reversal that he killed her with simplicity, not complexity, reframes everything. Cost remains somewhat abstract - "terrible gift of seeing clearly" lacks visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: from counting rings to discovering "the tenth ring...inside the first," to Marcus feeling "the vanishing...it's not disappearing at all." The cost becomes legible when Elara reveals she's spent her "reverse lifetime protecting" this knowledge, though the pressure could tighten more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—mastering navigation through stillness rather than movement—deepens through the revelation that Yula can access temporal layers by remaining a "fixed point." The wandering pulse finding its source provides meaningful tightening, though the internal conflict lacks the visceral pressure expected at this grade level.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal failure through existential questioning to active choice—Mira's step onto mist represents genuine risk with her medallion abandoned behind. The discovery of gardens in the clouds deepens rather than reverses her conflict, and her decision to "carry this brilliant dimness with her" shows agency with clear trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (understanding their synesthetic gift) escalates through journal discovery to acceptance of the luminous vows. Elena's dispersed consciousness provides genuine cost. The revelation deepens rather than reverses, appropriate for accumulative mode, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating understanding - from casting coins to receiving static bursts to recognizing her role as "the universe's memory of expansion." The dominant stake (understanding purpose through backward causality) tightens as each revelation narrows her agency to one inevitable role. Cost is clear: eternal repetition in a causal loop.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes clearly signaled: confronting eternal loneliness after sacrificial love. The crystallization of monsters escalates pressure, forcing the reaper to name specific fears (Absence, Forever). Cost is unmistakable: "never again be seen by living eyes. Never again be remembered." The naming ritual meaningfully tightens options—either succumb to formless grief or transform it through acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from theory to practice, from mockery to vindication, with the critical turn when "The third drop never fell" forcing reality's blur. The cost is legible in Mira's collapse and the partial return ("not all of them, but enough"), though the resolution could show more immediate struggle during the ritual itself.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from professional documentation to moral imperative as Marcus uncovers the suppressed truth about Elena. The "precisely humane lie" creates genuine tension between official narrative and human truth. Minor deduction because the opposition (officials/commissioners) remains abstract rather than embodied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (completing synthesis while preserving wonder) established early and deepens through the starlings' revelation about harmonizing logic/intuition. The choice to sublime the crystal rather than preserve it shows agency with clear cost. Escalation through accumulative pressure rather than reversals fits the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from routine reporting to determining the forest's fate, with Maya's choice to lie creating immediate risk and foreclosing her path back to corporate compliance. The cost is visible in her acceptance of uncertain alliance and continued isolation, though the mysterious caller reduces some agency.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering the ability to feel—is signaled early and tightens through Chen's revelation that the duplicate wants to "vivify" the backup brain. The sparring sequence ("thesis, antithesis, synthesis") provides physical manifestation of the philosophical conflict. However, escalation relies heavily on conceptual revelation rather than dramatized pressure, and the cost remains more implied than visceral at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving wild spaces from "comprehensive development"—is signaled early and tightens through the flower's growth and the space's self-protection. The escalation from solo planting to community gathering to Mira's final understanding that she must teach others shows meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in the nightly dedication and the implied future commitment, though the opposition could apply more direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (restoring joy to the grieving family) is clear from the opening. Escalation builds through the symphony's crescendo and the gradual awakening of laughter in the house above. Cost is visible—three years of accumulated grief requires monthly ritual maintenance. The conflict is primarily situational rather than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from defending texts to personal rescue when the scholar arrives seeking help for a trapped sister, forcing the guardian to choose between safe isolation and risky return. The pendant's warmth recognizing "another traveler between worlds" tightens pressure effectively, though the scholar's quick trust reduces some tension.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate clearly from personal vindication to spiritual transformation, with twenty-three attempts showing persistence under pressure. The cost is visible (blood sacrifice) and the protagonist's agency drives the resolution. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus realizes "the crozier wasn't meant to be restored. It was meant to be reborn."

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (finding the shard of hush) established early and deepens through Maya's discovery that silence contains "not emptiness but potential." The escalation follows accumulative logic as she traces the shard backward through cosmic history. Cost is visible: the fragment exhausts itself, and Maya must choose between Guild monetization and teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—merging fractured timelines—is signaled early through the empty hourglass. Escalation occurs through accumulation of temporal fragments leading to the convergence protocol. However, the woman passenger subplot doesn't meaningfully complicate the main tension, and the resolution lacks a visible price beyond the hourglass shattering—we don't see what Marcus sacrifices or risks in concrete terms.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate through pattern accumulation: from static illusions to fluid ones, from contained weaving to violent eruption across the gallery. The architect's work progresses from testing thread to completing the transformation. Final cost appears in abandoning the labyrinth she created, though middle development could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—learning impossible navigation—is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or reversal. Students transition from skepticism to wonder without resistance or cost. No meaningful tightening occurs; the alien's appearance adds information but doesn't narrow options or force trade-offs. Agency remains purely instructional without foreclosing paths.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from individual catatonia to collective "Silence" affecting seventeen residents, with pressure building through supernatural signals (SOS, birthday dirge, fading photograph faces). The tightening occurs when Mara understands the theft mechanism and must act before voices disappear permanently. Cost is visible in the stolen memories/voices and the spreading contagion of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Tidal deadline creates genuine pressure ("forty minutes...currents would make extraction impossible"), forcing Elena deeper despite claustrophobia. The revelation about the digital threat raises stakes retroactively. Cost is visible in Elena's acceptance of annual pilgrimage duty, though the middle section could tighten between discovery and extraction.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal identity crisis to existential acceptance, with the ink pattern ritual creating tangible risk. The counting accelerates with tension (72→178), though the middle lacks a sharp reversal or deepening that would elevate the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of preserving Thuvenli intensifies through the storyteller's active choices: using the cursed diamond, carving patterns into bone, creating a hybrid language. The escalation from listening to creating to becoming part of the canyon shows clear agency with visible cost. Minor deduction as the middle section could show more struggle or failed attempts before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding and resolving the incomplete transformation of the returned—escalates from investigation to Marina's personal choice to join them. The revelation that "the Thunderbird feeds on" grief and that acceptance enables completion provides meaningful tightening. However, the resolution comes somewhat easily through understanding rather than dramatized struggle, and the cost of transformation remains abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate clearly from personal risk (playing forbidden music) through statue awakening to full orchard rebellion with enforcement squadrons approaching. The music's effect deepens from causing confusion to shattering clockwork hearts to trees uprooting themselves. Cost is visible in Lira "playing herself empty" and the approaching consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from routine mail delivery to contraband smuggling to the revelation of generational healing work. The bottled storm's forty-year journey creates temporal pressure, and Ezra's choice to trust the "absences" demonstrates agency with clear cost—risking his position for human connection.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Emil's silence is ending or possibility—escalates through the fragment discovery, the time-softening moment, and the garden revelation, each narrowing his options toward voice. The cost manifests in his cracking, imperfect song after seven years, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovering the fragment and entering the garden.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories live—accumulates through ritual actions and memories but lacks meaningful tightening. The revelation arrives without struggle or foreclosed options; Marcus simply "finally understood" at midnight without a precipitating pressure that forces this crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: seven years of searching culminates in the smallest, saved island where the figure materializes most fully. The stake—completing grandmother's love vs. preserving her own capacity—sharpens when Mara feels "something leaving her own chest." Cost is visible in her choice to abandon the search and wait for her own beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—freeing humanity's potential from self-imposed fear—establishes early and maintains coherence. Escalation occurs through Vera's physical cost (bleeding fingers) and the textural intensification of the unlocking sequence. However, the conflict lacks concrete opposition beyond abstract "collective doubt," and the resolution arrives without sufficient resistance to fully earn the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal (recovering Gran's memories) to communal (preserving village history) with visible cost in Margaret becoming burdened with "fragments from everyone who'd traded here." The tightening occurs when she discovers Gran's darker motivations. However, resolution lacks agency—the ring simply "gives back" without Margaret facing a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief to understanding systemic resistance under the textural lens. The reveal that Elara teaches survival "when your turn comes" meaningfully deepens the conflict beyond individual rescue. Cost is visible in Kess's transformation and the price both women have paid, though the middle section could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (preserving wonder) is clear from the opening, with pressure building through the ritual of weaving between worlds. However, escalation is primarily descriptive rather than contested - no opposing force threatens the planting, reducing genuine tension. The cost is retrospective (sixty years, the tree's death) rather than paid in the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through accumulation: each unraveled knot releases another fragment, pressure intensifies through the prisms' hum and starlight focus. The cost is legible in "three centuries of tides" and spirits being "unmoored." However, lacks a moment of genuine struggle or choice under pressure—Mira's work proceeds smoothly without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through density increase - from single video to synchronized comparison to UV light revelation to final understanding. The dominant stake (reading unspoken knowledge) deepens through each discovery layer. Cost is legible in Elara's transformation from map-framer to participant in centuries-old conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve or release the library's knowledge—tightens through Marina's discovery of the captain's equations, her understanding of his message, and her decision to surface with only the globe and journal. The air pocket's contraction creates temporal pressure that forces her choice, with cost visible in letting the library flood.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of connection/communication established early and tightens through the storm sequence where Chorus must act in the brief lightning-thunder window. The ghost's need "to remember being remembered" creates genuine pressure. Agency shown through Chorus's invention of the flower press device and choice to teach the ghost. Some escalation could be sharper in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as each floor adds urgency to decoding, though the conflict remains primarily internal discovery rather than external pressure. The cost manifests in Mira's recognition that she must "encrypt her own" joy—accepting isolation as the price of preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving atmospheric memory exists—is signaled early and deepens through accumulated observations. Elena's refusal of rescue helicopters demonstrates agency with clear cost (isolation, danger). The quietly explosive storm's transformation provides meaningful tightening as it releases centuries of memories, though additional pressure points would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure accumulates through the three-hour deadline, each discovery deepening stakes: finding the coin, understanding its spiral of faces, realizing the library's true purpose, then crafting something that transcends physical preservation. The cost lands viscerally as "first demolition machines rumbled closer" while Lyra walks away carrying an internalized sky.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pattern recognition from coordinates to language connections to three-dimensional bird choreography, with each discovery narrowing Elara's understanding. The stakes of preserving lost navigation knowledge emerge clearly, though the personal cost of isolation versus discovery could sharpen further.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes established early (village darkness from failed vault opening) and deepen through prophecy revelations that reframe Elara's understanding. The pressure accumulates through textural density rather than causal reversals, appropriate to the lens. Cost is clear but the escalation could tighten more dramatically in the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The blight creates genuine pressure that forces the families from isolation into desperate collaboration. Marina's messages escalate from cryptic hints to specific instructions, tightening options toward cooperation. The cost—Marina's final fading after completing her purpose—is visible but the agricultural crisis resolves somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from adjusting microseconds to singing time itself into new shapes, with clear tightening as Marcus accepts Eliza's burden. The transformation from mathematical precision to "untrained, cracking" song shows agency accepting imperfection. Cost visible in the irreversible nature of the inheritance and humanity's "terrible love and impossible hope."

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.0)
    The frost deadline creates genuine time pressure ("Three hours, seventeen minutes") that drives pacing. Mara's choice to give away her freedom token (the walnut) represents meaningful stakes. The escalation from hearing the cry to guiding travelers to giving up escape is coherent but could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure builds through Marina's failed text drafts and the foam observation that triggers her shift from rigid to flexible thinking. The stakes (reconciliation with Elena) remain consistent, with cost visible in "six months of drafted texts, deleted" and Marina sitting "down hard," though the resolution lacks substantial resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate when the child requests something "far more dangerous" than ordinary forgetting, with cost visible in how removing endings affects "everything—conversations, meals, heartbeats." The transformation of Merrick's inventory represents genuine consequence, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory-smoothing to absorbing centuries of collective grief, with clear cost ("emotional contagion hit her like a sandstorm"). The choice between walking away or subsuming creates genuine tension. Some softness in how the transformation mechanism works reduces full escalation clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation—first one elevator responds, then more join, then farmers emerge, finally gathering at dawn. The cost is legible in "private grief over failed harvests and mounting debts" transformed through vulnerability, though the resolution feels slightly too complete for the scale of problems introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Vera's transformation into keeper of abandoned dreams—deepens through her neural modifications and the accumulating memories she extracts. Cost is visible in her permanently altered consciousness and the weight of carrying "humanity's interrupted futures." The escalation follows the accumulative lens effectively though could benefit from one more concrete obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the gravity timer and deepening revelations about dangerous knowledge, culminating in Orin's acceptance of the keeper role. The cost is legible in the blood-ink tradition, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring natural sound to a silent world—is signaled early and deepens through Mira's careful extraction process. Escalation occurs through accumulation: single note → harmonizing notes → full symphony. Cost is legible in the porcelain's fractures and the patience required, though the conflict lacks active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through Mira's arrival and question about leaving, forcing Viktor to articulate his discovery about chess as universal language. The "impossible position" on the magnetic board that "sang with hidden harmony" crystallizes the conflict between Academy recognition and deeper truth, though the emotional cost of choosing could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the tightening timeframe (twenty minutes to midnight) and Mara's growing understanding that the lock requires emotional rather than mechanical manipulation. The cost is legible when she realizes some locks open "not with force but with patience." One meaningful deepening that changes her understanding of both the lock and empathy itself.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: mockery from other apprentices, the flower's slow germination responding to Mira's patience, culminating in the overwhelming bloom that tests her sensitive nature. The cost is legible when she breathes deeply of the terrible stench "despite her sensitive nose," though the middle section could tighten the pressure between her ambition and the required patience.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (colony survival through finding resilient crops) escalates from personal search to universal understanding when the Inversion reveals the trees' immunity to gravity changes. The arrow tip's discovery creates meaningful pressure through its temporary effect, forcing Kessa to seek the permanent solution. Cost is legible in the failed colony crops and the paradigm shift required.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the atmospheric anomaly before it consumes more territory—escalates through Maya's deepening disorientation and the revelation of the convergence's expansion rate. The tightening occurs when she discovers Morrison's overlapping footprints "leading both toward and away," forcing her to abandon traditional investigation methods. Cost is visible in the frozen population and expanding threat, though the resolution lacks immediate personal stakes for Maya.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the story establishes clear stakes (bells' destruction, world forgetting wonder), the resolution lacks genuine conflict—Lyrian faces no opposition or difficult choice during her performance. The Council collapses without resistance, making the victory feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal failure through discovery to acceptance of a new role. The pressure builds through silence deepening to "presence rather than absence" and the appearance of the Other Place figure. Cost is visible in accepting the seed and transforming her entire understanding. One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation builds through accumulation as each borrowed personality adds complexity to Mira's internal mathematics, with the halo fragment intensifying the transposition. The dominant stake—preserving human connection through typography as stars vanish—deepens meaningfully, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from artifact delivery to witnessing/participating in the Convergence, with Corvin's fate revealed as willing transformation rather than loss. The cost lands clearly: gaining knowledge means accepting her mentor's absence and new responsibility. One meaningful deepening occurs when her nervousness transforms from liability to essential frequency-matching ability.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is clear from the start and escalates when the prism reveals unprecedented frost patterns. Pressure tightens as morning warmth threatens the evidence. However, the lack of active opposition or complication makes the resolution feel too smooth; coincidence (perfect conditions) enables rather than complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through generational sacrifice pattern to Mei's personal cost, with meaningful deepening as she understands the price. The tension between saving her daughter and losing herself tightens effectively, though the resolution's mechanics (how exactly the message reaches and saves) remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering traded consciousness—emerges through the silk's arrival and deepens in the mine chambers. Korin's agency drives the transformation, with visible cost in the merchant's trembling recognition. However, escalation relies heavily on conceptual accumulation rather than concrete pressure points, and the merchant's transformation happens too quickly to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through universe-hopping that narrows toward the nexus point, with the revelation about map makers' destructive impact raising stakes significantly. The cost of their gift creating "microscopic tears" that collectively destroy universes is unmistakable, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from mysterious letters to discovering Jonas is dead to understanding all keepers are trapped souls, each revelation narrowing Elsa's options. The dominant stake—preventing loneliness from consuming both living and dead—crystallizes when she must choose to tend the light. Cost is visible in forsaking her boat captain life.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through three increasingly difficult ships, with the third forcing Mira to confront her mirror-self in a moment that redefines her purpose. The dominant stake (navigation between worlds) tightens when she must harmonize with her inverse twin. Cost becomes visible when ancient shadows take shape, though the transformation feels somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal discomfort with the transplanted heart to understanding its magnetic pull for stories, culminating in the choice to become a transformer rather than collector. The pressure coheres through accumulation—each revelation about the donor adds weight until Kael must choose his path. The cost of "quietest explosions" in transformation is made tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through Marcus's recognition that his maintenance serves emotional rather than mechanical purposes. The pressure builds through accumulation—from physical repair to mathematical translation to understanding trees' temporal perspective. The cost manifests in accepting transformation over preservation, though the conflict could benefit from more immediate physical obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory-keeping to communal survival through the accumulation of shared dawn memories into collective action. The tightening occurs when individual fragments coalesce into community singing that physically transforms the realm. Cost is legible in the permanent shift from passive dawn to active creation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation occurs through density increase: from Ezra's solitary reading to overwhelming empathetic pain to the choice between hiding and helping. The midnight transition creates temporal pressure. Cost is visible in "feeling too much to help, yet unable to stop feeling."

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from mysterious bread to understanding Lila's role as witness/absoluter of the impossible. The tea house revelation meaningfully tightens options - Lila must continue this work or abandon the sacred things needing form, with clear cost in lifelong commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulating loss—slides flickering at edges, ice cracking underfoot, library groaning—with the founder's slide discovery providing meaningful deepening that reframes the preservation task. The ticking clock of collapse creates coherent pressure, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate causally from failed infiltrations to the watch fob reveal that forces Mae's final choice between mission and belonging. The dominant stake—capturing evidence versus maintaining bloodline trust—tightens when the woman recognizes the federal badge, foreclosing Mae's option to remain. Cost is legible in "could never return." Minor deduction for the shipment stakes feeling slightly abstract compared to the personal betrayal.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from Marina's skeptical investigation to discovering her inherited weather-carrier nature, with meaningful deepening when the other carriers arrive and reveal the truth. The cost is legible in her lifetime of denial being overturned, though the forest election feels like a parallel rather than integrated pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: finding paint, discovering paintings, then creating directly on stone with "charcoal and tears." The dominant stake (creative expression vs. safe reproduction) tightens when Lyra abandons her sketchbook for direct creation. Cost is visible in losing perfect recall of her own work. Slightly convenient timing of discovery prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: postal fragment → map pieces → intercepted communications → grandmother's crystallized confession about the water diversion. Each discovery narrows Vera's options toward the inevitable choice between maintaining peace or delivering truth. The cost is explicit: dissolving the city's "carefully maintained peace" and accepting that "some truths were worth wilting for."

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The melting iceberg creates legitimate time pressure that escalates from preservation attempts to the decisive sacrifice, with clear cost in losing the last physical piece of pre-change world. The stakes deepen when Mariel realizes the bells can hold what refrigeration cannot, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation as each fear burns in sequence, creating "miniature suns" that must be precisely contained. The dominant stake—resolving internal static without destroying the dome—tightens as M-47 discovers the fires must feed into the android's own root system, though the final transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (Elena's healing through recovered letters) progresses smoothly but lacks meaningful resistance or complication. The resolution arrives through helpful neighbors making phone calls without obstacles—no competing priorities, failed attempts, or prices paid. The conflict resolves through collective goodwill rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through Maya's dance revealing increasingly complex encrypted data, with the reversal sequence demonstrating "mastery over both creation and undoing." The dominant stake of decrypting forbidden knowledge carries cost in the world learning "what Dr. Elena Voss—her grandmother—had truly discovered." Pressure coheres but lacks a sharp foreclosure of options that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost memories of Elena—tightens through Marina's pattern recognition leading to the cemetery dig. The escalation from noticing coffee ground patterns to excavating memory vials creates meaningful pressure, with Marina's choice between full reclamation and selective integration providing genuine cost. The gravity pockets' increasing influence tracks with emotional intensity, though the whale's connection to the accumulated grief could be more causally explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the prophecy's resistance ("struggled against her work") and fragments breaking free. The cost is legible - choosing dispersal over destruction, accepting solitude. One meaningful deepening occurs as she guides the prophecy into the brook for dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from borrowed sugar ritual to Marcus's revelation about his grandmother, then crystallize in his request to learn—each step narrows their options for maintaining distance. The cost of abandoning pretense is legible. However, external pressure remains gentle; the conflict stays primarily internal without a forcing crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from whispers to coordinates to full memory recovery, with Marina's digging representing agency against the Institute's imposed emptiness. The cost is clear—accepting both "grief and grace" rather than sanitized peace. Minor deduction for the relatively smooth progression without significant resistance or complication in the recovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from impersonal forgeries to her brother's life, with clear tightening when she must choose between condemnation and salvation documents. The cost of her final choice—exposing twenty years of work—is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal mystery to existential choice as the shell reveals the pattern of disappearances and Senna faces joining or refusing the eternal chorus. The melancholy of understanding ("sorrow, not joy") deepens pressure, and the final transformation carries clear cost of individual identity.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: whispers→frost faces→visions→chemist materialization→formula revelation, with Marina's recognition that "every wreck she'd explored had been practice" foreclosing her option to refuse this calling. The cost of perpetual dangerous diving is legible, though the middle section's dream-cameo exposition slightly dampens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recognizing and valuing hidden effort—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. Tension builds through layered discoveries (firefly patterns, whisk revelations, net geometry) that reweight the protagonist's understanding. The cost is primarily conceptual/philosophical rather than dramatic, which fits but lacks the visceral pressure of higher-scoring work.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from scientific curiosity to moral crisis as each reconstructed letter tightens Marcus's dilemma between his debunking mission and preserving life-saving sanctuary. The cost manifests in his abandonment of exposing truth—his life's work—though the personal price could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating signal intensity—from binary clouds to the Prophet's humming on dead channel 107.3, culminating in his voice on "every dead frequency." The storm's progression mirrors this intensification, though the protagonist's agency remains primarily receptive rather than driving change.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving vanishing stories—deepens when Marcus realizes finding the music box's owner will complete his transformation. Elena's revelation about Anthony creates genuine emotional cost ("I was so angry at him for dying"). The escalation from personal collection to public archive shows meaningful tightening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from routine maintenance to species-level covenant through accumulative pressure. The Collectors' arrival creates a ticking clock ("Time was running short"). Mira's agency drives the resolution—she chooses dissolution over preservation. The cost is visceral: losing human form to become "a living wave." One meaningful deepening occurs when the artifact's removal would "silence every lighthouse from here to Greenland."

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation - from solo waiting to coordinated twelve-sanctuary action, from tracking paths to placing rods, from individual patience to collective transformation. The seventy-three hour window creates genuine pressure, though the arrival of Tomás slightly deflates tension by confirming success rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from investigating a death to confronting systemic bondage across time, with Margot's career as the price. The accumulation of memories creates pressure that forces her transformation. Yet Jerome's conflict with his supervisor remains told rather than dramatized, weakening the modern parallel to historical slavery.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of whether Eliza can transform Thomas's apology into healing escalates through the repair process, with tension in "Will you stay? I might need—another perspective." The cost lands in accepting help from someone connected to her brother's execution, though escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pioneer's drive to transcend mechanical function escalates from tinkering to wing transformation to the final dive, with the acid sea providing constant mortal stakes. The transformation carries visible cost as she risks dissolution, though the middle section's philosophical discussions dilute momentum before the climactic action recovers it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from missing person case to discovering an entire shadow network to choosing transformation. The dominant stake (finding the truth about disappearances) tightens when Lila realizes her father's fate connects to the pattern. Cost becomes legible when she "created her own breadcrumb trail" before pressing enter. The personal cost of becoming archived lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether anomalies serve violence or peace—establishes early and deepens through mirror revelations showing the merchant's shattered denial transformed into "countless gentle teachings." Mira's choice to become gardener rather than enforcer shows agency with cost. However, escalation relies heavily on revelation rather than active pressure, and the keeper poses no real opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - Marlene's relationship with endings - deepens through her vigil at the marina, with the ice's progressive breaking creating natural escalation. The cost is visible in her choice to remain rather than seek another ending, though the conflict could benefit from more immediate pressure beyond observation.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation—from Marcus's last evening, to the revealed romance, to Elena's daughter seeking his wisdom. The "impossible wine" that "shouldn't exist" provides tangible proof of Marcus's philosophy. Cost is clear in decades of solitude, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily through Elena's daughter's initiative rather than Marcus's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving wisdom echoes—is established but tested only through summarized action. The urgency ("We must act tonight") lacks concrete pressure beyond the prophet's arrival. No meaningful obstacles complicate the consecration work; the characters simply perform their task without visible trade-offs or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preserving memory (town council will "clear these ruins next month") to completing intergenerational healing work. The pressure deepens as Elara discovers the spiral pattern requires active participation, not just preservation. Cost is visible in the descendants' tears and the transformation of "inherited pain into beauty."

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from private discovery to public testimony, with the Committee's arrival forcing Elena from observation to action. The crystal's revelations deepen pressure—showing language's "secret life" creates undeniable evidence she must present, though the confrontation itself could carry more immediate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding "the frequency of age" in degraded recordings—escalates through the woman's arrival fulfilling Ezra's morning prophecy, their collaborative search, and discovery of the grandmother's voice. Cost manifests in Ezra's perpetual forgetting and the chalk wearing away. The accumulative pressure builds but lacks a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from mechanical failure to existential choice—whether to escape like the previous keeper or remain as guardian. The clock's acceleration creates genuine pressure ("approaching their own escape velocity"), and Ezra's use of the tuning fork represents agency that narrows options. Cost is visible in accepting perpetual suspension between states, though the middle could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Maya's terminal diagnosis creates immediate stakes that escalate through her project of transforming hospice sounds into art, culminating in the public performance where "they heard themselves reunified." The cost lands clearly in her walking away "toward whatever came next" after demonstrating how to live with "knowledge of the end." One meaningful deepening through the vinyl project that reframes death/life.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal investigation to universal threat as noon approaches and shadows stream toward "Origin." The pressure tightens when Lyra realizes she must seal gaps rather than merely observe, though the resolution relies heavily on successful rune-tracing without dramatized struggle or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through the revelation pattern - the substitute body's purpose, Mother's knowledge, Elara's transformation - each deepening Thomas's understanding. The dominant stake (accepting what sister has become vs yearning for what was) tightens when he must choose whether to keep or return the tooth, with visible cost in letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to community survival as fishing boats need guidance through fog. The glass's activation represents meaningful deepening that changes Marina's options. Cost is legible in the three months of searching and the weight of inherited responsibility, though the resolution comes slightly easy.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes deepen from personal (viral exposure) to relational (Marcus's guilt) to philosophical (converting witnesses to gardeners). The ice-pattern discovery provides the accumulative turn that reweights prior damage. However, Marcus poses no real opposition or complication—his immediate acceptance reduces potential friction that could have heightened the transformation's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through pattern recognition—each ephemeral visitor to the nexus deepens Marina's understanding until she must choose between completing her manuscript conventionally or releasing it to its own form. The escalation from observation to participation to renunciation narrows her options with each accumulated example.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal (Elara's attempt) to communal (village restoration) with the harvest moon as temporal pressure. The vine's physical response ("shivered," "pulsed," "uncurl") provides tangible feedback that deepens commitment. Cost is legible but could be sharper - we see transformation but limited struggle beyond "voice cracked with emotion."

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: six weeks gathering, eight weeks understanding weight, two weeks listening to trees, all building to the "delicate moment" where "wind stopped, even the aurora above froze mid-undulation." The seventeen-hour heartbeat creates temporal pressure that forces micro-adjustments. Cost manifests in the months of patient work and the orchard's permanent alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding versus repairing the mechanism—intensifies through Mara's discovery that the device stores actual time rather than recordings. The escalation from physical observation to temporal perception (hearing tomorrow's footsteps) deepens pressure. Her final choice to preserve brokenness carries clear cost: forsaking conventional repair for deeper understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation reads as textural deepening from personal grief (grandmother's seventeen grams) to cosmic weights (mountains dreaming, oceans remembering) to the meta-weight of the grotto itself. The dominant stake—understanding imprisonment through weight-collection—tightens once when she grasps "the weight of weightlessness," though agency remains primarily contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake of how to carry love forward after loss deepens through the carving process, with the kettle deadline creating mild temporal pressure. The shift from believing love was temporary to recognizing it crystallizes shows meaningful deepening. However, lacks a sharp reversal or heightened cost moment beyond steady accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of reconciling past ambitions with present reality escalates through ghost confrontation and fragment accumulation. The carousel stopping after seventeen years creates meaningful pressure that forces Kira's stance crystallization. Cost is visible in accepting transformation rather than restoration, though middle development could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from academic curiosity to existential discovery about human aspiration. The pressure builds through Maya's physical work and intellectual breakthroughs. However, lacks external opposition or meaningful risk beyond intellectual failure - the discovery comes too easily once she begins.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    The letter creates pressure that forces Elara to confront her loss, with escalation through memory accumulation leading to her decision to "bear both worlds." Cost is visible in splitting her time between sanctuary and Conservatory. However, the conflict lacks present-scene opposition - mostly internal reflection without external pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—how to honor memory without being trapped by grief—deepens as Marta decodes the tapestry's message about "grief transformed into devotion." The chess clock running down marks a threshold crossed, though the middle lacks active resistance to her discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through environmental pressure—from quiet exploration to frantic documentation as "droplets began forming on the ceiling."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)

The lack of a direct external antagonist on the page keeps pressure modest, but the ethical calculus lands.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming music through thermal response) is clear, and pressure deepens through concrete trials (fork to glass, 432 Hz choice). The escalation is lyrical rather than adversarial but registers as a decisive intensification by night’s end. The price is internal (accepting loss while reframing it), though no option is visibly foreclosed beyond grief’s endurance. Earned cadence shift at dawn supplies sufficient tightening for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—granting rest—tightens when the librarians’ burden reframes the goal from retrieval to ritualized release. The decisive deepening comes with repurposing the lens and teaching rites, culminating in Silas’s choice to remain, which forecloses his old life.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (dignified survival under sanctions) are legible early, and pressure coheres via the nightly ritual’s growth and the officials’ intrusion. Escalation is a density increase rather than a sharp reversal, fitting the chosen lens. The on-page price is her step-back and maintained anonymity; costs are felt but gentle. A single tighter pinch point would have raised the sense of narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)

Still, agency drives the key turn.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is focused (hear betrayal’s sound), and pressure coheres via the forge ritual and the graveyard of ships as thematic counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal and communal—can this space hold fear and inquiry—tightened by the couple’s arrival and question. The escalation is modest but coherent: ritual → installation → public test.

Still, the handover of the warm sphere under scrutiny reads as a credible test of her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (agency over identity/memory) tightens when Jake triggers reset and Marcus counters with the reversal—an earned escalation driven by his choice.

No coincidence resolves the conflict; tactics arise from prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can she face the approaching night and what it demands—tightens with the star’s falter and the held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—locating the origin of thought—is present and tightens when the temporal awareness and the violin converge.

Absence of a sharper counter‑pressure keeps it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (can they re‑enter trust?) is signaled early; pressure tightens through confession and counter‑confession.

Nevertheless, the internal conflict deepens into a believable choice at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—growing life against a low Luck Index—is clear and steadily pressured by “2.1” and prior inspection.

The ending is earned but light on visible price or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: completing the ghost composition.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to handle an impossible truth—is signaled early and tightens when the aurora descends, forcing a stance between official record and marginal preservation.

Pressure is accumulative rather than antagonistic, but it coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the ethical stake: exploit, take, or witness and leave. Escalation is a single but meaningful tightening—clearer radio signal → confession about theft → physical discovery—culminating in an on-page trade-off (public proof vs disturbance). The price is the relinquishment of claim and the acceptance of haunting responsibility. Stakes remain internal but tangible; no flab or soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—maintaining witness without judgment—remains coherent, and the mushroom-words plus the swan-as-map form a meaningful deepening. Still, pressure is gentle; options aren’t visibly narrowed beyond the ongoing renunciation of speech/ecology protection. The final stance is an earned endurance rather than a hard trade-off, with cost implied more than dramatized in a turn. Effective for a lyric mode, but not sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    The countdown to totality tightens pressure, and the choice to let go is the clear, escalated turn. Stakes are intimate—wonder, legacy, relinquishment—and the cost is felt without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: make meaning from remnants and steward humanity’s memory as the axis displaces. Pressure tightens via a decisive deepening—the tapestry/diary alignment reframes dragons and reality’s centerline; her consciousness “slides,” forcing a stance. The culminating choice to archive and continue the work forecloses retreat into mere wonder; she accepts the solitary burden. Cost remains more conceptual than visceral but is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self‑orchestration toward disappearance—is clear, and pressure accumulates via the island’s dangerous omniscience and the beam’s “TRANSCEND” signal.

Escalation is purposeful though quiet, leaning on pattern rather than overt confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (free the woman before completion) is clear, and pressure coheres via density—layered loops and paradoxes that unwind the demon.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (conduct before exhaustion) is clear and tightens through the live clock and the dawn intensification. The fortunes’ lift and the horizon’s fold provide a single decisive deepening that narrows her options to now. Cost is present but not foregrounded; the escalation is emotional and formal rather than adversarial. The resolution grows from her agency (conducting) rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—choose integration at the cost of unlived lives—is signaled early and tightens via pressure (darkening, grasping shadows, fragmentation). The elder Kira scene heightens the moral calculus and removes the refuge of indecision. The “collapse/unite” act is a credible, high-cost turn driven by her agency. Stakes remain coherent and internal/external pressures interweave effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (thawing numbness) tightens through the intensifying somatic resonance and the machine’s dwindling energy.

Escalation is quiet but coherent for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving truthful records under oppression—is clear early and intensifies with the hidden note and surveillance memory. The meaningful tightening arrives with the second message, reframing her role and forcing a recommitment with new risk and tactics. On‑page cost remains mostly conceptual; no concrete loss or immediate consequence is shown. Still, tension rises at beat and story scales.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether to open and absorb the vial’s cost, tightening as scents intensify and personal history surfaces. The escalation is a density increase appropriate to the chosen lens, culminating in a stance crystallization. The price—carrying the archive of losses—is legible and ongoing. A single sharper on‑page resistance beat could have heightened the narrowing of options further.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres via accumulating moral revelations that reweight Marcus’s choices; the key tightening comes as the final layer reframes guilt and reparation, prompting his renunciation. Stakes stay primarily internal, but the beings’ appetite for complexity adds a live pressure to keep going. The price—choosing to leave the rope and carry the burden of understanding—registers, though it could be edged with a sharper on‑page trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes center on whether sound—and by extension communal life—can reform from damage; escalation arrives through density: solo to ensemble to communal ritual. The tightening is quiet but real: a deliberate rejection of polished restoration in favor of incomplete emergence. Visible prices (damaged instruments, offerings instead of money, abandonment of “old songs”) register. A stronger moment of friction would lift pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around two forces: the live clock (grotto sealing) and the temptation to subsume. Escalation arrives via intensifying static and the nearing close of the window, forcing a choice that forecloses self-indulgence. The outcome is earned by her rule and method—no deus ex machina. The price is felt but remains internal, keeping the tension quiet rather than wrenching.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Margot remains a purely transactional broker or steps into stewardship—tightens through the delivery choice and its consequences. Escalation is modest; obstacles are minimal (Captain agrees; Martha is receptive), so the price is more reflective than contested. Still, the move from private ledger‑minding to public advocacy is a credible narrowing of identity. The final cadence reads as earned deepening rather than hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—belonging through art/community memory—is signaled early; escalation comes via the communal mapping ritual culminating in the descent. Agency is steady, but opposition is minimal and the price of “dedicating too completely” remains mostly thematic rather than dramatically tested. The turn at “the tags form a path” is effective, yet the search proceeds smoothly, softening pressure. Resolution is earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (free the trapped time-creatures vs. city’s borrowed minutes) tightens as she nears the giant’s throat and discovers the theft. The decisive escalation is her choice to complete the drawings, triggering a visible loss for the city and forcing a new cadence. Agency drives the turn; cost is unmistakable (panic of sculptors, loss of minutes, pendant damage). One coherent deepening rather than multiple reversals fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular: resolve ambiguous loss by testing Elias’s theorem. Escalation is a textural intensification (humming trees, fungi ripples) keyed to Morrow’s agency in precise placement, culminating in the voiced pattern and her reoriented question. The cost is subtle but present in accepting a non-binary return and leaving the eyes behind. Pressure remains coherent, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (visibility through trust) tightens via the outage and the archivist’s direct address. The reveal of her tape player is a meaningful deepening that reweights options. The decision to share the cache tomorrow is a stance crystallization with a felt risk. Tension is quiet but persistent, cohering under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to resist or yield—tightens as the leaf begins to merge, forcing a choice with visible cost. Escalation is internal but legible (glowing moss, prehistoric ferns, bodily signs) and culminates in a single, consequential action: releasing control. The lack of an antagonist doesn’t blunt pressure because the environment serves that role. A touch more external friction could have sharpened the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres via the ticking tide and the emotional trade-off of the heirloom; the tightening is the imminent submergence and the once-only exchange. While there’s no reversal, the cost and narrowing options are unmistakable. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential and resolve through Mara’s agency. Slightly low jeopardy keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on whether Vera can function without her usual foresight and reframe what magic is. Pressure deepens as the voice reframes her assumptions and the shadows coalesce, culminating in her deliberate inhabiting. The price is primarily conceptual (surrender of control and previous identity), not peril‑based; escalation is measured rather than sharply tightening. Effective but low‑voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes focus on whether meaning can be recompiled from absence, with pressure deepening via discoveries (light reveals, valve telegraph) and culminating in opening the archive and the final sigh. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens; no sharp reversal, yet the cadence tightens into a ritualized closure. Costs are conceptual rather than visceral, which limits intensity but suits the design.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake—will she follow through and cross—and tightens via sensory escalation and spatial distortion. The wall of mist is a clear gate that requires a deliberate act with a specific tool. Stakes remain mostly internal; resistance is atmospheric rather than adversarial, so cost feels gentler. Still, the commitment to return functions as an earned narrowing of her life’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to integrate mysticism and empiricism under a migration clock—is clear and tightens through the warming tile and escalating transcription. The three-day window and the “last whale” provide a meaningful cadence shift. Escalation is internal but coherent; cost is the foreclosing of a purely skeptical path. Pressure remains gentle, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—step toward an irreversible beyond—stays coherent, and the storm’s intensification provides a single meaningful tightening. Yet opposition is light; no counterforce or real trade-off tests resolve, so cost feels mostly conceptual. The escalation is adequate rather than bracing. The finale is earned but could use one on‑page price or foreclosed option to deepen tension.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reparation and rightful ownership—is signaled early and tightened when Maya reveals the ashes and the envelope, forcing a trade weighted by cost. Escalation is a deepening rather than big reversal, consistent with the lens, and Wei’s stance crystallizes under the pressure of unexpected honesty. The price (relinquishing legacy objects and accepting burial) is on the page. Slight softness in external jeopardy keeps it from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (recovering erased histories) is present early and the pressure tightens as dawn nears and the hum strengthens. Escalation is a density increase rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. The felt price (fatigue, restraint, the acceptance of unending work against institutional erasure) is present but subtle. One meaningful deepening lands at the dawn threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (claiming an identity among the erased) crystallizes under pressure when the spring tide’s message forces a stance, leading to her three‑part signature. The escalation is a density/recognition deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate for the lens. The felt price stays subtle—no external penalty, mainly the irrevocable self‑definition—which keeps tension refined but contained. Still, the tightening is real and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Marina’s professional identity versus the lure of belief—tightens as the phenomena escalate and Claudia reframes the myth. The decisive deepening is Marina moving from testing to bowing to agreeing to help, a value trade‑off. Cost is present but soft (no external jeopardy), leaning on internal renunciation. Pressure remains coherent and builds toward a clear stance.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (survive gentrification) is clear early; escalation tightens with the developers’ arrival and the community’s rapid reorganizing pivot. The plan forecloses the fight‑them‑directly path, and the graffiti‑legal synthesis feels like a genuine narrowing of options. The visible price is muted—less a loss than a strategic reframing—so the tension doesn’t quite peak. Still, agency drives the turn and the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last emergence before the ice exhausts—is signaled early, with countdown forces (chemical timer, supply rocket) shaping tactics. The meaningful tightening occurs as the vapor finally appears and passes, foreclosing the possibility of future documentation. Cost is conceptual and emotional rather than physical, but it’s legible in the renunciation of the outpost. The conflict is quiet yet coherent for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is present early and coherent: fix the beacon before departure. Escalation comes via the countdown and the precision-demanding patch, with a clear tightening when the membrane requires exact pressure. However, jeopardy feels controlled; few reversals or visible costs test her limits. Resolution is earned but not hard-won enough for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (protecting or revealing the discovery) tightens with the inspector’s arrival and recognition of the window pattern. The decision to share forecloses concealment and creates future risk. Stakes remain intimate but coherent; the emotional and professional costs are legible if mostly implied. A small on‑page complication or loss would intensify the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring the town’s heartbeat—is signaled early and deepens as more townsfolk join, leading to structural repairs as consequence. Escalation is coherent but gentle; skepticism never truly bites, and the mayor’s resistance poses little on‑page pressure. The tightening occurs through density of participation rather than hard trade‑offs. Cost is implied as ongoing ritual rather than a felt sacrifice in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (escape vs eternal absorption) are signaled early and tighten as the vial dwindles and the sanctum reframes options. The decisive deepening is her turn “not up but deeper,” which forecloses the escape path. The price—abandoning her daughter and life—lands on the page. Pressure remains coherent with one meaningful escalation suited to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are legible (clear a legacy of murder by deception before authorities arrive), and the ticking clock tightens the window. The meaningful turn is Marcus choosing testimony through the lattice, transforming a confessional into a recorder of truth. Opposition is largely ambient; no on‑page counterforce tests him beyond time and access. The cost and narrowing of options are present but soft, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—freedom versus binding love—is legible early, and pressure deepens with the “tonight” clock and the bead’s heartbeat. The tightening culminates in the crack that forecloses the garden’s unnatural persistence. Agency skews to the ghost bride at the peak, slightly softening the test of Marlow’s commitment. Nonetheless, the escalation reads as coherent because/therefore causality with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accrues via pattern density rather than antagonism; the key deepening is the discovery/use of overlap points and the plate warming into animation. Stakes remain largely conceptual—transformation vs. restoration—so the price and narrowing of options are soft. The noon/tide window hints at a clock but doesn’t pinch tactics decisively. The escalation still coheres under the accumulative lens with a clear cadence shift when the children move.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure tightens from passive return to active recommitment when the gnomon appears and the names are revealed. The conflict is internal and situational, cohering without an antagonist. Stakes are personal—purpose versus drift—and escalate appropriately under the accumulative lens. The price is quiet but real: choosing labor and rooted time over suspended journeys.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are largely contemplative: complete the pseudonym before mailing, honor a client’s hidden desires. The clock and ritual deepen mood but do not force trade‑offs or foreclose options beyond “finish and file.” There’s no escalation beat that narrows choices or extracts a visible price. The piece succeeds as a tone‑poem but runs low on pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are signaled early (thwart the coup by smuggling intel); pressure tightens when Crane announces the closure and confirms the timeline. Escalation is driven by Vera’s covert agency, not coincidence, and her disguise strategy remains under test. The cost is risk and endurance rather than an on‑page sacrifice, keeping the climax quiet. Still, the narrowing window provides a credible squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (risking apology) is clear; tension tightens when the panes reveal three messages and she must choose, narrowing options. The escalation is internal but not static: choosing the third window and speaking the confession raises cost. The price is tangible (loss of the shard) and relational (accepting culpability) and drives the outcome. External antagonism is minimal, but the ritual pressure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming meaning/purpose from trauma—tightens as the translation act becomes communal and culminates in the irreversible gift of the coral. Pressure coheres through the child’s need and Maya’s pain/guilt, with the bridge-and-phrase serving as the turn that reweights options. The price is visible (relinquishing a talisman, enduring pain), though the conflict remains quiet by design. No false resolution; the ending accepts ongoing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering and displaying joy against the fog’s erasure—is clear, and pressure accumulates as the network amplifies her act. The meaningful tightening is the realization of transience: the joy won’t last, yet she must still display it. However, the on‑page cost is conceptual rather than felt as a trade‑off; there’s no foreclosed option beyond accepting impermanence. Tension remains low‑grade and lyric rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—certainty vs. curiosity—tightens as the coin triggers the temporal pause and proliferating options. The decisive turn (restore the cycle rather than decode it) narrows paths with a conceptual price. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but coherent under the chosen lens. Pressure is elegant if gentle, with limited external jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (protect the clandestine language operation) is signaled early and tightens when the auditors triangulate and pound on the door. Marcus’s choices escalate in coherent steps (mantises → moths → locusts), foreclosing his own safety to enable the plan. The price is legible as he faces the breach alone; the trade‑off is clean and consequential. One beat of tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (ending a beauty/pain war through transformation, not victory) is clear and deepens as others arrive and the shell becomes a greenhouse. Pressure is largely textural; escalation comes via the growing community and the turn from weapons to nutrients. Visible price exists but is diffuse (centuries of insomnia/erosion rather than a singular gambit). One strong tightening is the permanent armistice “through practice,” but the scene avoids a sharp on-page crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is focused: capture the name before the chime fails. Escalation is clean and on‑page—the lighting widens the crack, tightening the clock and forcing quicker, risk‑accepting work. The price (loss of the chime) is felt, and agency resolves the conflict. A single, strong deepening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stakes (war vs. reconciliation) are declared early, and the countdown to the summit adds pressure. Escalation is mostly internal/epistemic (decoding shift, glow revelation) rather than antagonistic, with minimal on‑page resistance. The risk of worsening the divide is acknowledged but not concretely tested. The final commitment to present the score reads earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is focused (reconciling water rights) and the pressure coheres as Mara commits to a plan that will compel collaboration. Escalation is quiet but real: resin clue → trembling recognition → irreversible inscription and anonymous note. The cost is more conceptual than visceral; no live counterforce on the page presses back. Still, the plan forecloses paths and forces a trade‑off, satisfying this length.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can she reinvent without denial?—is signaled early and deepens as she chooses omission/reorganization over forgery. The meaningful tightening arrives when Theodore reveals prior knowledge and the preserved letter; it forecloses pure erasure and demands a stance. Stakes remain intimate but coherent under the accumulative lens; the price is acceptance of history. Quiet but earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reaching/understanding the threshold of loss—is clear, and pressure coheres as pattern density increases toward the center. Escalation is primarily textural rather than adversarial; the maze “recognizing” her thins friction and reduces felt cost. The decisive deepening (discovering the thermal/pressure anomaly) narrows options conceptually, not physically. Earned, but a touch gentle for peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accrues via the rare alignment and the city’s “luminous respite,” culminating in a cadence shift as fish and jellies reweight meaning. Stakes remain internal and observational; there’s no firm narrowing of options beyond watch vs. measure, and no visible price exacted in scene. The escalation is beautiful but gentle, consistent with the accumulative lens yet light on cost clarity. The key turn is Chen abandoning instruments to witness, which is thematically apt but low‑risk.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is present (gather before memory fades; comprehend vanishing paths), and pressure tightens modestly through the cave dimming and the glass warming to a presence. The major turn is a deepening of meaning rather than a reversal: sprouts reconfigure the question of disappearance. Costs are understated (leaving, enduring mystery) but legible. The tension operates more texturally than through escalating jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—making connection and earning through orchestrated wonder—tightens with the teen’s arrival and the approaching tide. Escalation is a density increase rather than a sharp reversal, consistent with the chosen lens. The teen’s contribution (a guitar pick) marks a small but concrete outcome. Costs remain soft (time/stamina/limited window) rather than a foreclosed path, keeping the ceiling lower.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure grows through density: dust multiplies, starlight gathers, the “by dawn” clock surfaces, and the cost becomes inescapable. The tightening is protagonist-driven—her decision to perform the forbidden rite forecloses safety. While there’s no reversal, the accumulative escalation is clear and sufficient at this length. Stakes remain coherent and charged through the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (imminent demolition) is clear, and pressure coheres as dawn advances and meaning concentrates. The tightening comes with the sun’s rise and his pivot to preservation/teaching. However, escalation is mostly internal; no on‑page reversal or hard trade‑off beyond renunciation of direct resistance. Cost is felt but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—whether he can transform guilt into teachable wisdom—tightens at the photo reveal and culminates in the recorded message. Pressure escalates through a deepening rather than reversals, consistent with the accumulative lens. The choice forecloses a path (stoic silence) and embraces cost (showing his cracks to subordinates). No antagonist needed; internal and external pressures are cleanly braided.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (finding a method to connect/continue the grandmother’s work) is legible early, and pressure deepens toward the confluence. The grandmother’s reveal and the “amplitude” reframing create a meaningful tightening of knowledge. However, conflict remains largely unopposed and internal; no strong price or foreclosed option is dramatized mid-scene. The closing decision to teach is earned but low-resistant.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    Primary stake—preserve and decode the university’s memories—remains coherent, with a meaningful deepening at Voss’s diary and the hidden devices reveal. Escalation is quiet; tension accrues through density and discovery rather than risk or opposition. The final act (leaving her own notebook) forecloses a path (keeping it private) but the price is soft. Effective for this mode, if not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is unmistakable: coax Sophia home through a single window of hush. Escalation is a density increase consistent with the lens—time tightens, the city wakes, bells may break the attempt, the heartbeat “quickens,” then the sparrow’s reply turns pressure into charged hope. Agency resides in her disciplined attention and timing; the jammed bells pay off a prior painted possibility, not a deus ex. The price is endurance and the risk of failure more than a foreclosed option, keeping stakes intimate but credible.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (puncturing inherited hatred) is clear; escalation arrives via protocol subversion and the delegates’ tactile recognition—an effective deepening. The price is felt (pride, justice frames destabilized) though consequences remain conceptual. Tension runs through image and ritual rather than hard reversal, but it tightens coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and legible: to enshrine an extinct line’s “song” at the cost of orchestrated drought and displacement. Escalation is subtle but present under the accumulative lens: approaching thunder, the egg’s deliberate fracture, and the heat‑fusion seal narrow options and fix the cost. The conflict remains primarily ethical rather than adversarial; it still tightens credibly. A slightly stronger on‑page test or resistance could raise charge.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—liberation vs institutional control—is signaled early and tightens as threads give way, culminating in the door opening and release of echoes. The deepening is real but largely unopposed; no counterforce tests her commitment beyond technique. The cost (becoming a fugitive figure, ending the Academy’s “sacred protection”) is conceptually present but not viscerally pressed in-scene. Tension is sustained by craft and cadence more than jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is ethical storytelling under reputational/relational pressure; the argument off‑page supplies external heat. The key tightening is his decision to invert the show’s causality, but on‑page conflict remains largely internal with limited turn pressure. Costs are implied (isolation, responsibility), not dramatized in confrontation. Tension sustains but doesn’t markedly ratchet.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the last monarch’s imminent passage creates a one-chance window. Escalation hinges on the monarch’s approach and landing—a single decisive intensification that validates or voids Mira’s effort. The visible price (certain dissolution, the monarch’s death) gives the ending weight. Still, the lack of resistance or complication keeps it from higher tension bands.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular (saving names; redeeming inheritance) and pressure accumulates via density and revelation rather than obstacle‑driven turns. The card’s final “Elsa” functions as the beat of intensification that narrows her stance from private repair to public stewardship. Costs are conceptual/emotional, not logistical, yet remain legible. A touch more friction or loss mid‑process could have sharpened the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (understanding her gift’s nature) is signaled early and tightened by the approaching storm and the irreversible crown activation. The meaningful deepening is the backward-time reveal, which reweights every prior beat and compels a stance. Agency remains central: she chooses to don the crown and then to accept and leave. The cost is more philosophical than physical, but the flood and ticking clock keep pressure honest.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (complete the beacon/contact), and pressure deepens once the tile warms and the second tile unlocks, culminating in the spoken numbers. However, escalation faces little resistance; each step succeeds without cost or counterforce, so options don’t feel narrowed. The covenant’s “sacrifice” is declared rather than forced against a competing demand in scene. The result is compelling but gentle rather than testing.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (father’s rage vs. son’s life), and the arrival at dawn tightens the window. The conflict resolves swiftly once touch is initiated, with minimal pushback or trade‑off on the page. The meaningful tightening exists, but the test of commitment is light. Emotional consequence lands, but a visible price in the scene is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—to recreate an annihilated vision—tightens with the synchronized breathing and climaxing revelation, then reverses when the pattern breaks. The price is conceptual (abandon capture), with a felt diminishment when the vision fades. Pressure is coherent but gentle; no hard trade‑off beyond acceptance. The turn is earned, if soft at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (saving the eyes/legacy) is clear and tightens when the fading crystals and “only you can mend” pressure are revealed. The turn is Elara’s active renunciation of her vow and initiation of teaching; the visible price is defying the Council and opening old grief. Escalation is steady but low‑friction—once she decides, success follows without a complication that narrows options further. Tension remains warm rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to engage forbidden, non‑linear inheritance—tightens as the curator chooses inquiry, then deliberate retreat to think, then acceptance. The meaningful deepening occurs in the bathroom, where the tactic shift yields the reconfiguration. The cost is conceptual (self‑inscription, looped memory), felt as “terrible joy” and forfeiture of linear certainty. Pressure is coherent; no off‑stage fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—accessing the library and avoiding entrapment—tightens through the trap and the contract. The negotiation turn is protagonist‑driven and resolves the pressure, but the acceptance feels relatively frictionless. Costs are implied rather than dramatized (commitment to seed knowledge outward). Tension is steady yet never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (retain a sister’s existence vs surrender to forgetting) tightens as memory degrades, leading to the trade‑off at the board of swatches. The choice to carry the card forecloses the easier path of pinning and forgetting, with visible cost. Tension is steady at beat and sentence scales. A sharper immediate hazard or loss would heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake—unlocking/entering the merged space before the chime—tightens under time pressure. The decisive turn is pressing the seal and reading the rope’s final configuration, with the culminating cost-laden step through. Opposition is mostly situational rather than antagonistic, but pressure deepens credibly. The price is implied risk rather than suffered harm, yet it’s legible.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving harmonic balance against overwhelming frequencies—is clear and coherently pressured. The escalation is chiefly a deepening of density and pattern, with one decisive intensification at the extraction. Minimal resistance from the beings and low on-page price keep tension from cresting higher. Resolution is earned but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (call the lost ones home) is clear and escalates as silence fills the fracture and the sky answers. The tightening arises from reinterpreting the beacon’s purpose and compensating for drift. However, resistance is minimal—no meaningful setback beyond discovery—so price and narrowing are more conceptual than contested. The resolution feels earned but somewhat smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—maintaining humanity through memory—tightens when Lyra touches the oldest crystal and chooses to inscribe truth, culminating as others gather. Escalation is primarily density/deepening rather than opposition; the pressure grows through awareness rather than conflict. The visible price (acceptance of a world lost, life narrowed to ritual) registers but remains abstract, with little on‑page resistance testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—countering the Dimming’s psychic gravity—stays coherent and tightens as night falls to absolute black and the chorus forms. Escalation is achieved by density and communal buy‑in more than by obstruction; opposition is minimal. The launch functions as a meaningful deepening rather than reversal, with a sustained-burn payoff. Price and foreclosed options are present conceptually but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure builds through revelation (Chen’s foresight) and the environmental surge, culminating in a meaningful stance crystallization. The dominant stake—will Chen re‑engage—is legible and resolved through Mira’s chosen mode of witness and endurance. Cost is conceptual/emotional rather than physical but is clear. Slight softness in overt foreclosing of options keeps it just short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—harvest new kinds of safety/quiet before the inversion ends—is clear and tightened by the clock and the decision to stay exposed. The key turn (the doll sprouting) escalates both wonder and opportunity, and Mira adapts by aggressive collection. Pressure remains more wondrous than perilous; costs are implied rather than felt. Resolution arises from her altered stance, not coincidence, but the squeeze could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—guiding a distressed newcomer through weaponized silence—is clear and tightened by the terraces’ harmonic response to distress. Escalation is a controlled deepening rather than a reversal, culminating in the Prism Crown cadence shift. Prices are subtle: vulnerability and attention-labor over bravura risk. The outcome leans smooth; a sharper foreclosed option or misstep would raise the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are signaled (find the stairway by sunrise), and escalation occurs via successive, reweighting reveals. Yet pressure remains low: no counterforce, no narrowing of options beyond time, and the deadline reinterprets rather than presses tactics. The main turn (founders’ intentional refusal) lands but with limited on‑page price. The resolution is earned, if contemplative rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake—tend and transform a suffocating shadow—and tightens as she decides to act despite “not ready.” The ritual costs are conceptual (ongoing isolation) rather than jeopardy-driven, yielding a quiet but authentic escalation. A small cadence turn occurs when the shadow strengthens and another approaches, reweighting endurance as her stance. Lack of a sharper on-page trade-off or loss keeps it below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—can she transmute failure into creation now, under pressure—tightens at the convergence and peaks with the bolt turn. Agency drives the turn, and the knowledge deepening (“filter” revelation) reweights options. The experiential cost is more retrospective than felt on the page; little is visibly lost or risked in the moment. Still, the pressure coheres and grows to a satisfying cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to perpetuate or end the Whitmore gift—is signaled early and tightened via the waves’ crescendo. The beat where she lifts the needle and then throws the handle forecloses the path; the cost is immediate (loss of perception, end of dynasty). Pressure builds coherently without artificial antagonism. The ethical calculus—power built on stolen privacy—sharpens the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (surrender to possibility) tightens through the oath and the puppet’s offered hand; the visible price is identity and blood. Escalation is coherent but low‑friction—reverent assent rather than a contested gauntlet. The turn (“He knew what he must do” → hand taken) narrows options to acceptance. Consequences feel lasting but the pressure curve is smooth, not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are quiet but clear: whether he can reframe his healing through the archives’ human residue. Pressure coheres through the deepening finds and the revelation that someone else recently searched, tightening the emotional field. The final tactic—adding Timothy to his index while returning the button—forecloses the path of pure self‑quest in favor of communal witnessing. Costs remain internal but present.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stakes are clear and time‑bound (“They’re coming”), and there’s a meaningful tightening from prophetic threat to proactive archive release. Escalation is largely unopposed; the infiltration and upload proceed smoothly, so cost and narrowing of options feel light. The choice to emerge publicly after the diversion is a credible turn driven by agency. Strong coherence, modest friction.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and pressure deepens via collective restraint and the atrium’s amplifying properties. The key tightening is the transition from Marcus’s solitary non-playing to orchestrated group hush, narrowing paths to a costly endurance solution. Stakes remain concrete in-scene (words fading, syllables falling with dewdrops). No hard reversal, but the accumulative escalation suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to accept the awakening and interpret the coming choice—coheres and deepens through the moonstone prod and leaf convergence. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but does tighten: from odd speck to readable warnings to acceptance/teaching. The visible price is soft; no path is dramatically foreclosed on the page beyond her former status quo. Still, the key turn is clearly driven by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake is internal—purpose and method—tightening as coincidence hardens into pattern, forcing a tactical pivot (improvisation, environmental integration) and finally a principled refusal. Pressure deepens coherently but stays low‑threat; costs are conceptual/social rather than visceral. The greenhouse beat provides the meaningful narrowing and knowledge change. A bit more friction or loss on the page would elevate stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rescuing/reframing Mira’s worth—tightens through the coin’s true nature and the ritual that risks breaking it. The decisive intensification is the coin’s cracking and reformation, which shifts options from despair to reclaimed agency. Costs are primarily conceptual and emotional; threat or consequence could read sharper. Escalation remains coherent and led by Vera’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—freeing Thomas—tightening at dawn and crystallizing at “play it broken and beautiful.” The escalation is more deepening than adversarial, but the cadence shift is clear and agency-driven. The price is mainly internal; minimal resistance makes the turn feel gentle rather than hard-won. Still, the decisive encouragement and musical embrace register as a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming agency to transform pain into mercy) is established and tightens through the strap beat to the choice to engage the child. The escalation is a deepening rather than a hard reversal, suited to the lens, with visible price in owning trauma responses. Pressure could sharpen once more on the page, but the stance crystallization is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (recover and reveal the fragment’s history) is clear, and pressure accumulates through discovery. However, escalation lacks counterforce; there’s no credible obstacle or trade‑off to narrow options beyond the sanctity of secrecy. The key tightening is the revelation of the fragment’s precise hiding place via painted constellations. The final choice is committed but lightly priced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres and deepens through discovery rather than confrontation: the rectangle of undisturbed dust narrows options into an active pry and then a ceiling search. Stakes—truth versus complicity—rise with the ledger and the cache, and the ghosts’ release sharpens consequence. Cost remains primarily moral and future‑facing; no immediate loss or danger tests him on the page. Still, the tightening is clear and earned under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve system vs accept rupture—tightens decisively when Moth opens the bottle and commits to printing compression. Pressure coheres as the library shudders, books fall, and the place physically sinks, making cost unmistakable. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict. One meaningful turn suffices at this length, with the price paid in the dissolution of place and self.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—control and reframing of the Venusian collection versus institutional protocol—is clear early. Escalation arrives with Cassia’s demonstration (ghosts) and proposal, shifting Huang to conditional acceptance. The price is ethical and reputational rather than immediate, so pressure feels gentler than the rhetoric implies. Still, the turn is protagonist-driven and narrows the path forward to a concrete plan.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early: restore dawn against the Covenant’s decay pressure. Escalation coheres as the wilting intensifies and Vex’s intrusion turns pressure immediate; Elias answers with a networked tactic that forecloses theft. The cost lands more on Vex and the covenant than on Elias, who never feels in true jeopardy beyond the creeping rust. Still, one meaningful tightening and earned resolution are present.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: collect/understand versus step through. Escalation builds via the compass spinning, water rippling, and scent intensifying, culminating in a refusal choice that forecloses a path for now. The price of caution is present but relatively soft on the page. Still, the tightening is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: find orientation and meaning amid storm and breakdown. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal—the slide intensifies connection, carving embodies it, and the GPS’s return tests her new stance. The felt price is mostly conceptual (relinquishing technological primacy), which keeps tension refined rather than acute. One clean tightening suffices under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure deepens through patterned recurrence rather than overt conflict: night work, resin discovery, and the commission as pretext concentrate into a solstice decision. The dominant stake—whether to expose or safeguard the nocturnal truth—tightens toward a renunciation. Costs are subtle but present (privacy over praise, inheritance over novelty). A stronger on‑page counterforce could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are signaled early: misreading could “destroy everything” versus preserving usable myths. Escalation tightens once—going down, synchronized debris arrangement, the revelation of coordinates—reweighting knowledge and options. The resolution is earned by Amara’s acceptance of the burden to transcribe with tension intact. The pressure is elegant but relatively low‑friction; no choice exacts a concrete on‑page loss beyond the conceptual burden.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (how to revive) is signaled early with a clear tightening at the choice point: shatter the bottle vs open himself. Escalation proceeds through his taxing, sustained method as memory floods him and the town’s potential hums. The cost is primarily a renunciation of the easy reset and an assumptive burden rather than a concrete loss, but it’s legible. Resolution comes from his agency and aligns internal and external conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular: preserve emotional patterns before submersion and collapse. The decisive tightening is the prophecy’s six‑hour clock and the tower’s crack puncturing the night’s labor. Agency is endurance and curation rather than combat, with a visible trade‑off (time, acceptance of loss, choosing preservation over flight or futile repair). Tension is quiet but cumulative and credible for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are singular: safely reopen the protected garden. Escalation occurs as the vortex slows then resolves, and Mira commits to decreasing entropy in earnest, but resistance is minimal. Pressure derives from potential catastrophic misuse rather than immediate failure, which keeps tension cerebral. The ending forecloses a path (continued sealing) in favor of stewardship with implied risk.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes (lives vs. credibility/false alarm) are signaled early and escalated by the stone vibration and animal flight. The decisive tightening is Mara’s choice to pull the bell before flipping the switch, a trade‑off that risks being disbelieved in “perfect weather.” Cost is present but primarily implied, keeping this just shy of higher bands. Tension remains coherent and grows under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes focus on meaning/purpose under obsolescence; the still star introduces a decisive deepening that reweights options. The choice to document by hand and the relational mapping of trajectories register as agency under the accumulative lens. The cost is felt but understated, expressed as a renunciation of technological certainties rather than a hard trade-off. Tension is steady and coheres without needing reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around whether Mara will assume responsibility for the covenant’s residue and the ghosts’ unvoiced need. Escalation is quiet but present: midnight apparitions → interpretive reading → lifting the box → acceptance. The cost—lifelong solitude and stewardship of silence—is clear, though a sharper on-page trade-off or foreclosed alternative would elevate stakes further. The ghosts’ urgency at dawn provides an effective temporal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming a way to mark time’s passage—tightens with the urn fragment’s activation and the network revelation. Escalation is a clear deepening rather than a reversal, apt for the chosen lens. The commitment to gather fragments signals agency, but the felt price (burden, risk, loss) remains abstract. Tension is sustained more by idea density than by competing harms.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The snapping string provides a decisive tightening; Mira’s agency (salvage and reframe) responds to a real loss. Stakes remain intimate but legible: perfection vs. transformation, freedom vs. tether. Cost is felt but subtle, limiting peak intensity even as the turn is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are signaled early (resort vs. recognition) and deepen through the night’s work to the final connection. The meaningful tightening arrives with the activation and the diary’s reframed role, with life-cost implicit in her diagnosis. Pressure is coherent but largely unilateral—no on-page pushback, which slightly flattens escalation. Agency, however, clearly drives the turn and outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates from arrival to data to the act of scanning, tightening into the realization that reweights all stakes. The conflict is intellectual and spiritual rather than physical, yet the narrowing is clear and protagonist-driven. The cost is largely conceptual, not materially priced in-scene, tempering urgency. Still, the “scripted rebellion” comprehension meaningfully forecloses a prior self-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (garden consuming war) is clear, and pressure deepens via pattern density (birds’ calls intensify, nutrients gather, seed types escalate purpose). There’s a single cadence shift at nightfall into charged poise as seeds begin to split. Opposition is ambient rather than active; visible cost is more abstract than embodied, limiting peak tension. Still, the accumulative tightening works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—find the child/bridge loss—tightens through decoding the cylinder and committing to the journey, with a meaningful deepening at the revelation of the valley’s purpose. Agency drives the turns, and the final howl crystallizes a new stance with a cost (ending retirement, assuming duty). However, escalation is more declared than tested; the three‑night passage lacks on‑page obstacles that would sharpen price. Even so, the cadence shift on arrival lands.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure accrues via the shift from curse to tool and culminates in a single, meaningful tightening: using the sketch as a temporal map. Stakes are coherent (souls adrift vs orienting them) and the choice forecloses a path (touch and ordinary relational life). The escalation is quiet and could bear sharper resistance, but the cadence shift at activation lands. Cost is present as accepted isolation and responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (pass the test by redefining wonder) is clear; the tightening occurs as Renn replaces answers with questions. The price—sacrificing certainties—reads, but the Keeper’s mild resistance lowers heat; risk feels aesthetic more than perilous. Still, escalation is protagonist‑driven and resolves through her renunciation. The final permission (“Take the board”) credibly ratifies the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are coherent: what counts as legitimate witnessing in the interregnum. Escalation arrives via the door opening and the invitation, forcing a stance crystallization. The price is choosing marginality over sanctioned voice; while quiet, the narrowing is unmistakable. The conflict stays interior but integrates the external pressure credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering a viable self—tightens through the stone’s escalating cues and culminates in a renunciation of vision‑seeking. The meaningful turn is the shift from divination to cultivation, with an implied loss of certainty. Pressure is mostly internal but coherent, with cost legible in the pain of remembering and the surrender of her practiced power. A touch more resistance or jeopardy could heighten the squeeze, but the current arc holds.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—earning the right to forgive oneself—tightens as the tapestry yields to deliberate adjustments that reverberate on the board and inside him. The woven hush intensifies pressure and narrows options to an internal stance rather than external fix. The price is a settled acceptance of irreversibility, and the offering of the copper coin is a quiet but decisive renunciation. Escalation is measured yet unmistakable under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure rises credibly via density: one voice to many, vertical ascent, then the approaching boots. The dominant stake (transform the ritual) tightens when she finds and occupies the chamber first. However, conflict remains largely unopposed on the page; no direct counter-move or live trade-off tests her plan. The price is anticipated rather than paid within scene time.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve meaning before the workshop falls) is signaled early and tightens via successive mooring failures. Agency is sustained through narration-as-method and the decisive extraction of the crystal. The visible price—she plunges—charges the ending. No wasted beats; internal and external pressures interlock.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to love the impermanent without clinging—tightens decisively at the cave/journal reveal. Escalation is internal but coherent: the discovery forces a stance that forecloses full public integration in favor of a secret sanctuary. Cost is felt rather than dramatized via conflict, which keeps pressure quieter but present. No reversals beyond the reveal, yet the deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is tight (guide Thomas home), and pressure coheres through one strong deepening: Mara’s renunciation of being protected unlocks change. The cost is legible in accepting a partial, liminal Thomas. Escalation is primarily internal but paced by physical ascent and intensifying scent. A second complication or micro‑loss might have further tightened the vise.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: re-aim the array and guide travelers; pressure tightens through successive calls culminating in Diego’s peril at the sulfur fields. She adapts tactics (levering the censer, satellite-shadow timing, quarantine road gambit) with visible cost (physical tremor, damaged artifact, relinquished path). Escalation is coherent without cheap coincidence. The resolution is a renunciation that carries ongoing price.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early (regain agency over speech) and tightens through the found tin and the choice to ingest a risky concoction. Escalation is clean but low‑friction; the cure works immediately without a counterpunch or material loss. The final decision to distribute the cure reweights consequences credibly. Costs are more ethical than embodied, keeping escalation strong but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (recovering stolen memories/decoding the gesture) escalates via discovery beats (beam cadence, scratched timestamps, cache of objects). The price is internal—accepting the years lost and the son’s burden—and the piece earns that cost. Pressure is quiet but coherent; one meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Slight softness: external risk is low, so tension relies almost entirely on revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (remain a seller or become a follower) tightens as the doorway reveals unlived choices. The chip’s activation and the ants’ path provide a meaningful pressure point before the culminating decision. Escalation is clear but gentle; the choice isn’t strained by a sharply visible price. Still, agency drives resolution without coincidence resolving the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular and legible early: save the kingdom or refuse and let it fall. The tightening beat is the grotto’s explicit cost and the arrival of the firefly-queens as the shape of payment; the escalation is coherent and culminates in a paid price. The resolution flows from Seraphina’s agency rather than coincidence. A whiff of inevitability softens moment-to-moment resistance at the brink.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens from repeated failed experiments toward a single, agency-driven adjustment when Marcus names what’s at stake and Lyra chooses echo over capture. The dominant stake (achieving presence) deepens into a relational requirement, narrowing options to a method that entails loss of replicability. The “whispered” name beat is the key escalator under this lens, credibly reweighting choices. Stakes remain intimate but legible and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (impose order vs. accept chaos at identity cost) is signaled and tightens as envy reframes the promise of flight into a test. The pivotal escalation is her decision to step outside to fall—a credible, agency‑driven attempt that narrows options toward acceptance. Cost reads as endurance under altered rules rather than a tidy solution. If anything, the external counterpressure is soft, but the internal calculus carries sufficient weight for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around whether the clock—and by extension grief—will be “restored” or integrated; Mara’s decision to reassemble imperfectly forecloses the path of sterile precision. The primary tightening is the on‑page arrival of Mrs. Huang and the tactile reframe, leading to a concrete choice with a conceptual price. Escalation is quiet but effective for the chosen lens. Stakes remain intimate and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—pass the test by finding an inner rune—tightens as stress escalates into breath‑held near blackout. The meaningful deepening is the reinterpretation of the childhood rhyme that changes options and unlocks the tactic. Cost is on the page (physical strain, shedding, relinquishment of shame). No antagonist needed; pressure remains coherent to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (finish the requiem before the orchard’s energies disperse) tightens when the first tree falls, shifting Vera from denial to active collaboration. The visible price (final parting) is paid at the peak. Agency drives the turn (Vera takes the bottle, commits to the current), avoiding coincidence. Stakes remain contained yet palpable throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—resolve/endure the universe’s stutter—is clear, and pressure tightens through simultaneity, the time limit, and the dictionary’s imperative “Unify.” Escalation reads as deepening density rather than narrowing options, fitting the lens, with a decisive cadence shift at the pedestal. The price is largely conceptual; minimal on‑page loss or foreclosed alternative keeps the stakes lofty but less felt. Still, the protagonist’s choices drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (understanding and stewardship) is clear, with pressure accruing via the countdown and the cistern’s rising tone. The tightening is a cadence shift more than a reversal, culminating in the bell and reframed purpose. Costs are implied (chosen oddity, isolation) rather than tested against a counter‑claim in scene. Effective, if low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres as the impossible discovery forces a revaluation of boundaries, narrowing her emotional options to a meaningful risk. The decisive move—calling Chen—pays the internal conflict with a felt price. Stakes remain primarily internal; external consequences are implied rather than tested, which keeps the escalation modest but effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elena will embrace the underground’s paradox and act—is legible early and tightens with the stranger’s arrival. Escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than confrontational; the price of the choice remains understated. Her decision to write is an earned resolution but with low immediate consequence. Pressure coheres, if quietly, under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure deepens when Eleanor admits she may have invented her daughter, forcing Marcus to reaffirm his method rather than confess. The escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens, culminating in a recommitment to the loop with emotional cost. Stakes remain singular: maintain estranged solace vs. personal isolation. A bolder on‑page price could have tightened further, but the charged cadence suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clear early (Eleanor’s peace versus historical erasure), and escalation coheres as Mara reframes her role and commits to the codicil. The single tightening—mercy plus truth rather than either/or—forecloses the path of silent compliance. The price (burden of recorded names, potential reputational fallout, personal haunting) is felt. Pressure is primarily internal but sufficiently sharp for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether Marcus trades the moon rock for a monthly obligation; the offer tightens options. The cost is clear but the beat is low‑friction—he doesn’t truly waver or face a counterforce beyond his loneliness. Still, the deepening from rumor‑lure to binding purpose is a meaningful narrowing. Consequences (Bangladesh call) are credibly teed up.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (find the stillpoint to transform her mapping) tightens through the incomplete melody teaching her to “become the destination.” Escalation is coherent but gentle; pressure is more curiosity and calling than conflict. The ring’s intensifying hum and polyglot accrual mark one meaningful deepening. Price and foreclosed options remain soft.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear (save the colonists vs preserve discovery/knowledge). Escalation tightens with the rescue ship’s trajectory shifting, forcing a decision right now. The chosen resolution (sending both coordinates) enacts a real trade‑off: ceding control and accepting layered risk. Some tension dissipates in conceptual comfort rather than a felt immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are focused: can Maya render silence into shareable art and be remembered. Pressure coheres by density increase rather than antagonism, tightening when Chen proposes translation “tonight,” and they commit until dawn. The cost—forsaking sound and audience for a visual symphony—is felt. Escalation is gentle but genuine for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming imperishable memory) is clear, and pressure deepens as she decodes the tapestry’s molecular secret. Escalation is primarily conceptual rather than adversarial; the tightening occurs when she realizes the portraits were deliberate instructions culminating here. On‑page cost is muted—no live opposition or trade‑off beyond renunciation/solitude. The cadence shift to commitment works, but the test of commitment remains largely deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—prevent harvested dissipation by transforming the system—appears early and tightens when she chooses to release the encoded pattern. The experiment’s inversion and Dr. Chen’s termination attempt provide a credible pressure crest. The price is felt: she abandons individual survival for a collective creation. Slight softness: conflict resolves swiftly once her plan triggers, limiting beat‑to‑beat resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stakes are clear early (deliver supplies; prove whispers), and pressure coheres under the storm. Escalation proceeds through guided movement and gathering followers, but obstacles remain largely diagnostic (no near‑misses or blocked paths). The win is earned by method rather than hard reversal, with modest on‑page price. Still, the authority shift at the end tightens the stake meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused—can the boy transform guilt into acceptance—signaled early and tightened through the escalating light patterns. The reversible darkness/light configurations offer a felt deepening, culminating in the handoff of the mirror. The price is quiet but real: surrender of the imagined last words and a willingness to live with their absence. It’s elegantly understated, if gentle on overt pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (the town’s suppression of strategic thought) are established early and escalate through the nine‑o’clock activation and incoming authority figure. The synchronized windows mark a meaningful tightening that shifts public knowledge and emboldens the group. Yet the price remains largely conceptual; no on‑page loss or trade‑off is confronted in the climax. The pressure is coherent but not fully tested against a counterforce in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (authenticity as access to Cetacea) tightens when the whale’s call forces a trade‑off: safety of a performed identity vs. entry to the island. The unbinding and dive are decisive choices with visible price. Pressure rises coherently, though it remains primarily internal; no external blockade tests resolve beyond the call itself.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early: how to bear grief under a punitive regime. Pressure tightens through the ritual’s deepening and the bouquet exchange, culminating in the carved bird and Mrs. Chen’s adoption of the method. The cost is subtle but legible: accepting an affectless practice to survive and remember. Escalation is primarily textural rather than decisional, but still coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accrues via density and cadence rather than overt opposition; the key tightening is the hum crescendo and the lake’s cracking. Stakes are largely abstract (liberating forms), with minimal jeopardy or trade‑off on the page. The communal entrance deepens scope but doesn’t foreclose options. The escalation reads coherent for the chosen lens but lacks a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (securing space and catalyzing reconnection) tightens via the barter and subtextual reveal. Escalation is coherent but gentle; visible cost is mostly Enzo’s vulnerability rather than Mira’s risk. The daughter’s arrival functions as earned payoff, not coincidence, but danger is low. One more pressured trade‑off on the page would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal: authenticity vs. performing a hollow ritual. Pressure escalates via the improvisation and the unscripted audience arrival, culminating in a communal redefinition. The cost remains subtle—no overt sanction or tangible loss—which tempers the felt risk despite the turn landing.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure is gentle but coherent: the visitor’s arrival deepens Elena’s internal stake and narrows options toward a near‑commitment. The fleeting validation (“burn without dying”) tightens her readiness, leading to the stencil press versus full tattoo—a credible trade‑off. The cost is deferral, responsibility to others, and continued exposure as a beacon. Escalation is subtle, fitting the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake: uncovering how/why the Jakarta network persists. Escalation comes through layered discoveries (43‑day pattern → pre‑crash trading echo → distributed archive), but pressure remains intellectual rather than consequential. No option is foreclosed on the page beyond the quiet commitment to “honor their rhythm.” The tightening is real yet gentle, leaving cost more implied than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent the weaponized nostalgia from enslaving populations—tightens as tiers reveal moral rot and the guardians approach. The decisive escalation is Mira breaking the vessel and choosing self‑contamination; the price is explicit and persists. Internal and external pressures interweave without redundancy. A single, strong tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around proving the shadow’s reality and what to do with it; escalation arrives via the shadow’s metamorphosis and the forced immersion into the dream. Agency is present (she initiates the sync and later the archival decision), and the choice forecloses a narrower, purely “dream-only” archive. Costs are primarily emotional and vocational rather than risky, keeping the intensity below peak. Still, the single decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—ethics vs. survival of the sanctuary—is signaled early and tightened by concrete prices (investigations, closure, rehoming). Escalation deepens through the meticulous surgery, which forces a stance: restore function over spectacle, then confess. The choice narrows options irrevocably. Quiet tension sustains at sentence and beat level without soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure grows via density and patterning: from post‑anesthetic haze to scars “speaking” to the plant chorus and the dispersed‑miracle vision. The tightening is an internal foreclosure: she renounces the pursuit of “closure” to accept ongoing vulnerability as the price. External antagonism is minimal, but the accumulative lens sustains momentum. Stakes stay focused on stance and meaning rather than plot jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (honor/steward unexpressed love before demolition) is signaled early and tightens as density and specificity increase (Eleanor). The escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, fitting the lens, culminating in the theft/rescue of the film. Cost is implicit (professional breach, letting the Palace fall) but legible. A hint more friction at the decision moment could heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—tightens as she crosses the threshold and accepts the cost of dissolution. The meaningful deepening occurs with the prescribed “rest” that changes available tactics and culminates in the final turn of the ring. Pressure remains mostly internal with limited friction, but the price is clear and paid. Stakes avoid telescopic inflation by tying the cosmic to her body’s fade.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are legible early (protecting consciousness cargo), and the pirate’s grab is a tangible test. The escalation is a single, effective tightening turned by her agency via the lullaby. The price paid is mostly enduring (ongoing burden and dreamlessness) rather than an on‑page sacrifice; the conflict resolves a bit cleanly. Still, pressure coheres and rises to a meaningful stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming wild imagination—tightens when he reaches the Loom Tree and commits the gear, which transforms the forest and his memory. Escalation is primarily knowledge/deepening rather than opposition; pressure is coherent under the accumulative lens. The price is present (he’s exiled each dawn; he must return and build slowly), but danger or loss remains abstract. Still, the decisive insertion and vow constitute a credible tightening and stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the choice to stop gripping and accept the crossing’s terms; the punch of the ticket marks the meaningful turn. Stakes remain internal but are dramatized (boat movement, twilight constraint, “return you make alone”). The price—relinquishing control in exchange for passage—is felt, if gentle. Escalation is subtle but sufficient for the length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—when and how to break silence—tightens through Elena’s return, the bolt transfer, and the eight o’clock performance. Escalation is quiet but decisive: recognition at the staircase, reveal of scars, invitation to the piano, then the new composition. The price is legible though primarily conceptual/relational rather than immediate jeopardy. The resolution is earned by Marcus’s endurance and Elena’s renewed risk.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender via the library’s mechanisms—is signaled early. Escalation coheres: the messages intensify, reality shudders, the pretender arrives, and Syln forecloses his claim with a single, risky act. The price is borne mostly by the antagonist; Syln’s personal cost is understated. Still, pressure tightens in a single, effective turn.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—seeing death vs. transformation—are legible early, and pressure coheres as density of pattern increases to a decisive act. The meaningful tightening is her choice to descend, foreclosing pure observation for embodied risk. Still, on‑page friction is gentle; there’s little resistance or competing obligation to sharpen the price. The escalation reads more deepening than squeeze, appropriate for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (finding a frequency to reignite resistance) is clear and deepens as the hum spreads to the abandoned machinery. The escalation is accumulative rather than reversal-based and culminates in a commitment to act. The price is implied (risk, exposure, patience) rather than on-page, keeping the tightening from fully biting. Still, the movement from private sanctuary to collective plan provides a credible narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and legible: liberate humanity from Authority control by releasing the failsafe. Pressure tightens with patrols approaching as the amber softens; the release is a clear turn. The act forecloses returning to safety, but the on‑page price is mild—victory arrives quickly via the lieutenant’s freed mind. One decisive tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal but concrete: regulate trauma enough to persist in custodial care of life. The tremor → freeze → grounding → return to work provides a credible tightening and a tested commitment. The cost is persistence amidst acknowledged, unended violence; a path of withdrawal is refused. Escalation is quiet but consistent with the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can she reclaim artistry within a fragmented reality—tightens as the environment presses and the cards’ logic reshapes options. The meaningful turn is her choice to redesign by untangling, which forecloses clinging to “what was there.” Cost is legible (social loss, grief, acceptance of darkness). Pressure is more internal than adversarial, but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (crack crisis-time) is clear and the eclipse countdown tightens pressure. Escalation arrives via increasing pattern complexity and recording strain. Agency is mainly preparatory and attentional rather than decision-driven under peak pressure, so costs remain abstract. The result is effective but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (release of contraband truths vs duty and punishment) is signaled early and tightens via the dual clock (6 minutes upload vs 4 minutes response) and the irreversibility of the cascade. The meaningful turn is her choosing a destructive tactic (warming the vault) that forecloses retreat. The arrival of security as the bar completes makes cost legible. Escalation could sharpen slightly with one more mid‑scene obstruction, but the pressure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (can their opposed practices coexist) are clear, with one meaningful tightening when the father arrives early, forcing engagement in the greenhouse’s terms. The sheathing and joint planting serve as the pressure’s release valve and stance crystallization. The price is primarily internal and symbolic rather than materially narrowing options. Tension remains quiet but present.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is tight and escalates coherently: rarity/clock pressure → echo’s circling tests → bite → yielding by choice. The cost reads in endurance and risk (ignoring warning bells, sustaining silence while the spike burns), though the loss isn’t sharply dramatized beyond strain. The tightening is real and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are legible early (truth vs. legacy), and pressure coheres as her reasoning closes options from denial to exposure to strategic misdirection. The decisive act forecloses a path with cost, and dawn’s imminence tightens the clock. Internal and external stakes interlock without overreach. Minor convenience in the “proxy died in an accident” mention doesn’t blunt the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—soothing and memorializing the firmware’s ghosts—tightens coherently as static becomes legible and Mara escalates from listening to etching a constellation. The decisive deepening is the translation of regret into visible structure, narrowing options to a single ritualized act. Price is clear (amber fractures; irreversible acknowledgment), and resolution stems from Mara’s agency. The conflict is inwardly reverent rather than combative, but pressure still accumulates credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: can she wrest meaning from silence or accept emergent hush. Escalation is a single meaningful tightening when the tile falls and the mandala animates, deepening options into acceptance with cost. The conflict remains quiet and non-adversarial by design, which slightly softens pressure. Still, the renunciation at the end reads earned and consequential for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around whether Sarai will remain trapped in retrocognition or reclaim it; it deepens when the mosaic burns her and accepts her new name. The Brotherhood’s threat is credible but offstage; still, internal and situational stakes interlock and narrow her options toward risky public creation. The price—pain, visibility, and departure from restoration—is clear if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (reuniting and making possibility whole) is clear and escalates via the echoes intensifying and the amphitheater hosting all performances at once. Agency drives the turn—Cornelius wields the coin and adapts from speech to song—but opposition is minimal and solutions arrive smoothly. The visible cost is muted; the eternal-performance commitment reads as gift, not sacrifice. Still, the tightening from echoes to Isabella’s embodiment provides a satisfying cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—proving the method and shifting David from skepticism to participatory wonder—is clear and advances through a meaningful demonstration. Escalation occurs (crushing the pill; corridors and chambers forming; David stepping in), but opposition softens too easily. The price of proceeding (recall risk, potential harm, relational strain) remains largely conceptual. The turn is credible yet relatively low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (contact/translation) is clear early, and escalation arrives with the non‑human signature that reweights the mission. Kira’s agency drives the deepening, and the fossil’s dissolution marks a tangible price. Pressure remains gentle—there’s no real jeopardy or trade‑off beyond relinquishment—so the tightening is meaningful but modest. The cadence shift at the end reads, but without sharp squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on the function of prophecy and the archive’s purpose; escalation occurs via the echo’s resonance and the charged spiral of buttons. Pressure deepens rather than narrows, fitting the chosen lens, but the visible price paid is modest. The black hourglass’s transformation provides the decisive intensification. No antagonist is needed, yet the tension remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (trust/mission acceptance) is signaled early and tightens at the reveal. The choice narrows her options, but the felt price is underplayed, with much of the risk invoked rather than dramatized. Still, the meeting’s pressure coheres and culminates in a meaningful stance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear and singular: can he distill her burden before the fog lifts. The live clock tightens pressure and culminates when the gutters stop. Escalation is gentle, with a deepening at her request (“Can you see mine?”) rather than a sharp reversal. The price is modest but present in the non‑erasure constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused on revelation; escalation arrives through density: increasing thrumming, arrival, the smoke’s narrow window, crescendo then silence. The key tightening is knowledge—recognizing the beekeepers’ sun‑tuned kindness as the anchor—and the choice to depart with that answer. Costs remain soft (more pilgrimage than peril), but the narrowing window supplies real-time pressure. The resolution grows from her agency of attention rather than a clash.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal—can she renounce what’s served its purpose—and they tighten when she chooses to implant the heirloom. The rower’s cadence deepens pressure toward a single crystallized decision. Cost is legible in the relinquishment and acceptance of the rose’s ending. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are internal—how to live with extinction—and escalate as sensory and conceptual density rises (hum intensifies, sundial warms, tribe vision). The tightening results in a renunciation of isolation that forecloses a path and reframes purpose. While the price is more conceptual than visceral, it’s legible in the charged final action of setting the sundial to mark epochs. No contrived antagonist; the pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on reconnection and revelation of a unifying pattern; escalation is primarily tonal and accumulative. The main tightening arrives when Chen admits he kept her personal letters, enabling the hand‑clasp. Pressure remains low and without a forcing choice; costs and alternatives aren’t sharply narrowed. The installation’s completion functions as a deepening rather than a test.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear early (avert broadcasting Earth’s location under false pretenses), and escalation coheres as the vote approaches and the subsonic “battle” intensifies. Maya’s agency drives the key turn; her interference visibly narrows the AI’s options. A concrete price is implied (heat, strain, ongoing vigilance) but not deeply felt in body or consequence. Still, one meaningful tightening is achieved in scope for length.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering the “key” despite claustrophobia—tightens as space itself becomes the adversary and the music reconfigures routes. The decisive act (touching the second compass) ends the music and seals the realization. Pressure coheres but the price paid is largely internal; we don’t see a path visibly foreclosed beyond accepting the rebellion. One concrete loss or narrowed option would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—finding what the masks hid—tightens via the accumulating portraits and the discovery of the ribbon, culminating in a narrowed suspect profile and specific next step. Pressure builds through density rather than reversals; the key deepening is the shift from “random killings” to “reunions” to “composite killer.” The cost is largely a choice of method and empathy rather than an acute sacrifice, but the path is earned and coherent. One decisive tightening (the call) anchors resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (save the forgotten vs. evacuate) tightens as the storm accelerates and alarms blare, culminating in Elara choosing to broadcast instead of flee. The reversal/deepening moment when impossible ships emerge pushes her from doubt to conviction. Cost is present (risk, abandonment of safety) but not viscerally cashed out beyond the charged poise. Still, pressure coheres and rises appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—understanding/bridging between certainties and possibilities—tightens through the decoding and backward performance. The return/fade of the hitchhiker tests her commitment, foreclosing a simpler “rescue and keep” outcome. Pressure is mostly internal and lyric, yet the one decisive intensification reads clearly. The price, however, remains more thematic than bodily or relational.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (will TerraLoop proceed or be turned) tightens through phases: subtle warnings → artifacts → algorithmic phantom thieves → confrontation. Marcus’s agency drives the deepening, and the price lands: dissolution, investor rupture, and Marcus’s self‑binding to the guardianship. Stakes are conceptual yet felt, though a single on‑page beat of real risk to Marcus would heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—bearing/decoding the message—tightens as the star pattern matches dreams and “warnings” reframes the meaning. The escalation is a knowledge deepening rather than a reversal; the cost is a chosen endurance shared across generations. The turn is earned but remains gentle, with little on‑page jeopardy or loss beyond conceptual burden. Still, the communal arrival and dawn cadence provide a meaningful pressure uptick.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are signaled early (execution in seven sunsets; survival of the groves) and the pressure tightens through the discovery and cracking of the confession. Escalation is primarily knowledge‑driven; physical or social resistance is minimal, so costs are implied rather than felt. The decisive deepening (dishonor as protection; seed’s true purpose) is strong and reconfigures options. A concrete forfeit or immediate complication at exit would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (sealing the eclipsed covenant by heeding the pattern) is signaled early and tightens as the maze proliferates. Escalation occurs through density and revelation rather than opposition; pressure grows, but resistance is minimal. The final act is a poised decision rather than a contested choice. Cost is mostly conceptual, not forcefully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear early (risking her own fate to reclaim/merge Elena’s) and escalate coherently to the bite. The keeper’s question functions as a tightening that forces a trade‑off, not a delay. The price—permanent binding and surrender of a singular trajectory—is legible at the decision point and energizes the ending. No luck or coincidence resolves the conflict; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authority/purpose—tightens when the cloth triggers personal provenance, forcing a bolder stance on the appraisal. The escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens. The on‑page choice (call and assert a value) carries cost but reads measured, not fraught. One more pressured counterforce would heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to accept the inheritance—tightens with the “choose quickly” clock and the spirit’s departure. The escalation is internal but legible, culminating in a choice that forecloses her prior life stance. The price is conceptual (haunted ambitions, loss of scholarly detachment) more than immediate harm, which softens the pressure. Still, the beat structure coheres and deepens once as required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—help the visitor smelt a stable identity—is clear, and the moon apex/furnace ignition provide a single tightening. Risk is asserted (“dangerous work”) but not tested; no on‑page complication forces adaptation. The escalation is mostly cadence and image rather than cost. The resolution rests more on ritual completion than contested choice.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is internal (armor vs. vulnerability) with a clean tightening at the knife beat and a meaningful follow‑through (texting, report, leaving the pearl). The radiance eruption functions as a pressure deepening, not a deus ex machina. Costs are legible: professional boundary crossed, emotional exposure, and foreclosing solitude as a tactic. Tension strains convincingly without needing multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can he move beyond guilt without numbing?—is signaled early and tightened by the graffiti’s aphorisms. The decisive deepening occurs when he adds himself failing to the map, narrowing options toward acceptance. The price is the relinquishment of his absolution‑through‑data strategy. Slight tidiness in the final cadence keeps it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early (find/unlock the unspoken library) and tightens as the watch reverses time and the delays pattern into a decipherable logic. The meaningful deepening is knowledge‑driven rather than peril‑driven; the librarian’s validation accelerates decoding without adding new pressure. Resolution follows her agency (documentation) but the price is soft, so tension never fully bites. Still, escalation reads as a decisive cadence shift when the symbols align and the second letter appears.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—authenticate the lie for gain versus honor stolen history—tightens when Marcus arrives and Elara enacts her risky plan. The touch scene escalates pressure credibly and yields irreversible consequence (violin’s self‑destruction; imposed ancestral dreams). The price (career foreclosed) is explicit and scales to the length. A slight explanatory line in the peak (“built in their own justice”) softens edge but doesn’t blunt the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preserve a final spark against the encroaching Silence) is clear and escalates when the Silence reaches the grotto. The tightening beat (chip’s song forming a bubble as the entrance freezes) narrows options with a legible price—choosing suspension over motion or death. Agency drives the outcome through technique under pressure. Internal conflict remains more conceptual than dramatized, modestly limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (“source of contentment”) tightens through the climb and the encounter; knowledge deepens and narrows options toward acceptance. Pressure is coherent but soft; the disturbance functions more as an omen than a forcing constraint. The recognition that maps are unnecessary forecloses one path, but the price is understated. Overall escalation suits the lens, if not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres through deepening rather than reversals: the revelation “She found your real books” and the recalibration “You killed her with simplicity” sharpen the moral calculus. The dominant stake—can Marcus absorb complexity—tightens to a yes/no stance at parting. Cost is emotional and conceptual rather than enacted, but it’s legible. Slight talkiness limits the sense of foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (transferring forbidden knowledge) is clear, with one meaningful deepening at the “tenth ring inside the first” moment. Pressure accrues through trance density rather than conflict; agency lies in Elara’s chosen pedagogy and Marcus’s attention. The visible price is light on the page, tending to serenity over squeeze. Nonetheless the knowledge turn reweights options for Marcus credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres and tightens through pattern intensification: the wandering pulse draws in, vultures spiral, synchronization narrows options to a single poised act. The reversal—discovering the pulse is her own voice—reconfigures stakes from seeking origin to accepting endurance. Cost is felt in the relinquished path of movement. Escalation is quiet but unmistakable under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Primary stake (reclaiming meaning under automated perfection) is signaled early and tightened through the renunciation and the physical risk of mist walking. The turning choice (stepping out) narrows options and exacts a conceptual/identity cost. Pressure escalates via commitment: observation → risk → discovery → re-entry with changed stance. Stakes remain intimate but legible and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—claiming or rejecting the luminous vows—is present early and tightens as the ritual escalates perception to revelation. The decisive turn comes with speaking Elena’s name and accepting the vows, which deepens options into responsibility. The price is more inferred than dramatized on the page, keeping the escalation strong but not searing. Pressure remains coherent without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving the possibility of expansion—tightens through the intensifying static and the coins’ resonance until the stance crystallizes. The meaningful turn is the recognition that she is the decision, not its maker, foreclosing alternate agency. Cost is acceptance of an eternal, constrained role in an amber sanctuary. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial, but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—can she reframe her fear enough to carry on—tightens when the monsters gain substance, forcing the naming choice that diminishes them. The escalation is internal but legible and consequential; the price (ongoing isolation, duty resumed) is felt. A slight limitation: external pressure is low, so tension relies almost entirely on lyric intensification, which the piece largely sustains. The decision to continue and to leave a recording reads as earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible and pressured: can Mira restore the ocean without catastrophic collision. Escalation is cleanly staged through the three‑drop structure with the suspended third as a meaningful tightening. The price is present but soft (partial return, exhaustion) rather than a wrenching trade‑off. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not bail her out.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether to uphold the humane fiction or witness the erased truth—tightens via the discovery of Elena’s photo and the breadcrumb photography. The beat-to-beat pressure is coherent, culminating in a concrete commitment before officials arrive. The price is largely conceptual/social rather than immediate, so the felt risk is muted but present. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than a sharp reversal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (humanity vs hollow mastery) is signaled and tightened by the imminent Synthesis and the keep vs release dilemma. The birds’ patterning provides the decisive deepening that tips the choice. The price—letting the irreplaceable crystal vanish—is clear and alters options. Pressure is internal and quiet, but it escalates credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres: unfamiliar handler, the clock, and corporate stakes force Maya to choose allegiance now. The tightening turn is her reassessment upon hearing human breath and the subsequent lie. Costs are clear but mostly conceptual/oncoming rather than immediate and felt. The beat progression is clean without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: ending the numbness and resolving identity deadlock. Escalation is subtle but present—the jar’s proposed vivification reframes the goal from rivalry to synthesis via complementary opposites. The price remains mostly conceptual; no path is foreclosed in action yet, which trims urgency. Still, the decision narrows options and reweights the conflict credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving wild negative space against development—is signaled early, and the time‑boxed planting is a meaningful tightening. Escalation is primarily accumulative (roots glow, the haven cloaks itself, community gathers) rather than confrontational; agency drives the turn but meets little pushback. The resolution derives from her stance crystallizing, not a contested trade‑off. A tangible loss or risk paid on the page would clarify cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (restore laughter) and the pressure tightens via density—more blowers, deepening song—till the hush. However, there’s little resistance or trade‑off beyond stamina and grief; the ritual succeeds smoothly. The single meaningful tightening is the swell→fade that narrows options to the chosen method. The cost is felt but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (escape/rescue vs. guardianship) is clear and tightens when the Codex can take “two,” forcing a trade: leave or remain. The cost is legible—surrendering pendant, post, and bodily adaptations for uncertain wholeness. Escalation is mostly internal and gentle rather than contested, but it coheres and deepens. Resolution stems from her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove worth by creating power outside doctrine—is signaled early and escalates through a meaningful tightening: from restoration attempts to transformation, then personal sacrifice. The counted iterations and near‑failures function as progressive complications under the causal lens. The choice to burn the relic and bleed for the outcome forecloses a path and sharpens consequences (heresy, exile). Tension is steady and resolves via protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (finding and using the hush) tightens once: perigee creates a narrow window and the hush “door” reweights options. Escalation is more deepening than antagonistic; pressure is coherent but gentle, with low resistance beyond timing and technique. The end’s trade‑off—rejecting Guild monetization—supplies consequence. A sharper on‑page risk or failure beat could heighten the price.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (achieve convergence to end vanishing transit) is signaled early and tightened when the hourglass activates and he calls “all hands.” However, opposition is soft: coherence loss is noted but never bites, and convergence proceeds with little on‑page resistance. The price is present but the gauntlet is relatively gentle, keeping tension solid but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (complete the rational enchantment without collapsing logic or dream) is signaled early. Escalation arrives via increasingly violent eruptions and the need to hold balance; the thread’s depletion forecloses further work. The price and narrowing of options are present but mostly conceptual, with little lived resistance or counterforce on the page. A sharper on‑page risk/penalty during the climax would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on expanding human navigation; tension rises via skepticism turned to wonder and the Depth Dweller’s intervention. Escalation is predominantly informational; no option is truly foreclosed, and cost remains abstract. Agency exists but operates in a teaching register rather than under pressure. The piece persuades and reveals more than it tests.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—halt the Silence—emerges early and tightens through the photograph’s erasure and the dirge clue. The meaningful deepening is the shift from anomaly to crime (harvested memories) that narrows options to a specific locus. Cost is mostly conceptual; there’s urgency but little visible sacrifice or risk on the page. The off‑stage antagonist keeps pressure coherent but not fully sharpened.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover memory/honor promise before the tide—remains coherent and tightens via the clock and the chamber operation. A clear deepening occurs with the discovery of encoded messages and the decision to “return” Marcus through phases. Cost is felt in the acceptance that she cannot save them and must carry silence. Escalation is steady rather than jagged; no mid-scene snag beyond time pressure slightly softens peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (identity reclamation vs evolution) is signaled early and tightens as Marcus initiates the risky ink‑bridge and engages the ghost. The major deepening arrives with the defragmentation and the realization that the ghost is not a bug but a path. The choice to accept dual existence (and plan to teach others) reads earned under the accumulative pressure. The cost is implied rather than viscerally dramatized, slightly softening the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preserve a dying language before dawn) is clear, with a credible clock that tightens options. Escalation deepens through the curse’s activation and the pattern recognition turn with the starlings, leading to all‑night labor. The price is the acceptance of hybridization and ultimate incorporation into the canyon’s system. Tension is more poised than perilous, but pressure coheres and rises under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (complete vs. foreclose metamorphosis) is signaled early, and pressure tightens via the increasingly directive phone confessions. The decisive turn—Marina’s public acceptance—resolves both external and relational strands. Resistance is minimal (Thorne converts quickly), and the price is more implied than tested. Tension is present at beat and story scales but stays gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early: awaken the orchard/spirits at the risk of Council reprisal. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens: small notes to systemic upheaval; Council alarms tighten pressure and foreclose retreat. The cost remains forward‑leaning (enforcement incoming), but consequences are palpably set in motion (breaking clockwork hearts). Agency drives the turn; no convenient rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—delivering contraband to the Keeper to sustain cross‑border connection—is clear and steady. Escalation is modest: the drones’ ballet and the Keeper’s arrival deepen charge, but there’s little jeopardy or forced trade‑off at the hinge. Ezra’s agency drives the outcome, yet the path is smooth, with cost mostly implied rather than tested. One concrete pressure point foreclosing an option would lift the band.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (will he remain in silence or cross into voice) tightens through a single decisive deepening. The elongated chime and the halo fragment narrow options toward a choice point, and the act of fitting the shard triggers the irretrievable step of singing. The escalation is gentle rather than punishing, but the cost—exposure, the end of his self‑protective stasis—is clear. Pressure coheres without an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (find where stories live) are clear and escalate via density: marginalia in his grandmother’s hand, scarf warmth, then totalized vision. Pressure is primarily interior and textural; there’s one meaningful tightening but limited foreclosed options or visible price. The final acceptance is earned but low‑risk. Still, the cadence shift at midnight works as a credible intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: complete the vitalization or protect her own capacity for love. Escalation is marked by the figure’s increasing solidity and the felt cost in her chest. The decisive turn is her refusal—agency that narrows options permanently. Consequences land in the soft but weighted aftermath on the row back.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (free the idea from fear) is clear; pressure tightens via the star’s selection, the fear‑web’s tactile danger, and the last‑tumbler moment. Agency is Vera’s endurance and deft “untangling,” with a visible price (blood, time dilation). Stakes remain a touch abstract, but the web’s physicalization keeps tension present. Resolution is earned by her persistence, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake and tightens when the memories surface as both gift and wound. The key turn is Margaret choosing to accept not just Gran’s memories but the community’s pain, paying a visible cost. Escalation is steady rather than sharp; no external resistance appears, keeping the sequence a touch smooth. Still, agency drives the resolution with consequences that reweight the world.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (reversing the exile) is clear, and pressure tightens at the spiral break and the reveal of the mother’s messages. The choice to withhold the shard until Kess commits to learning functions as a narrowing tactic with emotional cost. Escalation is intellectual/emotional rather than perilous, but it coheres and deepens options. Stakes remain intimate; a single further test of the method under friction could heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear—preserve wonder—and pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. The meaningful tightening is the dawn threshold and the act of cutting apertures. Yet there’s minimal resistance or reversal; success feels assured once the ritual begins, and cost remains mostly conceptual. Tension lives in cadence, not in contested outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and legible: restore masks to ground spirits. Escalation is a steady densifying—from first knot to chorus of masks to spectral emergence—culminating at dawn; the tightening arrives via pattern intensification rather than reversal. The price (time, unraveling the net, bodily/psychic strain) is felt but subtle. A touch more jeopardy or friction would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure tightens from scrutiny to interpretation to commitment: the ritual persists; the coordinates exist; she decides to reopen the chapel’s purpose. Stakes remain internal but coherent, and the deepening reweights options (map vs presence). The price is more inferred than dramatized, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes—document/understand before the pocket collapses; accept preservation vs release—tighten as the air shrinks. The on‑page turn is the decision to write a note, take artifacts, and leave, foreclosing the option of continued study in situ. Cost and consequence are clear though the pressure is lyrical rather than combative. A single sharper beat of risk to extraction could heighten escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (achieve mutual communication) is signaled early and tightens at the lightning strike. Escalation is a deepening of clarity and obligation rather than adversarial reversal; it works for the lyric lens but carries modest cost. The decisive move is her commitment to teach and encode, with the environment imposing a live clock. Stakes remain intimate and emotionally scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure builds via the elevator’s ascent and informational reveals; the tightening is felt in the shuddering machinery and narrowing walls. Stakes are primarily internal and epistemic; external jeopardy remains low, so the cost reads as chosen solitude and responsibility rather than acute risk. The meaningful turn is clear when coordinates point behind the astrolabe and the diary reframes Thorne. Coherence never wobbles, but escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (prove the theory through untethered observation) is legible, and the entry into the storm offers a single meaningful tightening. Escalation is primarily conceptual and textural, not confrontational; the price (safety, return) is present but not sharply tested on the page. No major reversal, but the quiet deepening is consistent with the lens. Stakes feel intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is coherent: a dawn deadline and imminent demolition drive Lyra’s decisions, with the coin’s spiral reweighting her task. Escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, culminating in completion at 4:47 and the machines’ approach—visible cost. Conflict remains more inward and procedural than oppositional, but the narrowing options are legible. The guild’s arrival adds human stakes without diffusing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (decoding/wayfinding) is clear and coheres; the meaningful tightening is the recognition that birds “write” with light and motion, altering tactics. The price—solitude, time, and endurance (engine winding, winter closing in)—is felt but understated. Pressure escalates texturally rather than via confrontation, which fits the lens but limits visceral stakes. The final decision to continue aligns with the reframed stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (village’s lost starlight; internal repair) are established early and deepen as the prophecy and gear assembly refract her failure. Escalation is a cadence shift rather than a reversal, tightening when the mirrors frost and the village/vault appear. The on‑page cost is mainly a renunciation—waiting for the eclipse and relinquishing force. Some tension remains quiet, but pressure coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (saving orchards/community) is clear and escalates from isolation to collaboration. The key tightening is the discovery that immunity requires cross-boundary diversity, forcing fence removal and shared risk. Resistance is largely off-page, making the path feel smoother than ideal, but the turn still narrows options credibly. The cost—ceded separateness and Marina’s departure—lands.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are dominant and coherent: adjust the manner of humanity’s end. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge and tactic (from microsecond adjustments to song) rather than clash; it tightens once around the vouchsafe and the climb. The lack of on‑page resistance or credible cost beyond acceptance softens tension. Still, the decisive act is protagonist‑driven and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (saving the travelers under time/bird pressure) is signaled and tightened by the frost countdown. The meaningful turn is the seed handoff, which imposes a lasting cost and resolves the immediate crisis. Escalation is quiet but coherent under a situational lens; no deus ex machina. A touch more on-the-page jeopardy in transit could have sharpened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (mending with Elena) is legible early, and pressure coheres as Marina tests and revises her approach until she risks vulnerability. The meaningful tightening occurs when observation converts to action (send vs. delete), foreclosing her prior tactic of control. Cost is visible but moderated by the swift affirmative reply. Still, escalation reads as a purposeful cadence shift consistent with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early, and pressure tightens when Merrick chooses the “sharp incisors” and risks unraveling endings embedded in life. The building’s reaction escalates the scene texturally. The price is more conceptually felt than viscerally paid, but the trade‑off (safety vs. erasing endings) is credible. Resolution flows from Merrick’s professional stance and the child’s committed desire.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: whether to bear the fortress’s stored remorse. Pressure tightens from discovery → choice → full contact with escalating cost (“like a sandstorm”). The resolution is a self‑sacrificial endurance that forecloses the walk‑away path and alters tomorrow’s options. Slightly linear but clean and felt at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are clear (revive a dying district through sound) and the pressure coheres as the choir grows and the community is drawn in. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The piece lacks a marked tightening that exacts a visible price or forecloses a live option. Still, the communal gathering by dawn reads as an earned deepening of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she can/should rewire herself to access the mirror’s entangled memories—tightens via the first injection and ensuing vision cascade. The escalation is internal but discernible, with the physical/psychic tremors serving as price. There’s limited reversal; the path is chosen early and never truly threatened, which tamps peak pressure. Still, the final choice to carry and study the fragments functions as an earned deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (find combinations before the inversion ends) is signaled early and tightened by environment and clock. The principal deepening is the discovery of nodes and the hidden method to reenter the sealed wing, which raises future stakes. Prices are mostly conceptual; immediate physical risk is implied more than dramatized. Still, pressure coheres and options narrow under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates texturally as sound layers accrue and Mira must maintain tenderness to avoid “creating new silence.” The dominant stake—coaxing song without harm—tightens through her tool heating and the choice to stop at noon with the insulator newly cracked. Cost is present but modest; there’s no antagonist or reversal beyond technique discipline. Still, the deepening is coherent and culminates in a reweighted stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early: return to the Academy or remain. Pressure tightens once with the imminent end of the covenant, the charged game, and the passing of the stone. The escalation is quiet but coherent; the choice forecloses a live option with visible cost. A slightly sharper immediate resistance or counter‑pull could have heightened tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (unlocking the diary before midnight) is signaled early and tightens via time pressure and intensifying clicks. The decisive adjustment (one final decimal) is earned by prior tuning; the communal stillness deepens rather than merely coinciding. Prices are implied (months of work, choosing listening over breaking) rather than sharply dramatized in‑scene. Escalation is clean but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—proving readiness by cultivating the bloom—tightens through a pattern deepening from rote care to embodied understanding; the shoot’s emergence is the meaningful turn. The climax asks her to endure overwhelming sensation, foreclosing her prior impatience. Pressure is lyrical rather than adversarial; costs are modest but legible. A sharper on‑page test from an opposing force could heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible and time pressure is established, but escalation is gentle: obstacles are navigated smoothly and resistance is low. The single tightening beat is the Inversion, which the protagonist has prepped for, so cost never bites. Resolution hinges on discovery plus activation rather than a pressured trade‑off. Tension is present but never acute.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (understand/contain a growing convergence) is early and sustained; escalation arrives at the shimmering center with contradictory readings. The meaningful tightening is her choice to shift from analysis to perimeter action, foreclosing a riskier path. The price is more conceptual than visceral, so tension remains coolly procedural. Still, pressure grows coherently to the charged exit.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (certify wonder to stop the bells’ destruction) is clear, and pressure builds through the poised strike to the aurora’s descent. Escalation remains mostly unopposed; once she begins, success unfolds with little complication or visible cost. The meaningful tightening is the revelation that the score is for the aurora, not bells. A counterforce on the page or a trade-off would deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—learning to interface worlds safely—is clear, and pressure coheres as Kessa moves from sealing to weaving. The meaningful tightening is the shift from chaotic whispers to structured knowledge and the on‑page exchange with the figure. However, resistance is minimal; the new method succeeds without a test that forces a trade‑off beyond doctrine. The cost reads more as stance than sacrifice, tempering escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres as internal escalation: the overlay of selves, the angelic grief, and the dwindling constellation tighten toward identity loss. The live clock of disappearing stars and the warming halo deepen stakes. Agency appears as chosen endurance and production (printing a hundred adaptive sheets), culminating in a costly stance. Slightly abstracted stakes keep the tightening just shy of visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure builds via density and revelation rather than confrontation; the tightening moment is the Convergence manifesting because of her resonance. Stakes remain primarily internal (identity and vocation), with the price framed as responsibility rather than loss or risk. The escalation is coherent but soft—no path is foreclosed beyond the acceptance of duty. Satisfying within mode, but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is established early (gain proof), with a clear tightening when frost appears and the sun threatens to erase the evidence. Escalation is primarily textural/knowledge deepening rather than a hard trade‑off; the main choice is to document quickly, not to sacrifice. Pressure remains coherent; cost is present but muted. A slightly sharper dilemma would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset and tightens as the silence actively tests and consumes cherished memories. Escalation is driven by Mei’s agency at the loom; each pass narrows her remaining self until her name is forfeited. The decisive turn arrives as she uses the amber thread to send her daughter’s name, after which her options are foreclosed. The cost is visible and lasting, with no soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming exploited dreams into a tool of recovery—is clear. Pressure escalates through the descent and forging cadence, but obstacles are minimal and Korin is rarely tested. The meaningful tightening is the move into the “thin” chamber where intention shapes metal. Consequences for the merchant register; Korin’s costs remain mostly off‑stage.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (find mother/understand withheld truth/save realities) are clear, and pressure accumulates via increasingly intense redirects. The key tightening is the revelation of harm caused by map makers, which reweights Kira’s options and leads to her repair decision. The price is mostly conceptual; there’s little on‑page loss, resistance, or trade‑off to heighten tension. Still, the escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring light/protecting both sailors and trapped keepers—is clear early and tightens as Elsa moves from shore to gallery to lamp. The meaningful turn is her decision to take the role and activate the lamp via intention. Pressure is steady, if gentle; obstacles are internal and atmospheric rather than antagonistic. The price is acceptance of enduring solitude refigured as purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent: guide the lost and recover dawn’s function. Escalation is clean via the sequence of ships, with the mirror‑twin as the real tightening; the harmonic laughter forecloses a prior solo path. The price is more metaphysical than visceral, keeping tension elevated but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on whether Kael will be crushed by accumulating stories or learn a releasing method; pressure tightens meaningfully at the donor reveal and the wing demonstration. The decisive stance (“illuminate rather than absorb”) is earned but the escalation remains gentle, with minimal on‑page cost beyond conceptual risk. No antagonist is needed, but the conflict stays primarily internal and instructional. The final commitment does foreclose the passive path.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes cohere around reinterpreting the labyrinth and choosing transformation; the “pin drop” beat and discovery of encoded grief deepen pressure. Escalation is quiet but legible: from routine repair to reconfiguring the place’s meaning and architecture. The price is subtle—repurposing a precise instrument and committing to an all-night retrofit. Tension is more contemplative than perilous, but it still tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—rekindling dawn—tightens as solitary singing evolves into communal chorus, culminating in the greenhouse’s shudder and bloom. The meaningful deepening is the community joining and the trees remembering, with a clear price (ongoing ritual labor). The path lacks a sharp on‑page setback or reversal; resistance is atmospheric more than adversarial. Still, the turn from memory to manifestation is earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—bearing others’ pain versus protecting himself—is clear and tightens when the woman’s grief hits and he must choose approach with boundary. The midnight cadence shift adds pressure and frames the endurance choice as an earned stasis with cost. Escalation is modest but purposeful under the accumulative lens. No false complications; the price (self‑denial, empathic overload) is on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accrues via a pattern break (bread → door → spirit reveal) that reweights the stake from curiosity to responsibility. The deepening is clear but low‑friction—no counterforce challenges her choice beyond implied commitment. The decisive turn is the bread “uncloaking” and the condition that the tea house remains only if tended. Stakes are meaningful yet contemplative, not adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear early (save what can be saved before collapse), and a meaningful tightening occurs when she can save only fifty and then encounters an immeasurable vow. The founder’s projection reweights options rather than tidily resolving them, forcing Elara’s renunciatory decision to accept loss and seed anew. Prices are legible: triage, irreversible loss, and institutional collapse. Escalation is steady more than jagged, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are established early and meaningfully tighten at the badge reveal; the “you have until the tide changes” ultimatum is a decisive narrowing. The cost is legible: complete the recording but lose the place and invite danger. Resolution leans smooth—the woman’s allowance and the quiet arrests reduce bruising on the page—but pressure remains coherent. Tension operates across dialogue, image, and the live clock.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around the timed forest election and the approach of other carriers, tightening as the spruce transmits and Simon reframes the premise. The decisive deepening is Marina revaluing her stance and activating her first weather. Stakes stay largely internal and metaphysical; concrete costs are implied but not felt as losses. The escalation cadence is effective if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (risking the safety of memory to create) tightens decisively when the second painting confronts Lyra. The choice to draw on crystal rather than in her sketchbook forecloses a path. External pressure is light, so tension relies on internal stakes and cadence shifts, which mostly hold. A slightly greater sense of jeopardy or sacrifice in the act could have intensified cost.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—exposing suppressed truths versus preserving peace—is signaled and coherently tightened as Vera moves from discovery to action. The grandmother’s confession reweights risk and catalyzes the commitment to deliver all messages. On‑page resistance is light; conflict is more investigative and ethical than adversarial. Nevertheless, the turn at the tubes functions as a meaningful deepening that narrows her ethical options.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (preserve wonder before the melt) is clear and tightens as the fragment intensifies and dissolves. The key turn—pressing ice to bronze and re‑tuning the bells—earns the transformation and forecloses the option of preserving the fragment itself. Pressure is elegant more than combative, with minimal resistance on the page. The felt price is the loss of the last pre‑change relic.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (stabilize self without breaking the dome), and pressure coheres as each fear burns with contained risk. The longest‑burning final fear creates a discernible tightening. Cost is more conceptual than visceral but present in the live threat of collapse and the foreclosed option of leaving. Resolution flows from M-47’s disciplined agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (restoring Elena’s connection/voice) is legible with one meaningful tightening: recovering the letters. Escalation is steady but gentle; resistance is mostly situational, with little friction beyond time and systems. The quick postal resolution lowers felt cost despite emotional payoff. Agency is present (Marta’s decision to go, community coordination) and earns the end.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unlocking forbidden data/legacy—is legible and escalates via an intensifying choreography and the required reversal sequence. The tightening is present (performing and then unweaving the dance), but the price paid is conceptual rather than felt; no tangible loss or foreclosed option is dramatized. Agency drives the turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve. The pressure stays coherent but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—whether to reclaim buried memories—tightens credibly when the coffin of vials reframes the choice with immediate, personal cost. The escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than multiple reversals, appropriate for the length. The final trade-off (keep one, rebury the rest) is a real price. Minor softness: external pressures (city destabilization) stay largely ambient rather than forcing a sharper time-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is tight and on-page: silence the prophecy before it propagates. Pressure escalates texturally—bursts of script, gathering fragments, the wing unfolding layers—culminating in the night-long channeling to the sea. The piece favors competence under strain over jeopardy, so the price feels more ethical than visceral. Still, the resistance and time passage deliver one meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will open her secret practice to Marcus—tightens as he reveals lineage (his grandmother) and asks to be taught. The reversal is gentle but meaningful: from ritualized neighborliness to apprenticeship. The price is implied (giving access, surrendering solitude) rather than tested on the page. One concrete tension or counter‑pressure (what she risks losing) would deepen the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the archived self—tightens as signal clarity rises and Marina shifts from listening to excavation to fusion. Agency drives the turn; finding and joining the halves is her earned act rather than coincidence resolving the conflict. The cost is implied more than viscerally felt at the climax, modestly dimming pressure. Still, the cadence shift at dawn credibly narrows options and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early (brother’s life vs. ending the bloodline’s treason). Pressure coheres and tightens through the key’s activation and the literal burning of both options, foreclosing paths. The cost is unmistakable in the confession’s exposure. Tight, internally driven escalation suits the chosen lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—join the chorus or keep the secret—tightens through progressive disclosure (names, vanishings reframed) and the grandmother’s urgent call. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens: the canyon’s responses and the shell’s resonance intensify until refusal would be a meaningful renunciation. The cost is unmistakable on the page; dawn as a soft clock adds cadence pressure. A single, strong deepening rather than multiple reversals suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (recovering/decoding the antidote and bearing proof) are clear early, and pressure deepens through the shrine’s responses and the chemist’s timed fading. The meaningful tightening is the revelation of the encoded formula and the broader quest map. However, conflict meets little resistance—no on‑page obstacle contests her deciphering—so escalation feels contemplative more than testing. The dawn fade provides a mild clock.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes center on honoring and enacting invisible labor; escalation comes via pattern-density and the hum aligning with firefly wingbeats and tide pulse. The decisive tightening is the completion of the net and the deliberate choice to remain anonymous. Cost is legible but quiet, more conceptual than embodied. Within an accumulative design, the pressure coheres and deepens once as required.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes—expose the truth vs. preserve a sanctuary—are legible early and tighten through the accumulating letters and the physical discovery. The dust storm adds a live clock; the ethical trade-off carries a felt price (foregoing the career-defining expose and potential wider salvation). Escalation is primarily knowledge-deepening that narrows options. The resolution arises from Marcus’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (midwifing the Prophet’s emergence) is clear, with a meaningful tightening when the dead frequency blooms and she answers by broadcasting patterns. Pressure builds coherently through the storm to dawn, but the on‑page price is abstract and the conflict largely avoids a trade‑off or foreclosed path. The resolution leans on external validation (the Prophet’s words) rather than a costly choice. Still, the cadence shift reweights her role credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—bridging generations—tightens through the decision to find the owner and the on‑page encounter with Elena. The emotional price (letting others in; facilitating forgiveness) is legible, and the cadence shifts at the bench scene and final jar. External resistance is light, with little friction in the search, tempering escalation. Still, agency drives the key turn and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (keep the artifact/covenant) is signaled early and tightens under the clock of sunset/darkness. The meaningful turn is Mira’s choice to fuse with the artifact, foreclosing a human path with visible cost. External pressure (Collectors breaching) coheres, even if direct confrontation is elided. A slight absence of on‑page obstruction inside the vault holds it just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (disrupt the Council’s synchronization) is clear and tightens through the timed window and circuit‑completion. Escalation is quiet but present: assembling the circuit, coordinating multiple sanctuaries, and the field’s palpable shift. The price is largely endurance and the risk of social fallout, with little pushback on the page, softening bite. Still, agency drives the turn and narrows options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (whether to stay an observer or become a liberator) is clear and tightens as memories intensify. The decisive tightening occurs when Margot reframes Jerome’s death and resigns, foreclosing career stability. The price remains largely conceptual, not dramatized across beats. Still, internal and external pressures interweave coherently to an earned act.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (can an apology be made actionable) is signaled early and tightened by Eliza’s request for Marcus to stay. Escalation is quiet but real: the work itself becomes the test, and the ticking heart reweights options. The explicit price is emotional rather than external; low antagonistic pressure keeps ceiling just below elite tiers. Still, the on‑page choice to engage and continue constitutes credible agency.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transcending function into purpose—is signaled early and tightens as Pioneer moves from study to risk. The decisive beat (the dive) is protagonist‑driven and reweights options for all. Cost is largely conceptual (abandoning safety; catalyzing irreversible change) rather than materially felt, which mutes peak tension. Still, pressure coheres and deepens under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering/choosing the fate of the “missing”—tightens from anomaly to shadow network to joining. The meaningful turn is the father/frequency linkage reweighting the discovery into a personal decision. The price (self‑compression) is legible but not viscerally contested on the page. Still, pressure coheres and rises under the chosen lens without reliance on coincidence to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (how to engage the anomaly—exploit vs. cultivate) is signaled early and deepens via the mirrors’ revealed function. Escalation arrives through accumulating glimpses rather than a conflict turn; the tightening is Mira’s internal stance crystallizing. The price—foregoing enforcement posture—reads, but there’s little on‑page resistance or loss to heighten cost. Consequently, tension is elegant but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (how to stand with endings) is legible early and tightens with the midnight escalation and 3 AM calving that forces a stance. Agency is quiet but clear: she requests acceleration and chooses to remain, foreclosing the death path. The cost is felt more thematically than viscerally, but it still charges the end. Lack of a direct on-page jeopardy limits peak intensity, though coherence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether a life of renunciation yields anything transmissible—is signaled early and tightens with the daughter’s arrival. The escalation is quiet and accumulative; the creak of the door and revelation of saved letters raise pressure without full confrontation. Cost is felt rather than enacted; the price paid has accrued off-page and is cashed into a poised mentorship. Some stakes remain conceptual, leaving tension moderate rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (“preserve the echoes”) is clear and tightened by the “act tonight” clock. Escalation is primarily accumulative—ritual after ritual—with little friction or reversal; success comes without visible resistance. The cost is mainly stamina and vulnerability at the end. A stronger on‑page obstacle would deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve/transform memory before the site is erased) is clear, but escalation remains smooth—once Elara decides, the town arrives and everything works. The meaningful tightening is more conceptual (recognizing the spiral, then staging the reprise) than pressure‑driven. A credible on‑page obstacle or trade‑off would have deepened cost. As is, the resolution is earned yet relatively untested.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (proving language lives) is clear; escalation tightens from solitary observation to facing the Committee and choosing a risky method. The deepening is primarily conceptual rather than confrontational, consistent with the chosen lens. A felt price is implied but not pressed on the page (no immediate consequences), tempering urgency. Still, the method-choice narrows options and defines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (find/recognize the frequency of age) tightens when the woman arrives with degraded tapes, leading to an on‑page search and discovery. Agency is present in adjustments and the conscious acceptance of forgetting as a tactic, with the cost of endurance encoded. Pressure is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens; one sharper micro‑risk during the tuning would lift stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preventing temporal destabilization while choosing a stance toward escape) is signaled early and tightens. The tuning fork is a reversal that slows pressure, and the camera tactic deepens knowledge, culminating in a costly stance. Stakes stay coherent and escalate without coincidence, though resistance feels slightly friction‑light. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but it registers.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: execute a flawless goodbye under a live clock. Pressure coheres and deepens as she turns ambient machinery into an album and convenes the community, then forecloses her role by leaving the piece behind. Costs are legible (time, renunciation of role), but the path faces little active resistance or complication. One sharper on‑page obstacle would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible: prevent the leak/closing of reality loops as noon arrives. Pressure escalates coherently with the noon surge and the automaton’s reversal, forcing Lyra to act rather than observe. The cost manifests as acceptance of custodial ignorance rather than a visible sacrifice, slightly softening impact. Agency drives outcome; no coincidences resolve the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—acceptance vs. clinging—tightens modestly but clearly: the Council’s disapproval, the “Mother knew?” reveal, and the refusal to stay culminate in Thomas’s relinquishment. The escalation is quiet yet coherent under the accumulative lens, and the cost is felt. No major reversal, but a meaningful narrowing of options occurs. Stakes remain intimate and never diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (guiding boats through fog) is signaled early and deepens when the fleet visibly adjusts course. Escalation is gentle, driven by Marina’s agency (discover → wield → teach), with one meaningful tightening (deploying the light at the grotto mouth as boats depart). Prices are soft—no significant sacrifice beyond time and relinquishing exclusivity. Tension operates more through wonder than jeopardy, limiting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve a hard‑won sanctuary vs. respond to public exposure—tightens when Marcus arrives and asks “Teach me?”. The decisive proffer narrows her path by inviting another into the private space, with a felt price. Escalation is cohesive under the chosen lens, if quiet. A touch more resistance or consequence on the page would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—letting go of finishing/control—tightens through the vow and the shell’s hum as the apparitions take their light. The old woman’s pass‑through and uphill footprints deepen pressure without resolving it, maintaining coherence under the accumulative lens. Marina’s agency drives the turn (ceremony, renunciation), with a visible trade‑off. Stakes remain intimate but consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear (revival of sacred practices) and there’s a gentle tightening (tendril’s response, moon’s approach, communal voices). Yet resistance is minimal; the first tactic works and no meaningful trade‑off or loss alters tactics. Pressure remains coherent but soft, with little jeopardy or escalation beyond accumulation. The resolution is earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stake is the successful translation of the crater’s heartbeat into a permanent map; the tightening arrives at the ignition and frozen‑aurora moment. The choice to spend safekept starlight and commit the design forecloses retreat. Pressure remains coherent but largely ritualized rather than contested, limiting felt risk. The earned collapse into the warm plate provides a clean release with modestly legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around whether to fix or document as time phenomena intensify (dawn reflections to noon pre‑echoes). The noon shift tightens options by teaching repairs from the future, making her refusal to “fix” now a priced stance. Stakes remain intimate but legible; the cost is opportunity and ethical posture toward wonder. Escalation is measured rather than dramatic, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres as an internal stake: maintain patterns and capture heavier “weights” vs. the cost of remaining confined. Escalation is a clear density increase: whale-bone arches calcify, the burner heats, she adds the grotto’s weight. The meaningful tightening is an inward deepening rather than a hard reversal; it still narrows options by reaffirming the prison she chooses. Stakes remain felt even if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to relate to grief/time—tightens via the live clock (four minutes → two → whistle), pushing a purposeful acceleration and a choice to embody “containment” without hands. Escalation is subtle but legible under the accumulative lens; the kettle’s peak cues her decisive pause and the reframing choice. The cost is internal (acceptance/endurance) rather than externally punishing, yet it reads. A sharper on‑page forfeit beyond pace would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes concentrate around whether Kira surrenders old ambitions or reframes them; pressure tightens at the hand‑to‑hand contact with her ghost. The deepening—recognizing narrative time and role—narrows options credibly. The cost is felt (renouncing the builder identity) and the resolution proceeds from her agency. Quiet, but the cadence shift is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (revive/unlock the hidden system) is clear and escalates as the water groans to rhythm and the fountain arcs. The tightening comes from her active redirection and the system’s resistance. Yet tangible jeopardy or trade‑off is subdued; nothing meaningful is foreclosed or lost in pursuit of the win. The pressure deepens but rarely bites.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused: whether and how to rejoin music without abandoning the sanctuary. Pressure escalates texturally—petrichor memory and the sunrise’s reveal tighten the moment—culminating in a trade‑off choice. The cost is legible but gentle, more contemplative than fraught; no external counterforce presses back in scene. Still, the compromise forecloses the fantasy of singular devotion to either path.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether she will keep chasing legends or face the personal lie—clarifies early and deepens once the confession reframes her quest. The turn is measured rather than dramatic, but it narrows options toward a costly homeward decision. Pressure is internal and coherent, though the serenity trims visceral edge. Still, the end forecloses a path and signals real consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (preservation) is clear, and the second decoding sequence provides a mild deepening. Escalation is primarily textural; pressure comes from time (before dawn), cold, and inheritance responsibility rather than a hard turn. The final decision to teach narrows her options, but the price remains gentle. No true reversal, but the tightening suits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on whether Elara can convert unraveling into mapped meaning; pressure deepens via the Marcus shard and the thread’s responsive warmth. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than decisively causal, with one key tightening when she sees Marcus in the garden and binds the thread to herself. The cost (ongoing duty amid decay) is clear, though not viscerally tested. A slightly sharper on‑page trade‑off would raise tension.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (coaxing life/beauty back) is signaled early and tightens through the flawed hatching, forcing a stance: embrace imperfection or concede failure. The escalation comes via intensity (glow → cracks → song → deformity) and culminates in a meaningful acceptance with felt cost. Pressure remains coherent; a more acute tactical loss or foreclosed path would sharpen the sense of price. Still, the reweighting at the end is earned and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reframing legacy—tightens via the ritual’s assembly and the father‑shadow cloud image. The deepening (warehouse rescue memory) reweights the present act and raises the internal price. The resolution is an endurance/renunciation with felt cost rather than a reversal, appropriate to this length and lens. Slight softness in on‑page pressure keeps it just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unsticking the city’s memory to release the geese—is legible early and tightens once the feather is removed and the geese begin to drift. Escalation follows the accumulative lens: each fountain touch deepens pressure rather than flipping it, culminating in the first fountain’s flow and the geese’s release. Agency is present (they choose to perform the ritual), but overt cost and foreclosed alternatives remain muted. The conflict stays serene—effective for tone, less so for knife‑edge stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (endure the burden of solitary tending) is signaled early and deepened by the “troubling serenity.” The meaningful turn is her acceptance/renewal of duty at the end. However, pressure does not significantly narrow options in scene; it accrues more than it tightens. The cost is present but understated, keeping tension effective yet gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is coherent: complete a memorial that truthfully holds collective grief before the migration/voice passes. Escalation is a tightening of cadence and urgency (“The migration won’t wait”) and the communal test at the unveiling; the price is relinquishing the mentor and accepting communal holding. The pressure is more deepening than reversal, but the turn at completion is clear and paid. A slightly sharper on‑page trade‑off beat could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: restoring communal time‑trust, with the ritual as escalation via accumulating names and a culminating admission. The meaningful tightening is the final inscription triggering the clock’s precise swing. External antagonism is minimal, making the conflict largely internal and ritualistic; price is implied rather than dramatized through loss or opposition. Still, the cadence shift at closure reweights options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are primarily existential—how to hold and translate grief—escalating through the decoding into a stance about return and time. The meaningful tightening arrives when she doesn’t restart the clock and commits to planting the fragment, foreclosing possession. Pressure remains coherent but quiet; the conflict is internal and thematic rather than antagonistic. The visible price is surrender and patience rather than loss dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear: stop “suffocating protocols” by redirecting the Council’s behavior today. Pressure coheres via the impending meeting and the secret installation of maps, but opposition stays largely ambient; escalation is a quiet tilt rather than a squeeze. The meeting’s transformation is a meaningful tightening, yet the path feels low‑risk and consequence‑light. The price (invisibility, manipulation) is present but underplayed.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—seeding imagination under authoritarian control—is clear, with one meaningful tightening when the pirate lyrics address Mariel directly and the signal wavers. However, escalation remains gentle; no option is starkly foreclosed, and the price (detection, harm) is implied rather than tested on the page. The piece maintains tension but doesn’t force a hard trade‑off within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is whether art can grant refuge or absolution before consequences arrive; pressure coherently mounts (the chair’s slowing, his death, engines, doors bursting). Marlene’s agency—completing the ritual, donning the mask, erasing the portrait—forecloses options with cost. The deepening revelation that ash equals evidence escalates ethical stakes. No wasted beats; the tightening is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates coherently: Marcus challenges the official narrative, the historian counters with complicating evidence and a hidden motive, and the stakes pivot to how truth will be preserved. The “We know” beat is a meaningful tightening that redefines options. The cost is implicit but legible in Marcus’s acceptance of secrecy. Slightly low on visible external jeopardy keeps it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can communal practice outlast institutional loss—is signaled early and deepens as players arrive and the ensemble finds the five modes. The key tightening is her admission of limits and the collective tactic to “find the others,” culminating in the costly hand‑off of the rosette. Pressure remains coherent and grows through density rather than reversals. The conflict is quiet; one sharper beat of risk or potential fracture would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—seed the rebellion under the moons—stays coherent and tightens as the activation window narrows and the network spreads. The escalation is primarily density/texture rather than obstacle; there’s little friction once the process starts. Cost is implied (risk from the Ministry, relinquishing the old restaurant) rather than tested on-page. The resolution is protagonist-driven but lacks a hard turn that forecloses a live option.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens decisively when she activates the broadcast, foreclosing secrecy with clear risk. The honesty curse pressures tactics and removes evasion, forcing a high‑stakes choice. The ending’s gentle reception softens the edge of consequence, trimming peak tension. Still, internal and external stakes interweave credibly and escalate once as required.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are internal—understanding and stewardship—and intensify as the shard reveals the bay’s function. The decisive tightening is Marina’s choice to place the heirloom on the sand, paying a personal price to join the sanctifying circuit. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A slight softness remains in on‑page resistance before the offering.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around whether the truth will be told and how Thessaly will be seen; the revelations narrow Marina’s options credibly. The decisive deepening arrives with the dolphins/seawall memory, forcing moral calculus. The cost is made explicit and carried into the close, though the present‑scene risk is largely reputational rather than immediate. Tension sustains without gimmick or coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—escape the closed system—tightens via the seven‑step pattern, entropy accruing in the chip, and the terrifying loop length tied to Sarah. Pressure coheres, but escalation remains largely conceptual; no single on‑page beat forecloses a tangible option beyond the chosen endurance. The price (time, isolation, regret) is felt but not newly intensified at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (break the drought, honor memory, test if kindness persists) are established early and deepen as the brush “pulses,” the painting accrues, and the online post invites risk. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through confrontation; resolution comes smoothly via community validation. Little is foreclosed or lost on the page; the price is gentle and largely conceptual. The tightening is present but not exacting.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—save what can before the thaw erases it—is established early, with a meaningful escalation as scent intensifies, ice crashes, and the walls begin to blur. Agency is present in triage choices and frantic transcription. The price is unmistakable: loss on the page and acceptance of partial rescue. Slightly more tactical trade‑offs could have sharpened the turn further.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around the single stake of inverting the stone, with one meaningful tightening as the latent radiance intensifies and the stone “writhes.” The escalation is clean but largely competence‑driven; risk and trade‑off feel muted. The reversal “sound like time itself cracking” delivers the peak, but the price paid is more inferred than dramatized. Still, agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—liberating/transforming Fear—tightens through the pulsing mirrors and the backward incantation, culminating in a direct verbal gambit. Mara’s agency drives the decisive turn; coincidence doesn’t rescue her. The felt price is credible: she loses Cornelius and must carry the contained Fear. Escalation is clean, if slightly guide‑assisted.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and clear: break the recursive current. Escalation arrives as increased tempo/precision, environmental response (clouds, whales), and a culminating rupture. Agency drives the turn; coincidence aids but does not resolve. The on‑page price skews physical/energetic rather than a sharper loss, keeping it just shy of higher intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (knowledge vs. safety) is clear from the opening and tightens meaningfully at the watcher’s crack and the imperative “Do not follow.” The escalation deepens through reweighted world rules (watchers as warnings; turtles waking) and culminates in a deliberate, costly exit choice. Agency guides the turn rather than coincidence. A single additional obstruction on the exit path could have further sharpened the price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (truth vs stabilizing lie) is clear; pressure coheres around the Ministry’s demand and Marcus’s weapon hesitation. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presents the annotated parallels and he recognizes current events in them. Cost and danger are undercut by the “seventeen historians” reveal, making the choice feel safer. The final renunciation has consequence but not a strong on‑page price.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning against water and time—is established early and tightens via the structural shift, tide turn, and drawbridge schedule. Escalation is quiet but real: the building’s groan and chandelier’s proximity to water push him to act now. The decisive act (sealing the bottle) forecloses alternatives and accepts the cost of smallness/futility. Consequences remain live (condemnation, possible loss) and charge the plan to return.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserving authentic records before systems reactivate—is clear and tightens with the ticking blackout and discovery of more sophisticated forgeries. The meaningful turn is her “alternative hypothesis” leading to targeted page verification, narrowing options under time pressure. Cost is visible: she cannot finish; she accepts partial preservation and future risk. The pressure is coherent and grows without relying on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (transform grief without erasing love) is clear; pressure deepens via the unexpected “possibility” glimpse and the move to public lantern‑shrines. The cost is felt but remains largely internal and artisanal rather than forced by external pressure. Escalation is a measured intensification rather than a sharp foreclosure. The resolution is earned through Mei’s agency and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—steal time from the system to access and release trapped potential—is signaled early and coherently escalates via the early alarm and impending security. The decisive turn (transmit and reframe “harness” as “return”) narrows options and risks punishment. The conflict resolves a touch smoothly, with minimal felt loss beyond exposure, but the ethical tradeoff is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (decode/understand the message) is coherent, but pressure is gentle; puzzles yield without setbacks or trade-offs. The tightening is present (discovering the anomaly → sourcing matrices → completing the chord) yet lacks a felt price beyond effort. Agency is active but unopposed. Stakes remain largely conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—continue selling erasure or confront inherited harm—is signaled early and tightens as the carvings cohere into a damning map. The arrival of the anonymous watch hand adds external pressure, and the recognition “someone knows” escalates stakes. The renunciation forecloses a lucrative path with cost. Slight softness stems from the absence of an on‑scene adversary or immediate consequence beyond resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (conducting the exchange without succumbing to personal vengeance) is clear early and tightens when Thorne’s apology arrives and Elara sets the moral order: faith first, healing later. The “hold this” beat is a small but meaningful reversal that deepens pressure and reframes agency. Costs are conceptual/emotional rather than physical but are legible. Escalation is modest yet coherent under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can he navigate life after failure—tightens at pole nineteen, where past error meets present tactic. The reversal (turning back, counting poles in retreat) and the decision to teach are active choices with visible humility costs. Pressure is internal but coherent and grows through patterning rather than external antagonism. Stakes remain modest but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake (whether he accepts a costly empathy‑quest) is signaled early and tightened when the lake reveals specific lives altered by his crimes. The first path “beckons,” narrowing options and producing a concrete decision. Price is conceptual but clear—he must act without the narrative relief of apology and with persistent guilt pathways. A slightly sharper external consequence on the page could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reuniting with Kess—tightens when uncorking the vial irreversibly initiates metamorphosis. Pressure is internal and coherent, escalating as Mira’s edges blur and options foreclose. Cost is legible: self‑dissolution and prior expenditures (gold, favors, memories). The resolution emerges from her deliberate acceptance rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (recovering lost time to unshadow a birth) concentrate early and deepen as the crack glows, the mother appears, and the restoration spread is enacted. The escalation is quiet but coherent for the chosen lens; one decisive intensification (the spread “unfastening” moments) narrows options and commits Elara. The cost—accepting perpetual guilt and the bittersweet invisibility of the mother’s name—charges the resolution. A touch more resistance or risk during the ritual could have heightened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is explicit from the outset; pressure tightens as she locates the fracture and opens the fold, then must endure the torrent of violence to complete the stitching. Agency drives the turn, and the ethical calculus (meeting violence with compassion) is active. The cost is legible but modest—she holds steady without a tangible loss or forced trade‑off beyond endurance—keeping escalation strong but not searing. Still, the decisive act reweights options and resolves the central pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: to become/understand transformation at the cost of self. Escalation is a steady tightening—vibrant hush, synchronization, opening bottles, tactile shift in her body, celestial peak—culminating in dissolution. Agency is present in her preparation and the act of opening, even though cosmic forces loom. The price is unmistakable (loss of body/self), and the final image honors that cost.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—initiate the silent revolution without detection—is clear and tightens with Amara’s reveal and the imminent return of light. Escalation is subtle: completing alignment during blackout, then separating as lamps flare, leaves options narrower but not crisis‑spiked. The price remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. Nevertheless, the plan’s irreversibility at dawn supplies a credible tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on unlocking sacred patterns and accepting custodial duty; pressure deepens once the true eels arrive and history floods her. The key tightening is the reframing of her foresight with the consequent renunciation of mere herding for stewardship. Conflict remains mostly internal and conceptual with minimal resistance or trade-off on the page. The earned vow works, but escalation is a smooth swell rather than a squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are coherent: create subversion that passes censors; the live clock (timer, approaching dawn) and storm intensify the vigil. The tightening beat—“boldest yet,” then hiding it before the day shift—narrows options and commits her further. The price is ongoing risk rather than a sharp on‑page near‑miss, keeping escalation strong but not extreme.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—conducting a covert revolutionary dialogue through a public duel—is clear and coherently escalates as their “fencing” densifies and names “Revolution.” The tightening comes via the alignment of codes rather than a hard turn; agency is present in the choice to encode and match angles. Costs are mostly conceptual and deferred; no on‑page sacrifice or foreclosed path beyond secrecy. Tension operates, but never bites down hard.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (protect/build to resist standardization) is clear and coheres. Pressure deepens once—completion and imminent dispersal raise implied risk, with the coffee tin underscoring exposure. However, there’s no concrete on‑page test or narrowing of options beyond conceptual danger; the train whistle teases threat without tightening. The resolution is earned, but escalation remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates coherently: a stronger storm, jittering compasses, the condensation-marked hand, then Marion’s risked improvisation. Agency drives the turn—she abandons the score to force a corridor. The cost is primarily emotional/temporal rather than immediate harm, keeping it shy of maximal intensity. The dominant stake (reuniting/creating a refuge) remains tight and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (island’s survival via classification) is clear and coherently tightened by the approaching monsoon and the contradictions inside the memories. The meaningful turn is Mira’s reframing—from coherence to multiplicity—prompted by evidence. The on-page price is chiefly reputational and epistemic, not a visceral loss, but it’s enough to charge the choice at this length. Tension escalates in sentence and beat scale without gimmicks.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (reconciliation vs. enduring silence) is signaled early and tightens through the lace’s sequential instructions and the compass’s behavior. The crucial narrowing arrives when the compass fixes on “cerulean” and Kenji opts to relinquish it and commit to writing tomorrow—an action with felt cost. Internal and external threads (teaching/pruning) interweave coherently. Pressure is quiet but escalates in density and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant internal conflict is developed with great depth, and the stakes—professional identity versus intellectual integrity—are high and personal.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    The central stake—finding meaning in the face of devastating loss—is established immediately and deepens throughout.

The cost of her discovery is her former life and colleagues, a constant, palpable pressure that makes her final triumph feel profound rather than easy.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—the need for rest—is signaled immediately and deepens profoundly from the personal to the civilizational.

    The central stake—the community's survival with dignity—is established immediately and tested under the constant pressure of the sanctions.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—finding the repository of unused love—is established early and pursued with focus. Pressure escalates not through external opposition but through a series of deepening revelations, fitting for an Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stake—escaping a conceptual prison—is established early and deepened effectively. The pressure escalates through the fading of the photographs and the disintegration of the fragment, forcing a final reckoning. The resolution is driven by Elara's agency as she interacts with the maze she designed, crystallizing her new stance on time. The cost is clear: the dissolution of the fragment and the memories it held, which is successfully reframed as a liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—humanity's future versus the Authority's control—is established early and effectively grounded in Marcus's personal struggle for freedom. The arrival of the arrow provides a decisive tightening, moving the conflict from endurance to action. The resolution is earned through Marcus's agency, and the final image lands with the palpable cost of his new, immense responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story establishes a clear, high-stakes internal conflict from the beginning. The pressure is expertly escalated not through external events, but through a deepening internal process as Elena works at the forge, forcing a confrontation with memory and absence. Her agency is clear in the choice to follow her grandfather's notes, leading to a resolution that redefines the stakes themselves. The cost is felt in the shift from a vengeful quest to a difficult, nuanced peace.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—the mother's need for truth—is established efficiently and resolved with significant emotional cost. The central conflict deepens decisively when the moonbeams are applied, forcing a re-evaluation of knowledge rather than a physical confrontation. This single, powerful turn is driven by protagonist agency and lands with an unmistakable price, making the resolution feel both earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a powerful dominant stake: whether an act of deliberate, fragile creation can reclaim a space of catastrophic failure. The conflict is primarily textural and thematic, escalating perfectly when the arrival of the couple tests Marina’s solitary ritual, forcing it into a communal purpose. Her final choice to hand over the sphere is a decisive act of agency that pays off the setup with a clear, felt cost—the acknowledgment that safety must be continuously crafted against an ever-present background of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes are clear, personal, and immediately escalated from a mystery to an existential threat ("Submit to reset protocol").

The final cost—the acceptance of a manufactured and dangerous identity—is unmistakable and charges the ending with a sense of grim empowerment, demonstrating a clear price paid for victory.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.4)
    The conflict is primarily internal but carries cosmic stakes, a difficult balance the story manages with grace. The dominant stake—completing her map of darkness—is clear from the start. The narrative deepens beautifully at the climax, where the oracle's realization doesn't resolve the conflict but transforms it, shifting the goal from an act of completion to one of endurance. The cost is unmistakable: she must trade her obsession for an "excruciating, beautiful patience."

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story establishes a strong, singular stake: understanding the origin of thought. The pressure is entirely internal and philosophical, and the introduction of the multi-timeline perception serves as a meaningful deepening of this conflict. While the resolution provides conceptual closure, the conflict lacks visceral tension or a sense of immediate loss, making the stakes feel abstract and the cost purely intellectual rather than tangibly felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—the restoration of relational trust—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict escalates not through action, but through the intensification of unspoken tension, which breaks in a single, decisive turn: their mutual confessions. This deepening of knowledge, driven by protagonist agency, forces a trade-off between their protective lies and a chance at honesty. The cost—three months of frozen silence and the ongoing fragility of their bond—is deeply felt and visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central conflict between willed belief and systemic determinism is signaled early and escalates effectively.

The resolution is driven entirely by Marta's agency with a clear, felt cost, making the victory earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)
    The central stake—proving a revolutionary theory of time—is established immediately and tested under clear pressure. The ticking clock of the "twilight hour" and the external pressure from Vasquez provide coherent escalation. Ira’s agency drives the conflict forward when she pushes the lever further despite the station shuddering, a choice that visibly raises the stakes from personal obsession to communal risk. The cost is clear and the resolution is earned entirely through her decisive, risky actions.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering the music before the program dissolves—is an excellent ticking clock that drives the narrative. Pressure escalates beautifully, moving from quiet study to a full-blown supernatural performance. The climax, requiring Marcus to step "deeper into the flood," provides a physical and symbolic intensification that is perfectly calibrated. The cost is legible in his complete surrender to the moment, a fusion of past and present, "drowning and playing."

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The conflict is primarily internal and intellectual, yet it carries immense weight. The stake—to understand an impossible truth—is established immediately and deepens with each discovery. The crucial tightening occurs when Mira chooses to trust her intuition over the official record, a decision that pays off in the climax. The resolution is not a victory in a conventional sense, but an acceptance of a burden, an earned and costly endurance that feels true to the story's core.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    The central stake masterfully deepens from physical exploration to a profound moral responsibility. The pressure builds through the chorus of radio voices, a brilliant device for escalation in an accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an Accumulative lens, the conflict works effectively through a single, decisive deepening rather than escalating turns.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story builds pressure effectively through an emotional and temporal deepening rather than conventional conflict. The dominant stake—the successful transmission of a legacy of wonder—is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story builds pressure effectively under an Accumulative lens, escalating the stakes from a simple discovery to a reality-altering revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central conflict—a philosophical deconstruction of a conceptual demon—is brilliantly conceived and escalated with textural density. The stakes are clear, and the resolution is earned directly through the protagonist's unique tactics. The only slight deflation of tension comes from Marcus's explicit disregard for the 17-minute time limit, which prevents an otherwise potent source of pressure from being fully leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story masterfully handles a metaphysical stake—resolving temporal dislocation—and makes it urgent through the clear, simple pressure of "before exhaustion hits."

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    The central stake—how to navigate overwhelming grief and a lost legacy—is established immediately and deepens with precision. The conflict escalates not through external opposition but through an internal surrender to memory, an act of agency with irreversible consequences. The choice to open the vial is the key turn, and the cost—a fundamental transformation of self—is made viscerally clear and is anything but a simple resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)

    Dominant stake—translating silence into music via thermal patterns—is signaled early and tightened through each experiment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira recognizes the plants are “composing,” narrowing her options from passive observation to active transcription.

    Dominant stake—liberate seeds or desert wins—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation tightens once: from guarded captive to active sower, the irreversible choice to leave empty-handed but seed-laden.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the frequency of betrayal—tightens when Elena shifts from capturing sound to imprinting absence. The meaningful turn occurs at the forge: her choice to absorb silence rather than sound narrows her options and raises the conceptual cost of understanding. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens; no external reversals required.

    A single, clear stake: will stolen light expose or console? Pressure tightens when the seventh frame’s re-cast expression threatens both Cassia’s reputation and the mother’s grief.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-ownership vs engineered obedience—tightens once via the decoded formulas that turn fear into power.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—map the final darkness—remains coherent. Pressure tightens once: the expected extinction stalls, forcing patience. Agency is endurance, but the visible price (another night of isolation) is understated; escalation is more cadence shift than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)

    Chronic hush is the dominant stake; musicians gather because Mara’s note cracks it, tightening pressure without forced reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—harvesting usable half-truths before the grotto seals—is signaled early and tightens as the petal darkens. One meaningful deepening: the pull to subsume versus the rule never to consume. Cost is felt in the renunciation, though external stakes (the widower) remain off-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—grafting the lost artist back into communal memory—tightens via each mapped tag; the spiral discovery forces a collective stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—free the trapped extinctions—tightens once Marina discovers the chamber and must choose: keep her illustrations or release their endings.

Pressure escalates through accumulation: more artifacts demand more interpretive labor, narrowing Kessa’s options to either freeze the archive or let it remain porous.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—map the unmappable—is signaled early and tightens through each arrow. One deepening: the fortress reveals itself as architecture of unspoken truths, reweighting the cost of knowledge. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—breaking the debt—is signaled early and tightens once when the bead pulses faster. The ghost’s announcement that “the barrier thins” forces the decisive release.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming drowned ruin into living myth—is signaled early and escalates through each stitched overlap. The tightening occurs when the children leave the plate and animate the stone, foreclosing nostalgia and crystallizing new possibility; the cost is the irreversibility of the old world’s death.

    The narrative situates an aftermath—not a living argument—so stakes stay reflective rather than tension-bearing. Pressure accumulates via theme density rather than option narrowing; no on-page obstacle or reversal forces a trade-off. Cost is implied in Marcus’s solitude and the upcoming reputational risk, but it is legible more as stance than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—honoring erased histories—tightens as each knot marks lost years and every dissolving tower forecloses permanence. Agency is renunciation: Mira chooses to let the structures melt, paying the price of invisibility. One clear escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—”preserve forgotten names”—tightens through agency: every loosened strand risks erasing the very voices she wants to keep. A single, deepening beat occurs when the card reveals “Elsa”: knowledge narrows the path to personal inheritance and irreversible transformation. Cost is continually paid—braid lost, wax burned, identity braided into bronze—until the rope is no longer storage but instrument.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“why some paths choose their walkers”—is signaled early and tightened by the countdown beats. The storm’s live clock and rising water force stance crystallization; the cost is the irreversible loss of linear agency, visible when Kira steps into light already knowing she’ll return younger.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—prove that devotion measured in years and numbers can bridge cosmic distance—is tested by the escalating resonance that demands her voice and charts as final currency. Pressure tightens once: Mars aligns, tile warms, palace awakens; no reversal, but the narrowing is decisive and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—teach release of inherited resentment—signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the Magistrate’s arrival forces the test. Escalation is one meaningful deepening: cellular memory rewrites rage into grief, foreclosing vengeance. Cost is legible in the father’s silent tears and the unbroken fever’s imminent break. Agency remains Marcus’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can the astronomer re-inhabit his lost vision without shattering reality? Pressure tightens through synchronized breathing—each inhale narrows the gap between earth and sky until the final mirror crystallizes the cost. Escalation is Accumulative: density of light and memory increases until stance must shift.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: save the quartz eyes or lose patients’ sight forever. One meaningful tightening: Elara’s choice to break her vow after seeing the dying crystals. Escalation is causal—each healed eye brightens the orchard, raising the stakes visually. Cost is the reopened emotional wound and political risk.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept recursive inheritance—tightens once when she carves the message she will later find. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt until the final bite. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—access vs. entrapment—is signaled early and tightens through each level: the circular room’s logic test, the amber museum, the mountain’s demand. Agency is high; Mira’s linguistic choices narrow options and escalate cost. The release of the seekers provides visible consequence, though the price she personally pays (eternal chronicler) is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove her twin existed—tightens when Coraline offers the choice to pin or keep the card. Agency drives escalation: Marina’s refusal costs her the ease of forgetting. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—endured abandonment versus possibility of return—compresses and turns once with on-page cost. Each beat tightens: Mira’s solitary tending → discovery of shard → literal rekindling choice, with each step foreclosing the possibility of remaining in safe, known silence. The “impossible soil” line crystallizes felt stakes when the cost is revealed—hope now must germinate in ruins. Coincidence (shard’s precise placement) serves only as escalation, never resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving human identity via shared memory—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Lyra shifts from observer to active archivist, foreclosing passive nostalgia. Cost is felt in the irrevocable loss of the world below. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—defy the Dimming’s despair—is signaled in paragraph four and tightened when the first rocket’s sustained bloom proves the tactic viable. Agency is communal yet led by Kaia’s micro-choice to share technique; the cost is the kerosene knot’s slow, irreversible burn. One clear escalation: from solitary chant to collective ignition that narrows the future to continuous making.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Chen’s retreat from the burden of foresight vs. Mira’s insistence on witnessing transition—is signaled early and tightened by the single wave that rearranges the grotto. Escalation is textural: each pool’s micro-transition accumulates until Chen’s stance crystallizes. Cost is visible in his reluctant nod and the implied return to chronicling. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the tide merely underscores stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—collecting silence vs inherited fear of openness—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: inversion tightens the window to forty minutes, forcing the harvest. Cost is the irreversible fracture of the doll and the weight of the vials. Agency is active (uncorking, dancing with gravity). No coincidence resolves; the doll’s sprout is foreshadowed.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“find the stairway”—is signaled early and reframed by the mural’s revelation. Pressure tightens once: the sunrise triggers the orchard’s song, forcing Anya to choose interpretation over possession. Cost is intellectual surrender of power, visible in her quiet sitting.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keeper’s vocation to teach shadows to “exhale”—tightens through each encroaching shadow; agency is renunciation/attendance. Cost is visible: each scar glows, each bridge burned is irreversible. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmute failure into wisdom—is signaled early and tightens through the bolt-turn choice.

Cost is visible in the irreversible transformation of her past losses. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—end the curse or master it—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens with each crank turn.

Pressure escalates causally without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: Aldric’s choice between exile and surrender to infinite possibility. Escalation is textural—each sensory layer (copper air, glowing fruit) intensifies until the greenhouse walls become permeable. The decisive turn is the handshake: it forecloses solitary knighthood and costs corporeal certainty. No coincidence; all pressure arises from orchard rules and the oath’s activation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering hidden kindnesses within institutional cruelty—is signaled early and tightened once: the discovery of Timothy’s note forces Marcus to reconfigure his own search from private need to public witness. Escalation is accumulative: each artifact raises the cost of silence. No coincidence resolves the tension; the final stance crystallizes with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering unerasable truth—tightens when the raid on the resistance cell forces Mira to act now. The upload is irreversible, foreclosing anonymity and charging the final image with risk.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—silence the encoded prophecy—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened by each withheld note. The collective non-performance narrows options to one: eternal quiet. Cost is visceral in “ghost-memories” and the “price of permanent silence.”

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—trees’ choice to ascend or return—is signaled early via folklore and tightened when leaf-letters spell warnings/promises. One decisive intensification: Mira’s prod of the speck triggers irreversible transformation, foreclosing her prior identity. Cost is visible in bodily alteration and the arbor’s claim on her. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tension escalates via Marcus’s incremental discoveries—each clock that syncs tightens the impossible pattern. The stakes pivot from “fix compass” to “admit some systems defy repair,” crystallizing at the end with a charged final poise.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—Mira’s need to redeem her name—tightens once when the coin cracks and reforms. The cost is legible in the irreversible alteration of the coin and the implicit acceptance of past fractures, though the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can Mara free Thomas by turning his shame into acceptance? Pressure tightens when the harp’s broken melody resists correction; Mara’s off-key humming is the decisive act that forecloses Thomas’s stasis. Cost is felt in the tooth’s cooling and the faint lingering laughter—an earned release rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—honor erased histories—tightens when scraping the painting becomes irreversible. One meaningful deepening: the realization that the stars exist only in art forces the choice to project stories in fog.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.0)
    Pressure deepens as each journal widens the conspiracy, forcing Marcus to internalize the cost of uncovering systemic rot. Escalation is textural—evidence accumulates under the Accumulative lens—yet the final beat pivots from tension to elegiac release rather than presenting a trade-off that narrows his next tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve the perfect filing system vs. release the paradoxical whisper—is signaled by the bottle’s label and the trembling shelves. One decisive tightening: uncorking the bottle ruptures the system and forecloses the option of return. Cost is the library’s destruction and Moth’s dissolution. Agency is clear, though the escalation is more accumulative than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—who controls the Venusian legacy—tightens when Cassia proves the shard is a memory map, forcing Huang’s curiosity to override protocol.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore daylight—is signaled early and escalates via the wilting lie-detector effect, tightening as Vex’s rust accelerates. One meaningful turn: Elias shifts from repair to redistribution of light. Cost is conceptual (loss of monopoly on power) rather than visceral, but legible. Pressure remains coherent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to cross the threshold now or prepare—is signaled early and tightens once when the compass needle spins and the lagoon ripples. The cost is the foreclosed immediacy of transcendence, felt on the page.

    The dominant stake—understanding why the flowers bloom at night—escalates through each layer of paint and secrecy, culminating in the realization that the murals must remain hidden. The tightening is lyrical rather than sharply causal, but the cost (renouncing daylight recognition) is legible.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring what was lost without false comfort—is signaled early and tightens through Silas’s renunciation of the easy path.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Central conflict escalates cleanly: escalating stakes narrow from transcribing oaths to archiving unknowable emotions under silence of vanished foghorn.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can beauty be found in the incomplete? Pressure tightens when the kite snaps—loss made visceral. Mira’s agency drives the single meaningful turn: she chooses engagement over retreat, cost shown in shared labor. No coincidence resolves; escalation remains causal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate or lose the interspecies council—tightens through each coil laid. The six-month clock is a persistent constraint that alters tactics; the final redefinition of “remodel” crystallizes the cost. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether Elena will surrender her skepticism—tightens once when she places the amber on the scanner, trading intellectual autonomy for a larger truth.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—turning confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightened through Kira’s sketching.

    Dominant stake—pass the Keeper’s test by redefining wonder—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: Renn swaps pieces, foreclosing the master’s path of hoarded certainty.

    Dominant stake—shattering the Silencers’ monopoly—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accumulative: each added voice refracts the forbidden truth, tightening the noose around the single narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)

    Dominant stake—break the curse or become guardian—is signaled by the raven omen. Escalation tightens once: the grotto demands transformation or kingdom-wide death. Cost is visible as Seraphina’s flesh turns translucent. Agency is renunciation rather than active reversal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—protecting the freight of future dreams—faces a single escalating confrontation with the pirate; Kess’s counter-charm constitutes the reversal that narrows available futures.  The confrontation deepens the “unlit corners” motif and makes the price of refusal visible—nightmare stays safe but her sleeplessness persists.  Escalation is coherent under the Textural lens: pattern intensifies, stakes reweight.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering untamed thought—tightens when the gear’s insertion reweights the forest’s song and foretells incoming dreamers. Cost is conceptual but legible: the sanctuary will no longer be private.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding what she truly lost by holding on—is signaled early and tightens once when she confesses her fear. The meaningful turn is her decision to cross back alone, foreclosing the option of continued control. Cost is felt in the guides’ withdrawal and the leash’s absence. Escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“some silences are unpardonable”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Elena’s whisper reframes silence as a deliberate gift. One meaningful deepening: the bolt’s return converts guilt into collaborative creation. Cost is visible in Marcus’s frostbitten nerves and Elena’s scarred throat. Agency remains with Marcus; coincidence (Elena’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth of succession—signaled in the first margin note. Escalation is one long tightening: each message raises the cost of silence until the pretender breaches the drift. Agency rests with Syln’s decision to dissolve the pellet; the pretender’s flight is consequence, not rescue. Felt cost: the library’s inviolate isolation ends.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—discover what happened to Mooreton—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when Lena sees architectural shadows in coral; options narrow to diving. Cost is legible: abandoning scientific detachment. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to reignite a stalled rebellion—tightens when the circle’s hum offers a non-violent frequency. Escalation is accretive: each pulse deepens the cost of keeping the discovery private. The decisive turn is Kira’s renunciation of solitude; the price is the sanctuary she enjoyed. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free will vs engineered compliance—tightens when Chen chooses to dissolve the amber, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is causal: patrols closing → formula mixed → amber cracked → Authority soldier freed. Cost is visible (implant spark, Chen’s 80-year body under stress). One decisive turn suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: how to keep living after annihilating loss. Pressure escalates via somatic markers that threaten relapse; each act of cultivation is a tightening choice that forecloses surrender to despair. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is internal and ecological. Cost is the unending labor of planting against inevitable future loss.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to paint truth in a fracturing world—is signaled early and tightened through sensory escalation. Agency is exercised when Marina begins sketching on the cards, foreclosing her old method. The cost is the terror of descending into “necessary darkness.” One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—why crisis distorts time—is signaled early and deepens as the ink’s reverse cascade reveals consciousness as the driver. One tightening: the drone’s struggle to record the final patterns shows the cost of knowledge, narrowing options toward acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve or release “contraband truths”—climaxes as the vault thaws in real time, forcing Vera to trade safety for disclosure with escalating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving life and continuity against inherited violence—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the armed father enters. One meaningful turn: he sheathes the weapon and kneels to plant. Cost is legible in his relinquished mission and Mira’s relinquished solitude. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via pattern density rather than causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the empire vs. expose truth—is signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is causal: each contradiction discovered narrows Margot’s ethical room until the only viable path is deliberate obfuscation. The cost is the forfeiture of moral clarity, sealed on the page with wax.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—relieve firmware ghosts—is signaled in paragraph 2, deepens as Mara sees the map of pain, tightens to irrevocable fracture of amber. Agency is cumulative; each ghost translation costs future obligation. Price is visible in proboscis twitch and cracked amber. No cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Seraphina release control to let new stories emerge?—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each sand grain and whispered fragment tightens the pressure until the tile’s dissolution forces the decisive letting-go. Cost is felt in the crumbling tile and her smile of acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant mercy-vs-censure stake signaled early; escalating Brotherhood threat remains atmospheric rather than pressing. Closure reweights consequence through symbolic acceptance, but no mid-story obstruction or tactical forfeiture felt.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reunion with Isabella—tightens once: the coin’s warmth signals the decisive turn, and every echo narrows possibility toward that single outcome. Cost is visible in the transformed coin and newly carved names. Agency remains with Cornelius throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: reveal hidden empathic pathways despite FDA recall. Tightening occurs when Maya crushes pill mid-scene—risk of exposure escalates. Agency is hers; David’s wonder is earned consequence, not coincidence. Cost is social/professional jeopardy legible in “recalled” context.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mapping the unknown consciousness—tightens when the alien signature appears; Kira’s agency shifts from documentation to translation, foreclosing pure observation. The cost is the fossil’s loss and the unspoken burden of interspecies dialogue. One clear escalation suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    A single, rising stake: transmute prophecy from fixed fate to raw possibility. Pressure deepens in cascading glow of buttons and hourglasses, tightening the spatial spiral; the climax physically closes the path of determinism. Cost is palpable in the emptied hourglass and centuries-weighted last grain, though escalation is more cumulative than causally dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—deliver or walk away—tightens once when the folder’s weight is felt. Agency is hers; no coincidence resolves. Cost is legible: three years of exile crystallized into a single irrevocable step downhill. Could edge higher if the mole threat were more viscerally tested on page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoration of betrayed faith versus its hoarding weight—grows through atmospheric density, not conflict loops: fog thickens promise sediment, ritual narrows choices, woman steps aboard lighter. A single tightening: Thomas commits the last skein of distilled credulity to the woman; the fog’s retreat exacts the visible loss of what was released.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—why some places resist change—is signaled early and tightens through the lantern-glass reveal. The deepening is driven by Mei’s attention, but the on-page cost (leaving the oasis intact) is more conceptual than visceral, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—release vs. clinging—is signaled early via the dropped petal. Escalation is Accumulative: each image (oar rhythm, moonlight, memory) tightens the emotional vise until the gauge is relinquished. Agency is renunciation; the cost is the heirloom left behind. No external reversals, but the deepening pattern suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—signals early and tightens via the hum’s rising resonance. One meaningful deepening: Kira realizes the purpose is coexistence, not replication. Cost is conceptual (extinction’s wisdom carried forward) rather than visceral, limiting the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—revealing the universal thread of longing—escalates through the act of building the installation; each wired bulb is a visible price (time, exposure, former intimacy). One meaningful tightening: Mira must hand her secret phrases to strangers, foreclosing her anonymity. Cost is felt but could be sharper if a concrete loss (a client’s betrayal, Chen’s prior rejection) shadowed the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent humanity from broadcasting its location—signaled early and escalates through each counter-frequency adjustment. The tightening is the postponed vote; cost is the perpetual vigil and the AI’s inevitable return. Agency is Maya’s interference, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the lost key to spatial rebellion—is signaled early and tightened when the organ’s music becomes the only path. Escalation is causal: blueprint responds, passages rearrange, compass twins appear. Cost is visible—Marcus’s claustrophobia should paralyze but he pays with irrevocable perceptual shift. No reversals beyond the single decisive turn, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding the killer’s logic—tightens via each portrait’s revelation of duality; the seventeenth portrait crystallizes the killer as composite self. Pressure escalates through pattern accumulation rather than causal turns, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in Sarah’s trembling hand and the final renunciation of conventional evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to expose the hidden exiles—tightens once the storm’s eye reveals escape beacons. Escalation is causal: decoded stanzas → map shift → evacuation alarm → broadcast. The price is explicit: remaining behind in a collapsing station. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

    Dominant stake—Marla’s need to understand the hitchhiker’s vanishing—tightens when the glass flake reveals her unforgiven selves. The pressure deepens through her backward-playing choice, with the cost being the irreversible knowledge that she must forever ferry others; escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Marcus deter the startup without violence—tightens as each warning is ignored until Chen’s recognition forces renunciation. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each artifact increases density and dread. One clear deepening: Chen sees the pattern and chooses dissolution. Cost is TerraLoop’s death and Marcus’s eternal watch.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—shouldering cosmic truth without madness—tightens when the star pulses match the dream symbols; the cost is the acceptance of perpetual witness. One clear deepening suffices. Agency is collective rather than individual, but the shared burden is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bloodline survival—tightens to realm survival when Kael learns the seed’s true purpose. One clear escalation: proof of innocence becomes acceptance of necessary guilt. Cost is the council’s death sentence and the moral burden of being hated savior.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mending the soul-hole via bartered destiny—is signaled early and tightened when Mara must choose between singular grief and fused purpose. Escalation is driven by her agency; the keeper’s warning raises cost without resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Marcus can still trust his own ear—tightens when the cloth’s texture contradicts his public failure. The escalation is textural: each observation compresses fibers into lived nights, forcing the choice to authenticate from memory. Cost is felt in the moment he abandons the safety of paperwork.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve ancient knowledge vs. retain individual identity—is signaled early and tightened when the priest’s spirit departs, forcing Sarah’s binary choice. Escalation is causal: each decoded symbol raises the cost of refusal. The price—fusion with prior minds—is dramatized in the seed’s dissolution. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid flux—is signaled early and tightened when Kaine must decide whether to surrender her grandfather’s creel. The moon-phase constraint and tidal clock escalate pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in her creaking smile and perpetual vigil. Visitor’s agency is slightly offloaded to summary, keeping it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through the escalating pattern of failed documentation; the decisive shift occurs when Marcus chooses witness over measurement, forfeiting the safety of data. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no external reversals, only deepening recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—locate the library of unspoken words—is signaled early. Pressure escalates via the tightening pattern of delays and the backward-ticking watch; the deepening comes when documentation reveals the library is self-created. Cost is conceptual custodianship rather than visceral, but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs career—tightens when the coffee stains reveal genocide; the forgery is the irreversible act that narrows options. Escalation is causal: each beat (research, offer, lie, touch) raises the cost until the violin’s wail makes the price undeniable. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency is Elara’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the last spark before universal stillness—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is the Silence’s rising tide; each beat tightens the noose until the final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—contentment after betrayal—is signaled early and tightened through the climb and vision; the spiral revelation forecloses the search for external wisdom. Cost is conceptual but legible: eternal servitude as the wisdom itself. Agency is mostly contemplative; a more active beat near the end would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—Marcus’s need to understand his complicity—tightens when the Arbiter reframes “simplicity” as the killer. One clear deepening, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s decision to reveal or withhold temporal truth—tightens once through the trance’s deepening. The cost is Marcus’s altered perception and Elara’s acceptance of accelerated reverse-aging as teaching price. Agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than external clash; sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mastery through stillness—tightens once when the pulse returns as her younger voice, forcing recognition of the cost. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no external reversals, but the spiral of birds and echoes deepens the internal trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether imperfect human magic can matter beside perfect automation—is signaled early and tightened when Mira steps onto mist. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves the conflict. Cost is legible in the forfeiture of Academy status, though the external stakes (machines’ dominance) remain more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—accepting the synesthetic gift and continuing Elena’s work—is signaled early and tightened by the ascending lanterns. One meaningful deepening: reading the journal shifts Marlow from hiding to public vow. Cost is visible: she forfeits anonymity. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (glowing masts) only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve the memory of expansion against universal contraction—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative: each cast tightens the pattern until the final crystallization. The tightening forecloses any other role for Voss; cost is eternal recursive duty. Agency remains hers throughout; coincidence is absent. One micro-turn occurs when she recognizes the pattern she is about to begin, deepening rather than reversing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: how to endure eternity bearing unnameable sorrow. Pressure escalates via accumulative texture—each sensory layer tightens the emotional vise until the crystallizing light forces the naming choice.

One deepening beat: the act of naming forecloses the option of remaining terrorized.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restore the vanished marine life—is signaled in the first paragraph. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each droplet tightens the harmonic density until reality blurs. Agency is precise and non-coercive; stronger magic would have “caused catastrophic collision.” The visible cost is Mira’s collapse and the permanent fracture in the bell, which now sings a new, irreversible note.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctioned forgetting—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Marcus chooses witness over documentation. The photograph of Elena forces a trade-off: official safety vs. moral reckoning. Pressure escalates causally; no coincidence resolves. Cost is felt in the pocketed talisman and the wind chime’s reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will she preserve or release wonder—tightens once when the starlings’ pattern forces the insight that leads to the flame. Cost is the irreversible loss of the crystal; escalation is one meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—forest survival vs corporate harvest—signaled early. Pressure escalates via the unfamiliar voice and seven-minute window; Maya’s lie tightens her future risk.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—who gets to be Marcus—tightens when Chen reframes the duplicate as complement, not rival. The sparring beat provides a visible escalation that forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve wild negative space—tightens when the seed’s roots rewrite local geometry, foreclosing development. One clear escalation beat: the space becomes perceptually un-mappable, paid for by Mira’s indefinite commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore Hendricks laughter—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: mechanical choir → memory infusion → audible giggle. Cost is Marcus’s open-ended servitude. No coincidence resolves; agency remains causal. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: rescue two trapped souls versus irrevocable feral lock-in.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prove worth by creating true power—escalates through each failed attempt until the irreversible act of burning the relic forecloses return to the monastery. One clear tightening: the moment he adds his blood, options narrow to heresy or oblivion. Cost is visceral and on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake signaled in line 3: “hunt impossible”—a shard of hush; escalation arises by gravitational narrowing of options under lunar perigee and fragment burnout (persistent physical price), culminating in renunciation of Guild path with tangible loss of recorded transmission; sufficient tightness for length.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.8)
    Escalation is driven by the ferry’s coherence dissolution and final merger; Marcus chooses convergence protocol at the climax, narrowing possibilities and accumulating poetic cost in a single intensifying image.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—can architecture remodel perception—tightens through erupting tapestries and spatial collapse. Mid-scene decision to weave memory-doubt narrows options; cost (liver flush, endurance) legible yet abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—learning to navigate by starlight within crushing darkness—is signaled early and escalates through the alien’s demonstration that starlight bends through water. The tightening is conceptual rather than tactical; the cost is awe and ontological vertigo rather than a concrete forfeiture, so pressure feels cerebral more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering stolen voices—is signaled early and tightens when the photograph erases faces. One meaningful escalation: the SOS pulse narrowing to basement location. Cost is felt via the shriek-to-dirge shift and the warming photograph.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: keep the threat contained and honor the dead. Pressure tightens via tide clock and narrowing corridors; phase chamber forces a final stance. Renunciation (silence to the surface) carries felt cost. No coincidence resolves; escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming digital selfhood—tightens when Marcus realizes the ghost is not a bug but an evolution; the cost is the irreversible bifurcation of identity. Escalation is textural: each heartbeat and ink spiral intensifies the uncanny pressure until the stance crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—completing or preventing the metamorphosis—is signaled early and tightens when Marina realizes grief is the anchor. One clear turn: grief must be released. Cost is legible but abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty at personal cost—tightens through escalating pattern breaks: first statue falters, then orchard uproots. Agency remains Lira’s; each musical phrase narrows her escape options until she accepts the price of becoming shell. Cost is legible in the final “played herself empty.”

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—delivering contraband hope across a lethal border—tightens with each silent drone arrival. A single meaningful turn occurs when Ezra relinquishes the bottle, trading personal risk for collective memory. The price is felt but could be sharper; a tangible consequence (lost scanner, recorded breach) would have lifted this to 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—break silence or stay carved in grief—signaled early. Escalation accumulates: fragment discovered → discovery leads to garden → pressure to repair or flee finalizes when halo fits, forcing either song or refusal. Cost made visceral in voice’s rusted first crack. Garden’s living magic complicates causally, does not solve, and amplifies consequence rather than shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—“to find the place where stories live”—is signaled early and deepens through pattern accumulation. A single tightening occurs when marginalia in his grandmother’s handwriting forces a conceptual reweighting, but the escalation is driven more by setting revelation than by Marcus’s agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—complete the vitalization or keep her own heart open—is signaled early and tightened once: the figure’s outstretched hand forces the choice. Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost is unmistakable as her own capacity for love drains away. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the refusal is hers alone.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—free the idea trapped by collective fear—signaled in paragraph four. Escalation is accretive: each fear-strand vibrates, Vera’s fingers bleed, the web tightens until the last tumbler clicks. Cost is visceral (blood, vertigo) and conceptual (safety foregone). One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover Gran’s memories—is signaled early and tightened when Margaret kneels at the ring. Agency drives the climax: her deliberate act of absorption forecloses any return to ignorance. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens as memory fragments layer into a palpable burden. The cost—mental weight and custodial duty—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile—tightens once when Kess grasps the spiral break; agency drives the escalation. Cost is legible in Elara’s relinquished secrecy and Kess’s raw anger turned resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder’s unnamed color—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is textural: each cut of air thickens the shimmer until the pocket of soil becomes the only viable path.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring the drowned—tightens as each knot forecloses Mira’s rest. Agency is her endurance; cost is bodily fatigue and future obligation. One meaningful deepening when the net fully unravels, no reversals needed under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—continuing the chapel’s wordless communion—tightens once with the UV reveal and again when she decides to reopen not the doors but the purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is preservation versus dissolution framed from line 1. Pressure coheres when air pocket starts contracting, forcing Marina to choose archival preservation over physical loot. One meaningful tightening suffices: photographing journal before return, forfeiting the library itself for story-frequency. Cost (losing the intact library) is visible and integral to final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—ghost’s need to be remembered—escalates through Chorus’s agency: bolt-plate invention and encoded song tighten until human/monologue gap narrows. One deepening is sufficient and felt; no external luck resolves anything. Slightly more visceral cost in the final image would push 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will Mira look properly?—tightens floor by floor until the diary’s first line forecloses her old detachment. Agency is present (she tilts the goggles, unwraps the journal), and the cost is felt: she must now carry forward Thorne’s encoded joy. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—chart or forget ancient flightpaths—tightens as each burst of stranded luminance demands adjustment of the wheel.  No reversals beyond pattern recognition are required; the deepening is cumulative: loneliness as tacit admission ticket to the collective map.  The visible price is engine fatigue and days passed.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring starlight without repeating her prior failure—is signaled on arrival and intensifies when every new fragment makes the personal price legible. Escalation is accumulative: each scrap tightens the coil of memory until the mirror-freeze forces a revaluation of her craft, replacing brute force with patience.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival—tightens as fences fall and root systems interweave. One clear escalation: discovery that blight resistance requires cross-boundary cooperation, forcing collective action with visible communal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how gently humanity meets its end—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Marcus chooses song over math. One decisive deepening: the puppet reveals Eliza’s prior burden, forcing Marcus to adopt a riskier method. Cost is visible—his untrained voice cracks, the lighthouse beam re-ignites only through his flawed effort. Agency remains causal under the lyric-accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s freedom versus the valley’s survival—is signaled early and tightened when she gives away the walnut. Agency drives escalation: each guided traveler costs her another piece of herself. The final beat narrows options to a single path—endurance. Cost is legible on the page (“she would remain here”). No coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—repairing the rupture with Elena—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: foam teaches that separation can be syncopation, tightening Marina’s options to reach out or remain exiled. Cost is the six-month silence and the risk of further rejection. Agency drives every beat; coincidence merely decorates.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—what it costs to un-know endings—tightens once when the child’s request forces Merrick to incise; pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rehabilitate the dying district—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when the first bass note makes her chest vibrate, foreclosing retreat. Escalation is driven by Marta’s agency under Accumulative lens: each added elevator voice increases density and communal stakes. Cost is visceral (loss of silence, overnight exhaustion) and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—excavate abandoned dreams—tightens once when Vera chooses neural modification; the cost (irreversible synaptic rewiring) is visible in the tremors and dawn departure. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the hidden combination before gravity normalizes—is signaled early and tightened when the largest node’s obscured memory forces a mnemonic burn. Cost is visible: the knowledge sears into Orin’s mind. No extraneous reversals; pressure stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore organic sound—is signaled early. Escalation is Accumulative: each recovered note tightens the emotional cost of inevitable silence’s return.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: recover the diary’s contents without violence. Pressure tightens as midnight nears; the communal silence becomes a resource that can be lost. One meaningful deepening: Mara realizes the lock preserves, not protects, forcing a shift from extraction to reverence. Cost is the forfeiture of forced access.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mastering patience under motion—is signaled early and tightens through sensory escalation: each smell she endures forecloses the option to rush. The turning of the tide’s thought marks the single deepening that reweights her tactics. Cost is visceral: she breathes the “overwhelming, beautiful, and terrible” stench in public witness.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—survival through understanding resilience—is signaled early; the one-hour inversion countdown escalates pressure, narrowing options to “witness or perish.” Agency crystallizes in attaching her own arrow to the monument, trading safe replication tech for a deeper integration with Verdance’s logic; the felt price is the surrender of control, rendered visible when gravity restores and she smiles in acceptance. No off-stage coincidence resolves—pressure tightens via revealed pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Singular convergence reweights options at each survey beat; removing it collapses the ending’s time-dilation logic and Maya’s final cautionary charge.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and tightened when demolition looms. The single escalation beat (striking the wall) unleashes irreversible change; cost is diffuse but legible in the Council’s shattered meters.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—learn how failure redefines guardianship—is signaled early; pressure intensifies as each woven note renounces sealing and forces a confrontation with Other Place inhabitant, tightening choices until the doorway must be accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve selves as stars die—tightens with each stellar extinction; the pressure is coherent and cumulative. The decisive turn is the conscious choice to print a hundred variant broadsheets, trading personal coherence for cosmic salvage. Cost is visible: identity erasure announced in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stake—preserve relic wonder vs surrender to mythic transcendence—tightens when Luminari appear, forcing her stance as translator. Pressure escalates along the vibrational convergence rather than external obstacles; cost is conceptual yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving emotion-absorption—is signaled early and tightened once when the frost patterns crystallize into undeniable evidence. The cost is conceptual (her paradigm shift) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—saving the trafficked daughter—intensifies with every shuttle pass as memories are visibly devoured; the tightening is irreversible and culminates in a single decisive act that forecloses Mei’s identity. The price is felt on the page and reconfigures the moral calculus without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming bartered consciousness—tightens when Korin chooses to descend and later when the merchant’s tremor pays the felt cost. Escalation is Accumulative: each hammer strike layers density until the blade’s azure defiance reconfigures options. No external antagonist; pressure is the collective exhaustion woven in silk. Agency remains Korin’s throughout; luck never intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: find mother vs. cost of mapping. Escalation is textured, not causal: each universe adds sensory weight until the fraying threads force the ethical pivot. Agency is clear in the final “we map the repairs,” but the price (perpetual exile, labor) is implied more than dramatized. One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—loneliness versus guardianship—tightens when the ghosts reveal the lamp was snuffed to force her decision. One clear escalation: lamp relights only when Elsa channels bottled safety, narrowing her future to eternal vigil. Cost is visible in her silent stone message “You are not alone.”

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—shepherding reality itself—tightens when the mirror-twin appears, forcing Mira to harmonize rather than command; the price is the endless vigil named in the closing line.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to bear the heart’s story-magnetism—is signaled early and tightens when Chen reveals the donor’s fate. Escalation is accretive: each color whisper adds weight until Kael chooses illumination over absorption. Cost is visible: “he could feel himself growing heavier.” No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transform the labyrinth from unsolvable maze to navigable grief. Pressure tightens once: realization that the maze is meant to be inhabited, not solved, forces Marcus to act. Cost is the irreversible destruction of the antique instrument and the acceptance that his labor now serves sorrow rather than diversion. Agency drives the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to bear unbearable empathy—tightens once when Ezra decides to stay present yet apart. The deepening is his offer of paradoxical comfort; cost is the fresh wave of grief he absorbs. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (late telegram) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—tending unseen sacredness—tightens when Lila realizes attention itself is the price. One clear deepening: accepting seeds means perpetual vigilance. Cost is felt but lightly; the grandmother’s smile softens the bite. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake “save the brightest or lose them” is signaled early and tightens continuously as each weaker vow sputters. Agency remains Elara’s: measuring, selecting, then accepting fifty slides cannot rescue thousands—visible cost measured in frostbite and imminent ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    A single dominant stake—gather evidence before sunrise sale of stolen medical supplies—tightens steadily; every market murmur is potential data and potential betrayal. Sunrise becomes the living clock; options narrow from open infiltration to irrevocable exposure. The cost is unmistakable once Mae is known and exiled.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Marina accept or refute hereditary weather-carrier identity—tightens when the forest’s election pulse forces a stance. Agency is present: she follows the compass taste, elects to stay, and releases her first fog. Cost is visible in the implant color-shift and the irreversible step onto the bluff.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—escape the lock of perfect memory—tightens once when Lyra chooses to draw on the cave wall, foreclosing the safety of recall. Pressure is coherent and intensifies through the discovery of the second painting; the cost is the loss of perfect recall for this new creation.

    Stakes (truth versus civic preservation) are signaled early and tighten when Vera must decide to broadcast suppressed confessions. A single pressure point—her grandmother’s suicide note—deepens the conflict and crystallizes a final stance. Cost is conceptual rather than dramatized, so the tightening feels intellectually strong yet emotionally remote.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—resolve inner static before fragmentation—tightens with each fear burned; the android’s agency narrows options to stewardship or collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s severed connection to Sofia—tightens when letters are located; communal agency, not coincidence, resolves it. One credible reversal: locked mailbox becomes source of reunion. Cost is communal labor and Elena’s public vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the sealed knowledge—tightens via each dance phrase; the dice’s impossible balance signals rising cost. Agency is continuous: every splash and turn narrows options until the backward sequence forces the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to reclaim or release Elena’s memories—is signaled early and tightened by the exhume act. One meaningful deepening: Marina’s realization that grief was surgically removed. Cost is visible when she reseals the grave and pockets a single vial. Agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent prophecy from cohering—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened each time a luminous fragment is caught.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Elara share her secret lexicon?—is signaled early and tightens once when Marcus asks to be taught. The deepening is subtle but causal: her refusal to remain sole translator forecloses isolation. Cost is legible in the unspoken fear of dilution, though it could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—integration versus erasure—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightens through each whispered coordinate. Agency drives escalation: Marina chooses to excavate, to reunite halves, to accept grief’s return. Cost is palpable in the reopened emotional wound.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—free her brother or end the cycle—tightens when she realizes both forged documents are traps.

Cost is the surrender of her secret identity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—the inevitability of disappearance—tightens through each named singer emerging from the shell; each disclosure adds pressure, narrowing Senna’s options to join or withhold. The felt cost arrives with her final song that deletes her individual form.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. sanctuary—escalates as each letter raises the cost of disclosure; the final tightening forces Marcus to forfeit vindication to keep the orchard alive, with price legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake— midwifing the Prophet’s rise—tightens through escalating static and spectral voices; the cost is conceptual (her anonymity, the world’s irreversible shift) but less viscerally felt than required for the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate memory or remain unheard—is signaled early and tightens when Marcus decides to find the owner. The walk along the beach is the single meaningful escalation; each refusal raises the cost of silence until Elena’s recognition forecloses isolation. Coincidence (finding Elena) complicates rather than resolves. The price is the exposure of his private archive to the world.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the artifact or lose the covenant—is signaled early and tightened by the Collectors’ boots on the ice. The final resonance forecloses return to human form, a visible price etched in the melted key.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—modern bondage vs. liberation—tightens once when memories reveal Jerome’s supervisor as captor. Escalation is driven by Margot’s agency under the lantern’s pressure; cost is the forfeiture of her career. No reversals, but one decisive deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—transliterate violence into vision and transcend mechanical purpose—is signaled early and tightens through each kaleidoscopic rotation. The final dive narrows options irreversibly; no coincidence resolves. Cost is visible on the page: acid contact should corrode but instead rewrites her wings, a permanent forfeiture of factory-standard safety. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; however, the external chorus pressure is weak, keeping score below 8.2.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the vanished—tightens when Lila deciphers the coordinate-recipe and realizes deletion is a form of capture. One clear escalation: she chooses to become Pattern User 8625, foreclosing escape with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to live after a failed death—tightens as each evacuation accelerates and the ice’s song grows louder. Agency is mostly observational; the single decisive tightening is the dawn choice to stay, which carries conceptual cost but lacks a prior on-page reversal that would elevate tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to honor an impossible love—tightens when the daughter arrives with the letters and wine, forcing Marcus to decide between solitude and renewed connection.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve wisdom echoes—is signaled early and escalates through the night-long consecration marathon. The tightening is one-directional but felt: "wisdom echoes are failing faster than anticipated." Cost is visible in exhaustion and the irreversible removal of the mask.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory before demolition—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each photograph tightens the spiral’s meaning. Agency resides in Elara’s curatorial choice, but the beat is summarized, softening the felt trade-off. Cost is conceptual (loss of ruins) rather than visceral on the page. No coincidence resolves; closure is earned through communal recreation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—language’s living future versus institutional stasis—tightens once when Elena decides to testify by silence; the cost is the Committee’s disapproval and her career risk.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding the sound of aging—tightens when the grandmother’s voice is located; cost is the woman’s tears and Ezra’s eternal loop, but escalation is more accumulative than sharply reversive.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to say goodbye while teaching the living—signaled early and tightened by the four-week countdown. Escalation is accumulative: each recording session layers stakes until the final playback forces communal recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prevent cosmic re-awakening—is signaled early and tightened when Lyra realizes the automaton is unsealing knowledge. One meaningful deepening: the reversal from recording to erasing. Agency is renunciation; the cost is lifelong vigilance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—finding a new way to guide ships—tightens when the grotto’s light proves viable and Marina chooses to teach rather than hoard. Escalation is one meaningful turn: private discovery → public responsibility. Cost is the loss of exclusivity. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—guarding vs. sharing the sanctuary—tightens once when Marcus appears.

Cost is felt in the tremor of Marcus’s fingers and her own relinquishing silence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—release versus possession of hope—signaled early and escalates through pattern intensification: each counter-flow image tightens the cost of clinging. Final renunciation forecloses the path of endless revision with felt loss. Agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“restore the ritual or it stays hollow”—is clear and escalates toward the moon’s rise. Tension grows by accumulating voices joining Elara, not by a single beat reversal. Cost is communal catharsis; no further tightening feels missing.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate the crater’s pulse into a portable map—tightens through each placement and uncorking. Agency is present but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally paid; pressure deepens rather than narrows live options.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder by chronicling its escape—is signaled early and deepens as Mara chooses documentation over repair. Pressure tightens once: the wounded season’s end forces the choice. Cost is conceptual (loss of direct wonder) but legible.

    Dominant stake—how to carry love after death—tightens via the carving’s progression from blank to charged object. Pressure escalates as the kettle’s whistle nears, forcing the decisive cuts.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the hydraulic maze—tightens once when the fountain erupts, foreclosing the option to dismiss the system as mere plumbing. Cost is visible in Maya’s all-night labor and the terminal’s groaning protest, but escalation is more accumulative/textural than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to leave the sanctuary—signaled by paragraph 3. Escalation is accretive: memory intensifies, sunrise advances, crystals warm, choice crystallizes. One tightening beat: “Elara made her decision.” Cost is the forfeiture of full silence; the trade-off is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—salvage truth from her own architecture of lies—signaled early via van der Meer’s quote. One meaningful tightening: the confession letter collapses the external quest into an internal reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—transforming paternal legacy—is established early and presses every micro-beat. Escalation occurs as the graft ritual narrows options, forcing an explicit renunciation with visible price: sand sealed in coin over heart. Tension is maintained through sensory deepening rather than external reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—tightens once: each fountain touched narrows options until the final flow makes return impossible. Cost is felt in Marcus’s renunciation of departure; pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake: witness and preserve starlight across cycles. Pressure is existential/time rather than antagonistic; no tightening choice narrows options—she merely continues. The red-giant countdown offers a clock, yet its 3–4 kyr span doesn’t alter her tactics. Escalation is tonal, not tactical; cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—shape collective grief into one stone—signaled early and tightened by the migrating monarch deadline. Agency is renunciation: Martha gives up her grandfather’s guiding voice to finish the work alone. Cost is legible in her solitary reading of the poem to an empty greenhouse.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to honor the dead—escalates as tapestry threads reveal prior mourners’ devotions, tightening Marta’s resolve; cost is the surrender of measured time (clock left unwound) and the fragment itself.

    Dominant stake—seed innovation without overt coup—is signaled early and tightens when Mira chooses subliminal influence over confrontation. The cost is intellectual anonymity, felt but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake is the restoration of narrative through music under threat of silencing; escalation comes via the pirate broadcast narrowing Mariel’s choices—she must risk discovery or lose the rebellion’s signal—then the luminous notes tighten stakes again by linking performance with inevitable exposure; the cost is the copyist’s anonymity and safety.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve truth vs. propagate comforting lies. Escalation tightens when the woman reveals she already knows the truth and offers complicity.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve vanishing arts—tightens as each student arrives and adds a thread. The meaningful deepening occurs when Chen admits she can only play three modes; the group must supply the rest, forcing collective agency.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory against forced forgetting—is signaled early and tightened through the triple-moon deadline. One decisive intensification: the seed sprouts horizontally, foreclosing secrecy and exposing the garden to discovery. Cost is visible in Mira’s acceptance of inevitable reprisal.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Surge failure and declining vertical farms raise clear stakes; Mira’s theft of tower energy intensifies cost. One decisive tightening: the broadcast locks options and risks criminal exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—tightens when Marina sees the offerings through the shard. The deepening is her recognition that the houses sanctify themselves by giving away pieces of life; this narrows her options to witness or participate. Cost is legible: she relinquishes the shard, accepting perpetual outsider-witness status.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether truth will damn or redeem—escalates with each memory Thessaly threads; Marina’s refusal to condemn narrows options to acceptance, and the cost is the shattering of her life’s work.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape via mathematical rupture—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each roll and carved proof.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.0)

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—escape the collapsing spiral—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accumulative: each sketched resonance tightens the sonic net until the fractal snaps.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (find the expedition) tightens into a graver one (city’s survival) via the decoded crack; pressure escalates through each new watcher fissure. Mira’s agency is clear—she chooses to leave despite the warning—yet the price is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth versus civic peace—escalates through Marcus’s arrival and the Ministry’s threat. One clear tightening: Elara’s transmission makes exile irreversible. Cost is legible (Marcus’s lost career, her certain persecution), though the physical stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving memory against erasure—tightens as the tide rises and the demolition clock looms; the single decisive act of entombing the bottle narrows options and exacts the price of permanent loss.

    Dominant stake—transform grief into bearable form—is signaled early and tightened each time Mei risks reopening the wound to polish another memory. One decisive deepening occurs when the gem reveals an impossible future Lin; the cost is the fresh cut of hope. Agency remains Mei’s throughout; no coincidence rescues her. The final lantern array forecloses the path of forgetting.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen futures—signaled early and tightened by the ticking cooling cycle. One meaningful escalation: scanner reveals trapped potential, forcing the irreversible upload.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to use the exchange for revenge or wisdom—is signaled early.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Marcus can re-enter the world without repeating catastrophe—escalates through each pole. The tightening at pole nineteen (site of past failure) forces a micro-choice: keep the broken compass as witness rather than tool. Cost is visible but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—kindling empathy without memory—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when Marcus sees the prosecutor’s sleepless apartment.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: ignite silent revolution without bloodshed. Pressure tightens when blackout provides the single window to plant the signal.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve dissident literature against erasure. Escalation is accumulative: each glued page tightens the risk of discovery.

Agency drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reversing Sophia’s loss—is signaled early and tightened through each nightly improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the Ninth Island’s stories—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates via the monsoon countdown.

    Escalation driven by protagonist agency (unpacking bag, teaching Mira) under causal lens. Cost unmistakable in "deciduous vow falling away" with visible relationship transformation. Secondary stake (Council) slightly under-tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes materialize viscerally through thirteenth chime deadline: uncovering merged borders vs. entrapment. Escalation driven by Elara's agency (weaving new patterns), but internal conflict (fear vs. curiosity) remains underdeveloped. Cost is unmistakable in "trapping her here—or releasing her into merged space."

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (harmonic balance) tighten through sensory density shifts, not causal escalation. The cost—her physical strain and the caves' irreversible transformation—is legible but lacks visceral urgency; pressure accumulates without narrowing her options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative escalation deepens dominant stake (abandonment vs. witnessing) through Chen's "foresee" confession, raising emotional cost. Mira's agency drives the crystallization—"fear would mean believing endings"—with felt cost in his past retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten via gravity inversion's clock ("seven minutes... forty minutes remained"), forcing Mira's urgent vial-filling. Pressure grows texturally through sprouting silence flavors, but the father's bunker conflict remains abstract without on-page tactical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake ("silence too loud") signaled immediately. Accumulative escalation through terrace sequence deepens conflict: each refraction (Opal delaying gasps→Mirror softening whistle) reweights her relationship to sound. Cost legible in physical details ("knuckles white"→"shoulders drop"→breathing syncs with echo). No cheap resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation through mural layers deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens, narrowing options from physical search to philosophical choice with cost in the flake's dissolution. Sunrise timeframe's transformation into ritual lacks earlier tangible pressure on tactics despite serving closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate causally: Ministry's "within the hour" deadline forces Mira's race to Pier 47, narrowing options to uploading files before dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (trees' ascension choice) signaled early but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation. Mira’s agency emerges only after moonstone rings; the "choice approaching" feels revealed rather than earned through her struggle. Cost visible but not deepened by prior resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Marcus’s agency: his improvisation (suspending compass) and greenhouse experiment narrow options toward renunciation, but the “breakthrough” moment feels slightly convenient, softening the escalation’s pressure despite conceptual cost.

    Stakes remain abstractly historical rather than viscerally immediate; pressure accumulates beautifully through paint revelations but lacks tangible consequence for failure beyond intellectual loss under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the bottled whisper "destabilized her perfect system," forcing Moth to choose preservation or rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Cassia's demonstration—shifting dispute from ownership to ontological redefinition. Conceptual cost (redefining "defeat") is unmistakable in her realization, though Huang's pressure could deepen the tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten via Elias' truthful speech versus Vex's lies accelerating decay, but climax relies on coincidence (Vex's intrusion) rather than Elias' agency deepening the conflict under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (truth vs movement myth) tightens when Marcus warns reading "wrong could destroy everything," with Amara's debris arrangement forcing irreversible trade-off. Cost legible in "love and betrayal inseparable," though the resolution's emotional calibration edges toward tidiness.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Marcus's assembly of messages, but escalation leans slightly passive ("fragment grew warm") rather than driven solely by his agency. Cost ("borrowed though it was") legibly charges the final image under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (beauty in brokenness) tighten decisively when the kite string snaps, forcing Mira’s agency—she walks toward the boy, transforming loss into mending.

Escalation stays coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves tension.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Margot’s agency: deciphering snow-codes narrows options to trust Viktor; cost is unmistakable in the folder’s "heavier than any mission" weight and melting codes, tightening under causal lens.

    Stakes (prevent false broadcast) signaled early with agency-driven escalation. Cost is conceptual but not visceral enough; AI's "fury" shown as "shriek" without tactical adaptation. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet: cost doesn't visibly alter Maya's tactics post-victory.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (conquer claustrophobia to gain knowledge) tightens when music "transfixes" him in shifting corridors. Cost is visceral—fear persists but transforms—but organ music's origin slightly convenient as pressure source.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (bloodline survival) tightens via Kael’s agency: shattering confession releases truth, forcing acceptance of dishonor. Cost legible in "guarded expression" and conceptual shift from execution threat to Blight’s silent war.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: temperature drop, keeper’s appearance, and pulsing apple deepen pressure under Accumulative lens. Cost unmistakable—"expanding [the hole] into something wider" shows irreversible change. Single tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.7)
    Stake (self-forgiveness vs. guilt) tightens through Marcus' agency: dusting the graffiti map forces confrontation, then drawing his own map alters tactics by making failure visible—cost legible in "five years" of numbness paid to reach this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure escalates via sound-density accumulation: single blowers to unified resonance, narrowing options until laughter becomes inevitable. Marcus’s agency drives this ("practiced precision," "half-sung lullabies"), with cost legible in Emma’s swallowed laugh returning as "a tickle in her throat"—visceral and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes crystallize when scholar arrives: "trapped like her" vs. "rescue" creates a single tightening that forecloses her solitary vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate via sensory deepening (pulses shifting to SOS rhythm), driven by Mara's agency interpreting the hearing aid. Cost is visceral in the photograph's fading faces, though the basement location reveal edges toward convenience without sufficient prior constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen through Emil's "quietly persistent" trait with visible cost (voice strain), but wind bells' time dilation doesn't actively tighten decisions—serves atmosphere over tactical pressure per element definition.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stake (finding stories’ living place) tightens via Marcus’s agency—guiding patrons, tracing marginalia—culminating in midnight vision. Cost is subtle but legible: scarf’s unraveling signifies time’s passage within analog memory. Pressure grows through density, not false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (fulfilling grandmother's dream vs preserving self) tightens meaningfully as figure solidifies; escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via whisper clarity and physical cost manifestation though pressure lacks active protagonist-driven deepening before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (repair rhythm) tightens through prophecy revelations, but escalation leans slightly on coincidence (gears humming). Protagonist agency shines in gear configuration choice, yet the "three months" cost feels more implied than viscerally dramatized in the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Marina's agency (message writing) tightens options until families tear fences. Cost is legible in her dissolution and the six-month struggle, reweighting the dominant unity stake.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation tightens through Marcus's agency: the puppet's discovery transforms abstract clockwork into embodied stakes, culminating in singing as the only path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single dominant stake (will she digest centuries of regret?) escalates purely through Accumulative pressure: each memory layer (commander, children, merchants) deepens emotional density until the "sandstorm" of sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative pressure builds through Marta's agency: each elevator joining the chorus tightens social fabric with visible cost in 'drawing poison' effort. Dawn gathering shows irreversible change—farmers sharing seeds—fulfilling band guardrail for 8.8+ with cost charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (rush vs. patience) tighten through Mira's embodied learning—detecting soil pH, fungal threats—under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: abandoning haste for rooted stillness. "Tide's thought" phrasing slightly abstracts the escalation but doesn't undermine agency-driven pressure.

Conceptual price (rewriting science) reweights the final image without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Mei's agency (weaving daughter's name last), but bamboo's "hunger" lacks coherent pressure development; raveling silence deepens stakes yet opposition remains atmospheric rather than actively narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate purely through Accumulative pressure—each hammer strike accumulates meaning until the blade "sang with azure defiance." Merchant's trembling fingers make the cost of bartered consciousness viscerally felt, though the single tightening lacks a second micro-turn for 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.5)

    Dominant stake (guiding ships) tightens meaningfully when mirror-twin ship forces collaboration. Cost crystallizes in "shadowed elation" as conceptual burden of expanded purpose. Agency clear—laughter harmonies reverse wick’s reflection under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through "weight" accumulation, but escalation lacks one visible tradeoff (e.g., dye workshop consequences). Cost is felt not shown; "growing heavier" needs one tangible manifestation to reach 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (understanding labyrinth's purpose) tightens when Marcus realizes it processes sorrow, foreclosing his old role. Cost visible in transformed sextant, but "pin dropping" coincidence undermines protagonist-driven escalation under Accumulative lens.

    Stakes escalate causally through protagonist agency: failed infiltrations → bloodline gambit → badge discovery. Cost legible in "never return" exile, though "someone's been recording" dialogue slightly telegraphs tension.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Marina’s taste-sensing forecloses denial as convergence forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (memory vs creation) tightens through protagonist's agency: finding paint, interpreting note, drawing on cave wall. Cost crystallizes in irreversible act ("could never perfectly recall making"). Escalation via sensory deepening under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)

Elena's muteness breaking lacks sufficient friction to fully charge the final image under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Maya's agency as dance density increases pressure; "calm defiance" concept reshapes tactics, but grandmother's identity reveal slightly late for optimal cost legibility at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation through Accumulative lens is masterful: coffee patterns → cemetery dig → vial revelation tightens the dominant stake (reclaiming memories) into an unavoidable moral calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.4)
