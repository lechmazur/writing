  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure builds through accumulation: daily dust applications, colleague dismissal, dwindling vial contents, leading to Elias's recognition that forces his sabbatical choice. The stake—choosing between forcing outcomes versus witnessing decay—deepens when he feels "something shift beneath the dust," though the middle section could tighten its repetitive observations.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from artistic loss through brother's betrayal to choosing between pursuit and release. The ledger entry "pay in silver or the girl" effectively tightens pressure. Cost visible when she drops the ledger. However, the resolution's philosophical turn ("Maybe purpose wasn't in the making, but in the unmaking") softens what could be sharper physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: silence → failed piano strike → heat-map discovery → bleeding fingers → winterglass singing → world listening. Each attempt deepens the stakes from personal grief to cosmic transformation. The "storm welcomed her like an old collaborator" shows earned resolution with clear cost in returning to danger.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—giving the dead their rest—escalates from ledger-keeping to the lens's arrival to the lighthouse climb, with meaningful deepening when Elias understands "the city wasn't finished sinking." The cost manifests in his acceptance of his role and the lens crumbling after its purpose, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: solo runs become communal, silence becomes public declaration, individual survival becomes intergenerational legacy. The burned arbor represents peak cost, forcing the choice between hiding and visibility that defines the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal quest to universal keeper role, with the jade's revelation forcing Elias to confront his past failure. The escalation through memory recovery to accepting keeper status shows meaningful tightening, though the transition could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from unbuilding a maze to being trapped in recursive time, with the halo fragment's increasing pull ("hummed...burned...ached") driving urgency. The reversal when Liora realizes she's "trapped not in space but in when" forces her sideways escape strategy. Cost manifests in the screaming photographs and physical collapse, though the resolution through hurling the fragment arrives somewhat abruptly.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal freedom to collective survival through seed distribution. The guard's arrival forces immediate tactical choice, and Lena's decision to scatter seeds "not in rows, but scattered" shows agency foreclosing the option of controlled cultivation for guerrilla resilience. Cost is visible in her empty pockets and dirt-stained hands, though the immediate physical danger could be heightened.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from hearing the forge's voice, to collecting multiple absences, to the final imprint that makes the metal "remember" rather than melt. The rising water creates temporal pressure that forces Elias's acceptance. Cost is visible in the scars hissing, the greenhouse drowning, and his choice to be overwhelmed rather than resist.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from stealing a portrait to confronting fate itself, with the mirror revelation providing meaningful deepening. However, the resolution through hurling the jar feels abrupt, and Liora's agency in the final transformation—running toward the horizon and leaping—lacks causal connection to breaking time's code.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure builds through accumulation—seventeen winters of silence, the father's incomplete work, the choice between preservation and controlled collapse. The flooding sequence ("turned the final valve") creates meaningful escalation, though the stakes could tighten more sharply in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from physical threat (footsteps) to existential (erasure) to agency (reclaiming proof). The dominant stake—proving Lena exists—tightens through the shell's guidance and the ledger discovery. Cost is paid in blood and in accepting vulnerability as strength. Minor deduction for the child's challenge ("You gonna let him win?") feeling slightly manufactured rather than emerging from established pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening—each silence adds weight until "the map was not in the recording but in the erasure." The dominant stake (mapping the endless night through silence) tightens when Eldrin realizes he must become part of the map rather than its creator. Cost manifests in his dissolution, though middle pressure could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from questioning "where thoughts come from" through violin discovery to full identity recovery. The looped timeline revelation deepens pressure effectively. Cost is visible in the dissolution sequence and what X-7 must surrender ("directives and cortices"). One meaningful deepening that reweights all prior iterations.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes emerge through Lena's internal shift from mistrust to transparency, with the couple's conflict catalyzing her change. The dominant stake (overcoming mistrust through non-verbal truth) tightens when Lena acts by sliding the ticket across. Cost appears in "years" of defensive behavior now released, though more visceral present-tense pressure would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal (the vine dresser's relationship with the garden) to communal (transforming the elders' worldview), with the marbles serving as the pressure point that forces recognition. The cost—years of isolation and being misunderstood—is legible, though the elders' transformation feels slightly swift given their established pragmatism.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through Elias's lever adjustments intensifying from holographic displays to K-11's actual transition to "elsewhen." The AI's protests create mild opposition. Stakes deepen as the experiment succeeds but at the cost of losing the specimen, though pressure could tighten more dramatically in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: absence of sound → water-damaged messages → direct instructions → key discovery → playing the silence. Each revelation tightens the connection between Elias and Clara. Cost becomes visible in the final sustained playing "until the water claimed the last of the light."

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to warn about the storm—builds through accumulation rather than reversals. Pressure coheres when "the storm wouldn't break at dawn. It would break *now*." The cost becomes visible when she chooses silence and dissolution over certainty, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about father's confession to confronting supernatural manifestation, with the valve wheel serving as physical anchor against terror. The turning point—Elias choosing to turn the wheel rather than flee—shows agency foreclosing escape with visible cost. The pressure coheres through accumulating Gothic details until the apparition forces stance crystallization: carry the truth or abandon it.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening: from handling moss-covered books to entering the refuge to dissolving paper birds to final absorption. The dominant stake—preserving witness without judgment—faces pressure through the keeper's progressive dissolution, with visible cost in their blurring edges and shallow breath.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: three sessions of silence, then the risk of the eclipse trip, culminating in the ridge's response. The dominant stake (Mira's lost voice) tightens through each attempt. Cost is visible in Lila's "half laugh, half sob" and the generational passing of the curl.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving/understanding the world's lost stories—intensifies when the tapestry's dragons "move" and Elias feels "the displacement like a hook behind his ribs, tugging." This moment forecloses his option to remain a passive collector. The cost is visible when he leaves the silo's safety. Escalation could be stronger with more concrete opposition to his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal fortune-writing to espionage ("They're coming for the film") forcing Chen's departure. The dominant stake - maintaining open secrets versus exposure - tightens when the fisherman's daughter arrives. Cost becomes visible in "the lighthouse dark behind him for the first time in twenty years."

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Central stake (illumination vs preservation) is clear with meaningful escalation as the priest steps into the rising indigo. However, the possession entity offers minimal resistance after initial recognition, reducing dramatic pressure. The cost lands clearly but the opposition could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure builds through accumulation of sensory and memorial weight rather than external conflict, culminating in Li Wei's choice to "conduct" despite the waiting courier. The cost is legible in his acceptance of homesickness as temporal rather than spatial ("not a place but a *when*"), though agency could be more forcefully dramatized in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure (hundred/thousand attempts) to the decisive confrontation. The dominant stake - conquering the fractured self - tightens when Elias faces his shadow-version and chooses action over repetition. Cost manifests physically (runes searing) and metaphysically (tablet destroyed, timeline collapsed), with agency driving the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias's relationship to teaching and music after his deafness—is established early through the broken needle and student's rejection. Pressure builds through the drum maker's recognition ("You're not here for drums") to the backward songs revelation that reframes his understanding. The cost is visible in his acceptance that "silence isn't empty" and his choice to return to teaching despite past failure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: followed home → message arrival → "It's breathing now" revelation → choosing to record rather than flee. The dominant stake (confronting dangerous knowledge alone) tightens when Elias realizes the unknown has "followed him back." Cost is legible in his acceptance that silence won't last, though agency could be more decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief to understanding a parasitic relationship, with the perfume serving as the key that transforms everything. The dominant stake (understanding his mother's gift) tightens when he realizes the flowers feed on his sorrow. Cost is legible in his decade of unknowing servitude and the choice to destroy his livelihood. Minor deduction for the slightly passive discovery rather than more active pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: rope discovery → pendulum swinging → beings adding thread → rope snapping from resonance → burning transformation. The dominant stake (what to do with found freedom/pattern) tightens when the beings force the poet's choice, with visible cost in his burned hands and departure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving beauty/music in isolation versus sharing it—escalates through the girl's arrival, forcing Liora to choose between solitary preservation and risky connection. The cost manifests in abandoning her father's unfinished melody (a generations-long project) to create something new with the girl. Stakes could be heightened with more concrete immediate risk to either character.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through Liora's reading of the chemist's "jagged" charge revealing his cowardice, then her choice to absorb rather than sanitize the emotion, culminating in his breakdown. The dominant stake—authentic versus counterfeit emotion—tightens as Liora's intervention forces him to face what he's avoided with visible cost in his tears.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - whether these two will recognize each other as kindred spirits - builds through accumulated observations and culminates in the partnership proposal. The tension operates quietly but effectively, though it lacks the sharp edge of higher-stakes conflict. The cost (unbalanced ledgers, redirected supplies) is present but somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of belonging deepens from Reed's solitary creation to collective search to communal marking. The escalation through "I was here" to "We are here" to the constellation of touches shows meaningful accumulative pressure. Cost is visible in Reed's release of individual authorship for shared creation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes around the moths' existence and the giant's awakening are established early with clear consequences. The tension builds through the boy's appearance and ultimatum. However, the resolution through throwing the jar and pulling the thread lacks the clear cost-benefit trade-off needed for higher scores—we don't see what Elspeth sacrifices for the moths' return.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation occurs through deepening rather than reversal: from physical arrival to magical attempt to acceptance, with each stage foreclosing the possibility of resurrection. The cost is visible in "the hollow in his chest" and the deliberate leaving behind of something "that wasn't his to keep."

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's need for connection versus seventeen years of practiced invisibility—escalates through his increasing risk-taking: from passive observation to placing the tape, dropping the photograph, and finally stepping into light. The power outage creates external pressure that "cracked something open," forcing action. Cost is visible in his physical manifestation ("shadow stretch across the floor") after years hidden.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from scientific curiosity to existential transformation as Liora recognizes the tree's lesson applies to her own rigid control. The cost—abandoning her inherited methods and the nursery's commercial purpose—is visible when she hands customers linden leaves instead of roses, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more steadily.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening—from physical discovery to supernatural encounter to artistic transformation. The "threshing" demand creates pressure that forces Elias's choice to engage rather than retreat. Cost is visible in his decade of failed paintings now revealed as incomplete preparation, though the amber woman's disappearance could strengthen the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—Liora's relationship to foresight versus presence—tightens when the entity reveals what she couldn't see, forcing her to choose between seizing the pearl or accepting a new understanding. The cost manifests in her leaving empty-handed, though the entity could apply more concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: single valve discovery → community participation → restoration of voice. The child catching the valve represents genuine transformation with cost (Elias releases control). "Blow when you're ready" crystallizes agency transfer perfectly, though middle sections could tighten pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through pattern recognition, vault entry, and the punch "biting" into reality itself, forcing Elias to name his core lie. The stakes tighten from external mystery to internal truth with clear cost in admitting ignorance about his sister's fate. The final choice to step back into uncertainty rather than toward answers demonstrates agency with visible renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal skepticism through memory recovery to acceptance of ongoing grief with clear cost. The tile's warming and the vision of her brother represent meaningful deepening that changes Liora's knowledge and options. However, the resolution relies heavily on internal shift without external pressure after the vision, and the extended philosophical ending reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulating spatial distortions: flickering gravity, dimensional cracks, corridor breathing, until the amulet's expansion rewrites reality itself. The dominant stake—whether an immortal can truly let go—tightens when dropping the fragment forces irreversible transformation. Cost registers in losing solid reality for fluid possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal (cleaning up father's mess) to collective (twelve refugee lives) with the girl's arrival forcing immediate action. The dominant stake—finding fair trade mathematics—tightens when Lira realizes "twelve for *her*" was the real equation. Cost becomes visible when the pot shatters and transforms the space, though the physical/emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten lives through texture collection—never faces real pressure or opposition. The discovery of Elara Voss through the lamp's hum creates mild intensification but no genuine conflict or cost. The stationer's work continues unimpeded without meaningful escalation or narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from collecting a label to gathering stories to finding his own crossed-out name, each fragment deepens his erasure. The tide flooding "higher than usual" forces final navigation through water, with cost visible as Daniel chooses absorption over persistence.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to existential understanding as the journal dissolves and voices layer in the cello's resonance. The transformation from solving to adding creates meaningful pressure, though the middle section could tighten the cost of his decade-long pursuit more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through graffiti encoding (twist=meeting, jagged=spy) to the hand-clutching-stone mural that maps old waterways, teaching resistance tactics. The developers' morning arrival creates time pressure that forces Elira's chip-embedding choice. Cost is visible in "streaks of gold and crimson" on her hands—marked by her decision.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.7)
    Escalation builds through the three-hour countdown and the canister's timed pulses marking inevitability. The dominant stake—preserving beauty before erasure—tightens as "the drones' distant hum vibrated through the dust." Cost registers in Elias's final photograph capturing "his own shadow stretching toward home," though the conflict could press harder.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure builds through accumulation: detection through water, diagnosis through Lumen, the crowd's oblivious cheers creating urgency. The intervention carries cost—Elias works anonymously, receives no credit, returns to endless repairs. The tightening from detection to action to withdrawal tracks cleanly, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation tracks through accumulating evidence—falcon's delivery, Kael's disappearance, the translated warning—until Lena's deliberate breath-pattern on glass becomes active participation rather than observation. The lake's response ("not from force but from invitation") confirms her agency shapes the outcome, with clear cost in her dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: shutter creaks, chime shivers, footsteps echo, windows light. The deepening from physical sounds to manifestations of past life ("scent of bread") creates meaningful tightening, though the stakes could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from survival to moral reckoning as the signal dies and the hush gathers, forcing Liora's choice between erasure and acceptance. The oxygen countdown adds concrete pressure. Cost is legible in her permanent change and exile, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake of changing the beginning/breaking the cycle escalates through Elias's ascent, the lattice's unfolding, and the race against discovery. The hush moment crystallizes options effectively. Cost is present but somewhat oblique—the burden of truth-telling in a world of disbelief could be more immediately felt in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from Liora's smoke-like presence to physical tremors, to the greenhouse shivering and finally splitting open. The cost intensifies from "Each appearance cost her" to her complete dissolution, with the keeper's resigned participation adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—transforming ruin to reverence—escalates through the sleepwalking sequence where "the labyrinth *shifted*" (emphasis original), with paths unraveling and dead ends blooming. Cost manifests in physical toll and the foreclosure of return to the old wharf. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes build through accumulation - from touching warm stone to finding seeds to the sapling's emergence. The dominant stake (restoration through patient excavation versus abandonment) tightens when villagers leave offerings but won't descend. Cost is visible in the cracked sundial and Elias's solitary labor, though agency could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—creating an identity that "carries the sea but doesn't drown"—tightens through Lena's algorithmic process and manual tweaking. The hesitation before mailing shows cost awareness, though the pressure could escalate more sharply to force a harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving truth against censorship—is signaled early with "stars too honest for public consumption." Pressure escalates from the courier's warning through to the enforcers' arrival, forcing Elias's sacrificial broadcast. The cost is legible in the dome shattering and Elias's implied capture/death. Deduction for the vague "adjacent possibilities" mechanism that softens the middle escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure builds through accumulation: spirits humming, then swelling in recognition, then asking "What are you waiting for?" before falling silent. The stakes tighten as Liora moves from evoking incomplete phrases to the full "I miss you/I was wrong/Stay," though the sister's absence keeps tension somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from passive receipt of the cast to active decryption to the boy's arrival demanding immediate application. The coral's pressure "bit deeper" physicalizes internal conflict. Final transfer carries cost—Lena walking "toward the mist, where the shapes of other broken things waited" shows endless demand, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes build through textural accumulation: private discovery → studio experimentation → public sharing, with escalating emotional risk. The cost is legible—the projection's impermanence ("dissolving like sugar in rain") and Liora's acceptance of ephemeral beauty. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through layered awakenings that deepen understanding rather than reverse direction, fitting the Accumulative lens. Each recursion narrows Liora's options toward accepting the cycle. Cost is visible in her dissolution/transformation, though the stakes could sharpen earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from individual thought-taxation to collective resistance through garden networks. The discovery signal (*they know*) tightens pressure and forces tactical adaptation. Cost is visible in risk taken, though the final confrontation ("the city would burn with questions") remains more declared than dramatized on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from personal exhaustion to ghostly confrontation to new war's drums, each demanding greater transformation. The poet's response intensifies from whispers to singing louder to eating the manual. Cost is visible in the three-hundred-year toll and final cocooning.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates from careful tending → repair attempt → awakening threat → forced destruction, with each beat narrowing Liora's options until she must destroy what she tried to save. The cost is legible in the shattered chime and her sitting among ruins, though the threat's specific danger remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear dominant stake (preventing archive destruction/restoring truth) with escalation through the emissaries' approach creating time pressure. The cost is visible in the shattered inkwell and Elara's physical transformation. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient—the archive protecting itself removes some agency from Elara's final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from finding an artifact to discovering a hidden system to confronting the elders with a radical alternative. The pressure tightens as Liora realizes her father was branded a traitor for the same compassionate approach she must now advocate. The final confrontation crystallizes the cost: "Let them see the encrypted compassion in the lines."

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias can reconnect with music/Luca after trauma—escalates through the meteorite arrival, Madame Holloway's observation about what he's "let himself keep," and the pigeon's mission. The final return with sheet music forces Elias to choose between safety in silence or risk in reconnection, with clear cost in his imperfect humming.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from missing child to understanding thresholds must be crossed alone, with the maze's true center revelation deepening pressure. Elias's agency drives discovery through following wood grain and interpreting the note. Cost is visible when he chooses descent over extraction, though the resolution's ease slightly reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The luminous respite creates temporal pressure and escalates through Kael's arrival disrupting Elara's solitude. The hand-holding moment and synchronized breathing represent meaningful deepening under accumulative logic. Cost is visible in their separation - she stays below, he surfaces with glass fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking missing pieces to discovering they're internal, with time pressure from the migrating bird's "hurry" message. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through choosing to "let them in," though the conflict lacks a clear oppositional force beyond abstract "memory fading."

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from accidental first note to orchestrated harmonization with the fire-eater's flame guttering "in the sudden breeze." The dominant stake—Lior's need to find/create pattern—deepens when the woman recognizes "You played us," though the cost remains primarily philosophical rather than forcing a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: kneeling, dipping fingers for Orion's reflection, pressing dust to arm, verse blooming on skin. The dominant stake (transformation from exile to belonging) tightens as she moves from observer to becoming "the gap itself." Cost visible in "blood...the quill her own breath held too long."

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake - whether mundane attention can yield meaning - intensifies through the ritual's progression from stone-throwing to pattern-reading to the boat's return. Escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. Cost is visible in the daughter's absence and the harbor's inevitable forgetting, though agency could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—reconnecting with his daughter despite trauma—is established early through the ex-wife's ultimatum. Pressure accumulates through textural details (box's weight, moon's movement, dawn's approach) rather than external events, fitting the accumulative lens. The cost is visible when he leaves the box and walks toward the untouched valley, though the internal transformation could use one more beat of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding viable equations for hope despite repeated erasure—is clear and deepens through the gauge's revelation about measuring potential rather than height. The tide's progression creates natural escalation, and Liora's choice to continue despite erasure shows agency. However, the multiple timeline exploration dilutes focus slightly, and the stakes could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from mapping echoes to confronting personal legacy through the discovered negative and father's diary. The pressure coheres around whether Elias will remain a passive cartographer or actively engage with his family's story. Cost is clear in the emotional labor of completing the mural and the transformed relationship with the space.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Liora can continue her morally ambiguous work—tightens through the revelation of what her gift costs others and herself (the empty terrace vision). The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as details layer (borrowed heartbeat, stolen possibilities, the soldier's dreams), though the story lacks a decisive turn that would elevate the escalation beyond competent accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulation: from "You asked for terms" to "I asked for an end" to the revelation of Kael's earlier signature, building to his trembling reach for the pen. The cost is legible in "his voice was already unraveling, already human" and the physical act of signing despite knowing it will fail. One meaningful deepening that reweights the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will acknowledge his mourning for what he's destroyed—deepens through the egg placement that forecloses his pure destroyer identity. The act carries visible cost (sacrificing the last egg) and conceptual price (admitting his hidden sentimentality), though escalation relies more on accumulating reflection than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly through three thread encounters, each increasing resistance and revelation—from laughter to warning to physical shuddering of the sanctuary. The absorption of echoes creates clear cost as Liora's body becomes weighted with "a thousand unstilled voices." The final transformation from theft to liberation reweights the entire action, though middle development could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    The miner's violent reaction escalates from passive audience to physical threat, forcing Elias to reconsider his methods with clear cost—tomorrow he'll expose the strings. This single tightening turn narrows his options from puppet-master to vulnerable performer. The stake of ethical storytelling coheres through the shift from concealment to revelation, though only one major pressure point limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on honoring vanished migration through ephemeral art. Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening—from finding wing to building structure to watching it dissolve. The cost is legible in Lior's solitary persistence, though the conflict lacks visceral pressure since no force actively opposes him.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving lost names/language) coheres through Elira's ritual transformation, with escalation from whispers to chorus to bodily absorption. The cost registers emotionally but lacks concrete consequences - what exactly changes for Elira beyond internal acceptance remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking shelter to confronting identity across timelines, with the terminal's directives forcing increasingly difficult recognitions. The final negotiation between Lior and the path ("a dance, a negotiation") demonstrates agency through acceptance rather than action, with clear cost in surrendering certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about a loose tile through decoding its cipher to the threshold decision of entering the unknown passage, with clear cost in abandoning empirical certainty. The pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. The final transformation carries weight but could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening - from physical breaking to ghostly confrontation to shared walking. The dominant stake (reconciliation vs. holding resentment) tightens when Lior must choose between fixing the pin to "convince the past" or accepting what is. Cost is visible in leaving the music box behind.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening: from tracing broken sextant to synchronized breathing to sextant dissolving "like frost under sunlight." Each stage narrows his options—the fog pressing "like a second skin" forces the choice between holding on and letting go. The cost manifests physically as he dissolves into the stellar realm.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: finding ribbon → digging for root → discovering seed/note → planting → receiving answer through wind. The dominant stake (understanding why daughter left) tightens when the sprout's immediate growth forces recognition. Cost is visible in the three-year separation and the mender's acceptance of being the one who couldn't read the cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating revelations: cameo's resonance → reflection's warning → orchard's true nature → understanding the cycle. Each blossom touch deepens stakes (museum burning, previous curator, asteroid's past). The final choice between documenting/destroying/continuing crystallizes with clear cost—Veyra sacrifices safety for knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from theft to manipulation to confrontation to dissolution. The traveler's backward-ticking watch and whispered name raise stakes effectively. Cost is visceral—Elias loses his own name while the Library consumes the traveler.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: discovering the scales, finding the ledger, the swatch drinking ink, the sister materializing, then the revelation of other lost twins demanding rescue. The final choice to stay and save all carries clear cost (abandoning escape). One point where pressure could tighten further is the sister's materialization, which resolves too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: rope unraveling causes gear stuttering, door humming deepens, seal melts toward revelation. The stakes crystallize when Elara must merge rather than archive, though the opposition (the figure) could apply more active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: beings arrive → Eldrin reads fractures → conjures bloom → beings recoil → harmonization begins. The dominant stake (preserving the caves' essence) deepens when the bloom becomes "not a wall, but a door," forcing both sides to adapt. Cost is legible as the caves transform permanently, though the tension could tighten more sharply at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—proving meaning exists in coincidence—escalates from personal memory (mother's face in the first flare) to cosmic pattern (the beacon revealing design in collapse). The prism's mending represents a meaningful deepening that reweights all prior "coincidences" as intentional design. Cost is legible in her acceptance that connection may never come: "She didn't know if anyone was left to see the beacon."

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening—from measuring shadows to touching stone to receiving the vision. The dominant stake (understanding identity) tightens when "Her fingers brushed something colder than stone." Cost becomes legible in accepting the futility of her lifelong pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—breaking the curse of starlessness through defiant light—escalates from Liora seeing "potential in the hollow towers" to the fortress trembling and blooms flaring in response to her fireworks. The "hush thick enough to chew" deepens into active transformation as "the sky was a net of silver threads, trembling back into existence." Cost manifests in her leaving at dawn, the world "heavier" but her defiance proven.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: the fisherman's unspoken grief, the cicada's warming potential, the water drop creating ripples that "expand, then fade." The dominant stake—understanding transitions and grief—tightens when she sees "the shape of it, the way a shell holds the memory." Cost is legible in the relinquished heirloom and the fisherman's altered future.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through three inversions: discovery, climbing, then taking the bloom's silence. Each deepens the child's connection to the trellis while increasing distance from father/bunker. The gilded palm's "threads writhing like embers" creates irreversible change with clear cost in the father's wet gasps and final scream.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through the passenger's journey from silence to exhaled release, with the storm glass darkening in "recognition" of her specific grief. The child's laughter creates a meaningful test that Elias must navigate. Cost is visible in her "shoulders unclenched" and the "faintest traceries of what had passed through" in the vial.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to systemic change as Elsin discovers the throne's true nature. The sunrise deadline creates genuine pressure. However, the final choice lacks sufficient opposition - the decision to unmake feels too easy without visible struggle or competing temptation at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure escalates from ember's dying pulse through shadow's encroachment to the threshold offer, with Lior's agency in turning the ring releasing all shadows. The dominant stake—whether to maintain isolation or release the accumulated weight—tightens as the sanctuary itself begins fading, forcing action.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: bolt discovery → messages → reality ripple → conceptual unthreading → diamond transformation. Each beat narrows options under the textural lens. Cost is visible in blood, the farm's destruction, and Lina's irreversible departure into desert.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal failure through mysterious letters to the mirror revelation, with each discovery narrowing Elias's options—he must listen rather than seek. The standing wave tuning creates genuine pressure that forces stance crystallization. The cost of abandoning traditional scholarly pursuit for this new understanding is legible, though the exact nature of what he gains could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation operates through accumulative pressure: from the knight's initial stillness to touching the stem, finding the program, breaking the gauntlet seal, and finally speaking. Each beat tightens the threads—literally and figuratively—until the knight must choose between eternal silence or painful speech. The cost is legible: seven years of silence broken, shadows spilling from his hand, the transformation hurting "like holy fire."

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether forgotten foster children can claim meaningful connection. Pressure builds through accumulation—button discovery, research revelation, Elias's decision to send package—each narrowing his professional distance. The cost manifests when he abandons archival neutrality to become an active participant, "scanning for gaps" in Maria's file.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving erased histories—is signaled early and tightens when Rook reveals the archives will burn tomorrow, forcing immediate action. Lena's agency drives the escalation from waiting to acting, with visible cost in her eventual erasure. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as resistance shifts from observation to action.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—silencing the prophecy—is signaled early and deepens when the grotto actively resists, pressing "against his eyelids, his throat." The revelation that he wrote the prophecy himself creates a meaningful tightening that forecloses escape. Cost is visible in his endless return cycle, though escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive turns.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: moonstone discovery → arbor's response → monuments dissolving → climbing to sapling → physical transformation. Each stage forecloses return with visible cost (monuments crumble, arbor vanishes). The protagonist's agency drives each choice though the middle section's monument descriptions slightly dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: compass discovery → greenhouse exploration → waterfall descent → ledger revelation, each deepening the pattern of broken things teaching new truths. The cost manifests in letting go of control (releasing the gear) though the middle section could tighten—the waterfall dialogue feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from finding a clue to risking death for understanding, with the coin's heat "crawling up her wrist" forcing commitment. The dominant stake—understanding versus safety—tightens when Liora feeds the coin despite knowing "the backlash would reduce her to ash." Agency drives the choice to complete Veyra's experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—integrating rather than releasing the soul—deepens when Liora realizes "some souls didn't need release. They needed *integration*." The cost appears in the soul becoming part of "the story of the stones and the water," foreclosing traditional release. The escalation through laughter (broken→chorus→echoes) follows the accumulative lens coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: physical recovery → forest pull → shrine vision → understanding mercy's absence → final acceptance. The cost manifests in "body whole, mind a ledger of absences," though the middle shrine sequence could tighten for clearer stakes progression.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from seeking an anchor to discovering Elara's fate to accepting a larger role as bridge between worlds. The lens fragment's revelation ("not lost, but waiting in the between") tightens options and forces Lior's choice. Cost is visible in leaving behind the market and accepting the weight of carrying overlooked histories.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from passive observation to active listening with the mainspring barrel, to the revelation of seams not cracks, culminating in Elias's choice to unmake rather than repair. The cost is legible as "dead stars" fall and the child's laugh shatters, with ghosts gaining then losing solidity as their burden lifts.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressures: frost patterns signaling rupture, the whisper thrashing against containment, books releasing half-formed thoughts, reality fracturing. The dominant stake (preventing catastrophic rupture vs. enabling necessary awakening) tightens when Elias realizes he IS the system. Cost is unmistakable in his dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—legitimizing a lost civilization's legacy—escalates through Elias's decade of counter-theories to physical proof via the shard. The confrontation with Taelis crystallizes opposing worldviews. However, the archaeologists' threat feels somewhat abstract; their power to diminish the Republic could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: stone's hunger sharpens, chamber pulls "like a fishhook in the ribs," then full dissolution as "light, unchecked, is just another kind of fire." The cost progresses from tools rusting to Elias's complete consumption. One meaningful deepening that forecloses all paths.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure—the compass heating, water reversing, father's voice emerging—toward Elias's choice to "let his hand drop." The cost manifests in burning twenty years of notes, though the lagoon sequence itself lacks physical stakes or resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative density as the lantern slide reveals layers of previous visitors, building pressure that forces Elias's decision to carve. The storm's approval and path revelation provide earned resolution with clear cost (lost slide, emptied pockets).

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why flowers bloom at night—deepens through accumulative pressure as each discovery (postcards, glass shivering, preserved flowers) reweights Liora's approach. The key escalation occurs when the glass reveals its layers, forcing her choice between continuing to paint/document or accepting silence. Cost is visible: she abandons months of work and leaves barefoot into the night, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: diary discovery→visions→descent→confrontation→release, with the Historical Revision Board providing external pressure that forces Elias's stance crystallization. The shell arrangement as tactical response shows agency, though the officers' retreat lacks sufficient cost or consequence to fully charge the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief through active conception to communal responsibility ("A civilization didn't sustain itself on memory alone"). The alchemist's agency drives the transformation through sustained concentration despite doubt. Cost is visible in his physical degradation ("creak of his own bones") and isolation endured to achieve revival.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve or release the prophecy—emerges clearly through the ritual's unexpected result. Escalation occurs as the voice shifts from Akkadian prophecy to direct address ("You are the hinge"), forcing Elias to confront his role. The resolution through choosing to let the garden decide shows agency through renunciation with visible cost in his seventy-year steady hands now shaking.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal (mother's lost voice/name) through the acorn cap's unfurling to the vortex's awakening howl, with Liora's choice to "push" creating the decisive turn. The cost manifests in the vortex's wail of "thousand names unraveling" and the chick's permanent transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from testing routine to crisis when Elias discovers "the aftertone lingered too long." The tightening occurs through "He had minutes before zero hour," forcing immediate action. His choice to leave "deliberate slack" carries risk—the abbot would call it reckless—but prevents the storm from stealing the bell's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes deepen from personal isolation to cosmic connection, with the meteor shower providing escalation. The moment when "one star, brighter than the rest, hesitated" creates genuine tension, but the resolution lacks sufficient cost—Eli gains connection without meaningful sacrifice beyond leaving a job he was already spiritually beyond.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving/releasing the covenant—builds through accumulation rather than reversals, appropriate for the textural lens. The box opening represents meaningful deepening that changes knowledge and options. Cost is visible in the beekeeper's disappearance and the seventeen years of silence. Slight reduction for the ghosts' agency overshadowing the protagonist's at the pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation—from personal quest to understanding Marlen's project to reconceiving time itself. The discovery sequence creates genuine pressure through mystery. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off; Elias's acceptance comes too easily without dramatized resistance or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as density increase and pattern breaks consistent with accumulative lens - each discovered object (feather, kite) deepens the meditation on incompleteness. The dominant stake of finding beauty in fragments faces concrete tests. Cost is visible in accepting brokenness rather than repair, though pressure could intensify more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (proving symbiosis over purity) established early and deepens through Elira's work on the western sapling despite elder opposition. The cost is legible in her physical deterioration ("knees cracking like old timber") and ultimate death. One meaningful deepening occurs through Tomas's transformation from skeptic to convert.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through the revoked funding, the terminal's questions, and the figure's invitation, each narrowing Elara's options toward the final choice. The cost manifests in her empty lab and the equation she leaves behind, though the middle section could tighten the stakes more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal ritual to ecological vengeance as the coachman moves from scattered seeds to "seeds that needed darkness to wake," with cost visible in his poor sleep and dawn disappearance. The land's hunger "not for blood...but for roots" establishes clear opposition, though the conflict remains primarily internal/environmental without sharp reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—bridging distance to find connection—escalates from curiosity through active pursuit to final surrender. The cylinder's revelation tightens options by revealing the woman's death while opening the paradoxical path to reunion. Cost is visible in Rook's entombment and transformation. The escalation could be stronger in the middle section where the journey feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from passive sketching to active alignment of the sketch with stars, then the compass needle snapping into place, culminating in Lira's physical leap. The cost is legible—she abandons her role as station keeper to pursue an uncertain path. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the anomaly's appearance after years of waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from physical theft to emotional exchange when the Keeper confronts Lirien mid-heist. The tension peaks with "You think time is a thing to be stolen?" forcing Lirien's philosophical stance. The cost manifests in both the Keeper's vulnerability and the sky's transformation, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from preservation to transformation as Liora discovers the pawns "unbound themselves," forcing her pivot from historian to liberator. The penumbra's approach creates genuine pressure, and her final walking pattern "release" shows agency with cost. One meaningful deepening that changes her understanding and tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (recovering buried talent) escalates from physical search to internal reckoning to acceptance of cost, with the stone-as-mirror forcing confrontation. The "pain of remembering" creates genuine pressure that narrows options toward the single path of acceptance. Missing a sharper moment of resistance before final acceptance that would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on redemption through confronting past failure, with the tapestry revealing "You were right to doubt. But wrong to leave" as the key tightening moment. The cost is visible when he accepts the child's invitation to play. Escalation is more accumulative than causal, fitting the textural lens but lacking sharp pressure increases.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from private defiance to public confrontation, with the ritual's timing creating urgency. The dominant stake—whether truth or comfortable lies will prevail—tightens as Liora races to reach the carving spot before the ritual completes. Cost manifests physically ("fingers bleeding") and systemically (the spire shatters, the elders scream).

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from physical survival to metaphysical transformation as the acid sea claims the workshop beam by beam. The alchemist's internal question "What if it's not enough?" finds answer through action—choosing to step into the statue despite uncertainty. Cost accumulates visibly as "gears and cogs and all the half-finished repairs" dissolve.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through textural accumulation: from painting memories to entering the cave to final dissolution. The dominant stake—preserving connection with his mother—tightens when the pool reveals her image, forcing the choice between remaining in linear time or joining temporary eternity. Cost is legible in what he surrenders (his art, his life in the village).

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on proving whispers' power over shouts, with Elias's method creating tension through its delicacy ("knife screams when it parts flesh cleanly"). The boats' gradual turn provides measured escalation. However, external opposition remains minimal—Harkin's skepticism dissolves too easily, and the fishermen's return lacks concrete resistance or cost beyond vague "strange dreams."

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can transform loss into navigation for others—deepens through the progression of calls (clear on waxing moon, dissolving on wane) to her active instruction: "Start walking." The moon's phases create natural pressure that forces her repeated choice. Cost appears in accepting she may be calling "echoes of herself" while still building.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether to hide or reveal the eye's power—tightens through the warlord's men's arrival, forcing Lior's occlusion tactic. The cost is legible in his sister's suicide and the world's inability to lie, though the piece relies more on accumulated pressure than dramatic reversal, fitting its textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from receiving the flower, to investigating absences, to the saltwater revelation, to accepting the burden. The cost crystallizes when "the boutonnière would crumble by dawn" but the memory finds freedom. Could strengthen the middle investigation section's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    The creek's rising urgency and the chip's intensifying signals create coherent escalation under the accumulative lens, with the ants' deliberate procession adding textural pressure. The fork between "unsold maps" and "child's sob" crystallizes stakes clearly, though the emotional weight of the second path needed earlier grounding to maximize impact.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from dreams to physical climb to transformation with clear cost. The fireflies' shift from guides to teeth shows meaningful intensification. The queen's agency drives the choice to "let the light take her." Minor deduction for the middle section's slightly looser pressure before the transformation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (capturing vs. offering presence) deepens through Liora's challenge "You've been measuring the wrong thing," forcing Elias to revalue his entire practice. The jump forecloses his old extraction method with physical risk ("The landing was not [weightless]"). Agency drives the resolution but the middle lacks a sharper tightening moment before the philosophical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (escaping the chronicler role) established early and deepens through encounter with younger self. The burning of scrolls represents meaningful agency that forecloses the path of documentation with visible cost ("He'd *be* that scream, someday"). Pressure coheres under accumulative lens as repeated cycles intensify toward liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding versus fixing—develops through the woman's need and Elias's recognition of his new role. Pressure coheres as the screw's meaning shifts from tool to teaching object. The escalation is subtle but present: from examining object to reading gesture to accepting witness role. Missing a sharper cost moment that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure builds through the storm's gathering threat and the rune's physical demands (frost where fingers were, quill shedding its tip). The transformation carries visible cost through the crystallized tip and singing scars. Stakes deepen as Lian moves from fearing to embracing the space between storms, though the resolution could face more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciliation before irreversible loss—tightens through the perfume's painful magic that "dragged up the weight of every unsent letter." The orchard's impending destruction creates genuine urgency, and Mara's choice to stay and "plant something new" shows agency with cost. However, the magical escalation feels somewhat predetermined rather than arising from character decisions, limiting higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate through the library's dying breaths to the witness's choice to tear the dictionary. The cost is visible in the collapse of all history into a single book. However, the "spiral arbitration" remains too abstract to fully ground the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the counting ritual's intensifying physical manifestations (warm key, burnt copper smell, black water) with clear cost at each threshold. The woman's plea "You have to let go" forces Elias's decisive choice between opening the temporal gate wider or preserving boundaries, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen from technical problem-solving to confronting grief through the mycelium's "conversations." The pressure accumulates through pattern recognition until Lena must choose between measuring/containing versus joining/releasing, with her sister's death providing the emotional cost that charges this choice.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from following cryptic instructions to choosing between paths (gold/blue) to finally embracing contradiction itself—clear deepening under accumulative lens. The dominant stake (breaking from father's deterministic worldview) tightens through each lantern lighting with visible cost. Minor deduction for the middle dissolution feeling slightly consequence-free before the palm-stinging return.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on human connection through deliberate disconnection, with Elias's role as guide to lost callers creating tension. The woman's inability to "hang up" escalates through her crying to acceptance of tomorrow's call. Cost is visible in Elias hanging up first and his off-key humming that acknowledges imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation operates through accumulating ritual acts—kneeling, opening locket, dipping brush, tracing photo, pressing vellum to chest—each deepening commitment. The dominant stake (preserving memory to regenerate the covenant) tightens when she commits to return "as she always did," accepting the endless weight of this work.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from finding Dr. Carter to understanding the deeper system of reciprocal connection. The revelation that the cure is "just a list of names" effectively reframes the quest. The final transformation where Lena stops running carries emotional weight, though the middle section could use slightly more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from following musical trails to the stillpoint's revelation as a moment rather than place, forcing Elian to internalize navigation. The pressure coheres through accumulative sensory absorption until the forest "exhales" and grants the hidden melody. Cost is legible when grief transforms from raw wound to mapped terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to persist despite uncertainty—intensifies through the anomaly's revelation that "seeds were never wrong, the soil was," forcing Elias to reconsider his approach. Cost is visible in his years of failed attempts. The escalation through accumulative revelation works under the textural lens, though the middle section about contingent relationships briefly abstracts the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: signing faster → shadow appears → camera truly flashes → waves rise in color-chords. The dominant stake (recovering erased memory) tightens when the faceless entity manifests as active opposition. Cost appears in Liora's shaking hands and the camera's changed weight, though the resolution feels slightly swift for the threat level introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from archaeological discovery through self-recognition to the final burning decision. The revelation that "the promise was the fire" effectively reweights all prior destruction. Cost is visible in letting go of both the archive and the unnamed archivist's memory.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Lira shifts from passive suffering to active rebellion, culminating in the frantic drumming that releases memories. The cost is visible in the "gasping fish" of surfacing memories and her "slow and shaking" exhale afterward. Stakes deepen effectively though the opposition (doctors) remains mostly off-page, limiting direct conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: storm scrambles compasses, woman's challenge introduces fluid maps, coin reveals the hidden choice. The dominant stake—proving quiet persistence outlasts force—tightens when Lior must choose between escape and continued listening. Cost lands but lacks visceral intensity at the crucial decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on the boy's shame and severed connection with his father, signaled early through "carried his father's silence like a second skin." The guardian's light-weaving escalates from simple reflection to complex patterns that reframe the boy's understanding, though the resolution relies somewhat on the guardian's mysterious abilities rather than the boy's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate effectively from whispered threat through window displays to physical confrontation. The dominant stake (library's survival) tightens through coordinated resistance with clear cost. Slight deduction because the council's capitulation feels abrupt - we don't see their decision process, only the posted notice.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from passive dock work through the scrimshaw's vibration to bodily transformation, with the island's dissolution as final stakes. The cost of leaving human form is visible, though the whale's arrival and Elias's transformation feel slightly predetermined rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—breaking free from enforced emotional suppression—escalates through Lena's scream and the offering to teach whittling. The happiness tin discovery deepens pressure effectively. Cost registers in Harkin's fear/hope response, though the middle section could tighten pressure more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to maintain or dissolve boundaries—intensifies through the quartz's escalating hum and the lake's progressive thawing, with clear cost in Elira's loss of discrete selfhood. The tension between seeking certainty and embracing dissolution creates authentic pressure. Deduction for somewhat abstract rendering of the transformation mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on connection despite communication barriers, escalating from Elias's solitary practice through Liora's "I'm listening" signal to their final shared understanding. The phoenix's seventh-year cycle adds temporal pressure. Cost is felt in the old woman's bargains and Elias's willingness to pay ("I'd pay it gladly").

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of discovering "the texture of connection" deepens through Liora's manipulation of the lens, with one meaningful tightening when the hum transforms into "something like a voice." The cost becomes visible when she leaves the bell behind, though escalation could be stronger under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (processing grief through craft) established early and deepens through discovery of mentor's lesson. Escalation through accumulation: pendant→stencil→crane→flower→twelve cranes→community teaching. Cost visible in "hands didn't ache" implying prior pain, and winter timeline showing sustained effort. Agency through renunciation of solitary grief-work.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding how financial collapse spreads culturally—deepens through the woman's request and her brother's revelation, forcing Elias to confront the human cost behind patterns. Escalation occurs through accumulation: from reading individual clients to mapping cultural patterns to accepting responsibility for predicting "the next crash." However, the tightening lacks a decisive foreclosure of options or visible trade-off that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: from dust-covered artifact to humming vibrations to screaming release, with the historian's agency driving each escalation. The cost manifests in her aged reflection and the faded veil, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the stone to understanding the shadow phenomenon to risking her own essence, with the dominant stake (preserving hope's shape) crystallizing through Liora's sacrifice. The tightening occurs when she realizes she's "already half-empty" and vulnerable, though middle sections could apply more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake of redemption through genuine acts escalates through three layers of shedding (salve application, returning medicine, writing to victims). Each layer costs more emotionally, though the middle section's market visit could generate more immediate pressure rather than reported silence.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure - from hearing plants to understanding she "was the thing in the walls" to confronting her mother's file. The dominant stake (seeking closure vs. carrying wounds) tightens meaningfully. Cost is legible in the final acceptance of open wounds.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (finding the goodbye letters/unused love) tightens as Elara discovers the letters exist "in the flicker and the grain" rather than as physical objects, forcing her to engage differently with the films. The final renunciation carries cost as she releases her search, though middle escalation could be stronger under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal creative blockage to cosmic responsibility as "vessel for stories." The pressure coheres through accumulation—whispers grow clearer, the instrument grows warmer, culminating in the archway's dissolution. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "trapped creativity" without more visceral cost earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from mysterious cargo to world-renewal through Hollow's agency in placing the spark in the crate and winding the clock backward. The cost manifests in forty years of emptiness traded for this moment of cultivation, though the middle section's "divergent archive" exposition slightly dilutes immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation follows accumulative pattern as wind shifts, memories surface, and understanding deepens through "the hum wasn't something to be unraveled, but something to *become*." The cost of transformation is legible when he abandons wandering and leaves the gear. One meaningful deepening achieved through the realization sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue forward motion or embrace staying—tightens through Liora's encounter with the vigil keeper and culminates in releasing the punch. The "unused courage" in staying versus going creates genuine tension. Cost becomes visible when she relinquishes her ferryman tool. Escalation could be sharper; the middle section meanders slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from discovery (bolt) through recognition (pianist) to understanding (cost of silence) to choice (giving bolt/staying). The teacup shattering and woman's scream dying before reaching stairs show immediate consequences. Cost is legible in the pianist's sewn lips and Elias's returning pain "like distant music."

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from ignoring warnings to recognizing the knife-edge threat to acting despite personal cost. The sacrifice of Lirien's name creates genuine trade-off with visible price. Minor deduction because the pretender's admission deflates some earned tension, though the cost to Veythas remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: fragments assembled, rhythm tapped, water receding to reveal the road. The final choice between reporting and following carries real cost, though the stakes remain somewhat abstract (what exactly does following the road mean beyond metaphor?).

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal searching to collective reignition through the stones' activation—a deepening that transforms "waiting" into "listening." The hum's progression (feet→arm→chest→bay) creates physical escalation. Cost appears in "wreckage" and accepting the "mess," though the rebellion's specific opposition remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal defiance (skipping Reconstruction duties) through mystical discovery (the kite's script) to social transformation (Council confrontation). The dominant stake—evolving tradition versus preserving it—tightens when Liora must speak the embryo's future name, a choice that forecloses return to old ways. Cost manifests physically (vines overtaking ruins) and socially (elder's wavering voice when earth sings).

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether Lena can transform grief into something generative—escalates through the photograph's release, the child's misreading, and her decision not to correct them. The cost is legible in "the empty space where the photograph had been" and her acceptance that roots are "heavier" than grief. While the story lacks dramatic reversals, the accumulative pressure coheres around her shifting relationship to loss.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as walls close in and the library's "hunger" intensifies, forcing Elara from reconstruction to dissolution. The dominant stake—whether to resist or embrace unmaking—tightens through physical compression and the tarot's transformation. Cost is visible in her loss of artistic identity to become "part of the story."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through Kael's agency: from tracking to confrontation to the choice to understand rather than destroy. The cost manifests in his physical transformation and the irrevocable step through the ink pattern. The revelation that the thief is "collecting pieces" meaningfully reweights the conflict, though the final escalation could push harder against Kael's initial stance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal discovery to systemic exposure to martyrdom. The "blink that follows surprise" timeframe creates genuine urgency, and Elara's choice between compliance and truth has irreversible consequences. Cost is unmistakable in her death and the permanent system breach, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressures: tower's fall, father's voice commanding departure, dome's cracked pane threatening breach, culminating in Liora's stance crystallization to stay and tend. Cost legible in accepting isolation: "Neither did she" spread.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.0)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through pattern recognition (constellations walking again), physical excavation revealing the goddess's mouth, and the fisher's command of silence that forces resolution. The dominant stake—whether to hold or release his daughter's echo—tightens when "something else was wearing her voice," though the middle section could strengthen the cost of his thirty-year pursuit before the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from reputational doubt through familial betrayal to public truth-telling, with the ledger discovery forcing Lydia to choose between protecting her father's legacy or exposing corruption. The "orbit of regret" metaphor effectively tracks this escalation, though the plates' arrival reduces some earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through pattern accumulation: discovering letters → feeding memory to machine → amber cracking → time folding → final confrontation. The cost appears in "more stars to ink" suggesting ongoing debt. The pressure coheres under accumulative lens but lacks a sharp tightening moment that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal artistic expression to communal memory preservation as the mandala opens the void and releases "the village's buried doubts." The flake's burning and directive to "interject now" creates genuine urgency, though the resolution's cost (accepting dissolution) could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—whether memory can resist erasure through naming—deepens when the commander arrives with his sword, forcing immediate physical danger. The escalation from solitary work to confrontation to shared grief forecloses Elias's isolation with visible cost. "Mercy isn't what you burn. It's what you carry" crystallizes the stakes at the decisive moment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation operates through accumulative pressure—the orchard's offering, Lydia's recognition of Elias's despair, the visions of possible futures that "tangled with the present." The dominant stake (Elias's life/death choice) tightens through synesthetic overwhelm that forces his decision. Cost appears in both Lydia's fading and Elias forgetting "this ever happened."

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: static shock → sliver arrival → pressing to temple → walls breathing → Mira's voice → choice to paint the door. The cost is legible when Lena chooses to paint rather than immediately follow, creating a door "half-painted into existence." Stakes tighten as the sliver dissolves irreversibly into her skin, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from mapping echoes to active rebellion against stasis councils, with the cave's recognition forcing Lior's transformation into "voice of the unknown." Cost is legible when the fossil "seared their skin—not pain, but recognition" and the display dissolves into "a topographic map of grief." One meaningful deepening through cave-human communion satisfies scope requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from seeking one jar to understanding the button pattern to the physical descent into the well, with stakes rising from personal burden to village survival ("time would spill unchecked"). The cost becomes tangible when Elias must choose between completing his life's work or accepting human limitation, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (whether to rejoin/finish the mission) tightens through the pillbox opening, revealing the key and coordinates. Cost registers in physical marks ("silvered stains of a hundred fires"), but the man's appearance lacks sufficient pressure—his "They're not asking you to come back" arrives too easily. The internal conflict between prudence and daring drives escalation more than external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through fog lifting twice, gutters slowing then stopping, creating a narrowing window for action that forecloses waiting as an option. The cost manifests in the girl's separation from her mother and the coachman's acceptance of the cycle's continuation—both prices visible on page.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: the potter's search for kindness in ruins intensifies through the bee's arrival, the glass's warming thrum, and culminates in leaving the glowing bowl behind. The cost is legible in his solitary pilgrimage and the abandoned offering. Pressure coheres under the textural lens but lacks a sharp reversal or tightening moment that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: dying garden, wilting basil, blood offering, then Elias's arrival shifts the dynamic. The dominant stake—whether to remain closed or risk connection—tightens when she accepts his gauge tooth, foreclosing her isolation with visible cost in letting herself "believe."

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: the hum climbing to teeth-aching pitch, the Hesperornis's violent lunge at its reflection sending shockwaves, culminating in Lior's choice to release the bird rather than maintain their shared isolation. The cost is legible in the final separation—both characters choosing independence over the comfort of shared extinction-memory.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening as Liora moves from hesitation to surrendering the first spiral, then her own. The monk's words about "the thread that connects all things" provides the conceptual tightening. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract—we don't feel what keeping versus releasing these secrets costs her professionally or personally.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (career exile) through institutional (university fractures) to cosmic (alien manipulation), with Liora's intervention forcing a trade-off between safety and agency. The pressure coheres through the accumulating signal-to-conflict correlations, tightening when she must decide whether to transmit. Cost is legible: professional risk, physical discomfort ("pressure in her skull"), and the uncertain outcome of engaging unknown entities.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: vault discovery → compass insertion → descent into fear → chamber rearrangement → forced choice with the key, each deepening the spatial mutiny theme. The "test" moment when the compass aims at Elias's chest creates genuine pressure with visible stakes, though the resolution's ease after driving in the key slightly deflates the built tension.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure - from ribbon fragment to echo manifestation to the branded memory in the lance. The dominant stake (witnessing vs erasure) tightens when Elias realizes "she hadn't fallen. She'd been *erased*." Cost registers in his "methodical heart a little less still" and the weight he now carries.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal vindication to dimensional threshold crossing, with the nail's activation creating irreversible consequences. The pressure peak when "the glass shattered" and "the world snapped back" shows clear cost, though the final third could sustain higher tension through Elias's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the glass to the choice to abandon one's story entirely, with the flake's visions providing the tightening pressure. The cost—becoming the song, losing human form—is legible in the final beats. However, no genuine resistance or competing pull makes the choice feel too frictionless for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding circular paths versus forward momentum—deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens. The tightening occurs when Elias recognizes the train as his father's last heist and sees the parallel graveyard of tech campuses, though the pressure could intensify more sharply toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulating revelations: variable stars pulsing → temple materializing → voice threading through → ledger transforming. The dominant stake (understanding isolation vs. connection) tightens appropriately, though the sister subplot slightly dilutes focus without full resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from finding a missing brother to confronting the lake's true nature as keeper rather than killer, with the seed's violent digestion forcing revelation. The cost manifests in Eldrin's physical collapse under truth's weight and his choice to walk away from further revelations, though the middle section could tighten between planting and confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation coheres through the maze navigation where scars become compass, building to the chasm/bridge revelation. The cost is legible in "her shadows no longer rooted"—freedom gained through accepting the keeper role. One meaningful tightening occurs when future-Liora reveals the covenant "isn't ready" yet Liora must choose to cross anyway.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—trading away pain versus keeping identity—escalates through the needle-stitching ritual to the roots pulling at "the thing she'd hidden deepest." Cost is visible when she trades the child's name for freedom, with the white flower as tangible evidence. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, though the mysterious voice adds complication without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from appraising worthless objects to confronting his own worth through the cloth's personal significance. The widow's microphones create pressure that pays off when Liam chooses sentiment over market value. Cost is visible in his career trajectory and isolation, though the final acceptance could carry more immediate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from linguistic puzzle to metaphysical transformation, with the seed's planting creating genuine pressure—"the world tilted... not sideways, but through." The cost manifests in Elias's acceptance that he cannot stay with his resurrected wife, though this renunciation could carry more immediate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from cataloging paradoxes to actively smelting transformation, culminating in creating the spoon that holds "tomorrow's first second." The moon's waxing/waning creates persistent pressure. Cost is visible but could be more visceral in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through deepening confessions ("I wanted to be seen" → "I built this place to keep the world out") that reweight the inspector's understanding. The cost is visible when she accepts the pearl's burden, though the subsequent world-transformation lacks concrete opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes build through accumulative pressure: medication withdrawal → graffiti revelations → bridge decision. The turn right/left choice crystallizes meaningfully. Cost is visible in abandoning his chronicler identity, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the library's dissolution tied to the second letter's posting, forcing the dreamer to act under time pressure. The watch's cost (stealing from future to pay for past) creates genuine trade-offs. Agency manifests in the final choice to write rather than decode, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from authentication task to moral choice about art's ownership, with clear cost (losing payment/freedom vs. enabling hoarding). The midnight deadline creates genuine pressure, and Elara's agency drives the decisive destruction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the violin plays itself and reveals Silas's voice. Slight deduction for not fully dramatizing what "buying her freedom" means concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing "one last spark before oblivion" for the dead—drives Liora's actions throughout. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of sensory patterns that coalesce into the doorway/mirror, forcing Liora to decide whether to reach through. The cost manifests in her accepting the burden of the message, though the physical danger could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal seeking to communal healing through the silver fruit exchange. The grotto test ("What do you seek?") forces stance crystallization. However, the mystical transformation lacks some concrete pressure - the "thread connecting every ending" remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal routine disruption through confronting absorbed guilt to accepting fundamental uncertainty, with the shard's whispers forcing recognition: "You never unhooked from them." The physical unknotting of the cloak provides concrete cost as each thread dissolves. The woman's arrival raises stakes by offering witnessed vulnerability rather than isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: from simple meditation to reverse-aging trance to hovering suspension to final descent into darkness. The dominant stake (how to teach vanishing through appearing) tightens as Elias moves from withholding to active demonstration, with cost visible in his stuttering return to age sixty-two.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds from observation to detection of anomaly to predator arrival, with the skimmer's response shifting from reading to binding himself to stone. The cost is clear: accepting proximity to the Hollow Maw rather than fleeing. The "movement as confession" insight crystallizes the stakes effectively under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from exile/penance to understanding the sacred's true location—"not in the spectacle" but in stubborn persistence. The keeper's challenge ("mastery's just another kind of forgetting") forces Marlin's stance crystallization. Cost is legible when he leaves the keystone for others to "puzzle over" while keeping his unruly flame.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates from reading about frequencies bleeding into hue, to finding the preserved book, to entering the impossible door—each discovery narrowing Elias's path toward his final choice to "make" rather than find. The cost manifests in his transformed lantern and the Marigold's deeper submersion.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from interpreting static to dissolving the self atom-by-atom—a genuine foreclosure of physical existence. The reversal doesn't undo cost but transforms it: Liora must carry the burden of memory alone. Minor deduction because the "others" who cast lots remain abstract, reducing interpersonal pressure, but the dominant stake (existence vs. dissolution) tightens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the accumulation of crystallized fears becoming named monsters with "hungers given edges." The Leviathan's warning "You'll regret this" creates tension that pays off in the reaper's final acknowledgment. Cost is visible in the screams that reach him and the "shadow stretched behind him, longer than it should have been."

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from studying drips to attempting the spell to the bell weeping to finally achieving synchronization. The stakes ("cosmic imbalance," loss of fish/winds/gulls) are established early and the resolution shows agency through Elias's persistent experimentation, though the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as photographs shift from fragments of loss to bridges of connection, culminating in the burning ritual. The dominant stake—whether to preserve or release the drowned past—tightens through each image, though the middle beat where he "wanted to feed it" could show more resistance before yielding.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the ritual's irreversible nature - "the final transformation" that will turn her "from seeker to sage." The blue flame moment creates meaningful deepening. However, the middle section could tighten its pressure accumulation between setup and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from passive waiting to active mission with clear tightening: radio message → schematic retrieval → descent → device securing. The protagonist's agency drives each turn, with visible cost in her isolation and the weight of trust. The atmospheric pressure device's vague threat prevents higher scoring—more specific consequences would strengthen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from passive waiting to active merger as the custody hearing deadline and Emperor's rewriting history create time pressure that forces Kael's decision. The blood ritual carries visible cost ("pain lanced through his skull") and his choice forecloses the path of remaining split, though the Emperor's threat could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the mysterious seed through Lina's recognition ("It's breathing") to the business-killing decision to redirect customers outside. The cost accumulates clearly: losing his livelihood for a different kind of puzzle that "should unsettle you a little."

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring joy to the grieving household—is clear early and tightens when the blower dies and real laughter emerges. Elias's agency drives the transformation through his nightly ritual, though the family's sudden shift from brittle smiles to genuine laughter lacks intermediate pressure points that would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to release or guard the books' dimensional longing—is signaled early and tightens through the pendant discovery and the figure's arrival. Lyssa's agency manifests in her choice to surrender the pendant, foreclosing her role as guardian with visible cost. The escalation from waiting to active choice under the Accumulative lens coheres, though the figure's sudden appearance lacks some causal grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the crozier's increasing hunger—from memories to doubt to the forbidden incantation "Let it be worse." The cost is legible when his scars reverse and the world remakes. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. Minor deduction as the guild's reaction feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation follows the accumulative lens through density increase: fragment hums → dish activation → universe listening → towers singing → gravity reversal. The dominant stake (tuning cosmic frequencies) deepens through each stage, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral until the final leap.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through temporal pressure: "five minutes before the ferry unravels completely" forces action. Lira's agency drives resolution through deliberate timeline-stitching. Cost is visible—passengers gain doubled memories, the grotto seals, normalcy returns but everything has changed. The accumulative pressure of overlapping timelines coheres into decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal (threading memories) to collective (visitors experiencing shared connection) with the woman's warning "They're coming to dismantle it" providing external pressure. The eruption sequence shows clear cost as illusions resolve. One meaningful deepening occurs when patterns erupt, though agency could be stronger at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to civilizational transformation, with the chain link's progression from salvage to teaching tool to navigation instrument. The tension between elders' resistance and youth's hunger creates pressure. Cost appears in abandoning centuries of pressure-chart navigation, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to identity crisis as the mist intensifies from curling to screaming. The dominant stake—witnessing the forgotten—tightens when Elias realizes he IS the forgotten child. Cost appears in "His knees hit the stone" showing physical/emotional impact of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from cable salvage to discovering the phase seam to risking being "added to the things it remembered." The tide's return creates genuine time pressure that forces Elias's decision. However, the exact nature of what he risks and gains remains somewhat abstract, keeping this from higher bands despite the palpable atmospheric tension.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal mortality fear through the static mystery to existential communion. The pressure builds through accumulative reveals—the voice recognition, the ink patterns synchronizing with heartbeat, the fragmented transmissions coalescing. The final shift from isolation to shared existence carries felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from translation attempt to existential absorption as the diamond reveals its true curse—not for listeners but answerers. The reversal when "the echoes twisted, no longer passive reflections but something alive" effectively tightens pressure. However, Veyra's agency diminishes in the final transformation; she becomes more victim than agent, though her ancestral hunger does drive the fatal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (finding sister/understanding the missing) established early and deepens through the arrowhead-seed transformation that forces Elias's choice between "rot in his bitterness, or let the joke rewrite him." Cost is legible in his physical transformation, though the extended coda after the main closure slightly dissipates pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from trembling bow to louder playing to heart-rhythm signaling, culminating in the earth cracking and life unfurling. The statues' progression from patrolling to faltering to melting shows clear cost, though the transformation's ease slightly reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal risk (the scar, drone detection) to collective healing through the storm's release, with the seven-minute window creating temporal pressure. The cost manifests in Elias's commitment to repeated future deliveries despite danger, though the middle section with Lira could generate more active resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: finding fragment leads to following song, entering impossible car, witnessing alternate selves, then receiving/returning the halo with new understanding. The cost manifests when Lior's silence transforms from withdrawal to creative offering.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from touching the scarf, to unfolding it, to reading "spaces between" words, culminating in the library's transformation. The cost is legible—permanent loss of the mother's physical memento for the gained ability to step into memory-spaces, though the middle lacks a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: first attempt fails, second succeeds but reveals the dream's hunger, leading to the peaked choice between preservation and freedom. The cost is legible in the dream's dissolution and the librarian's physical response (salt tears, damp pillow). Some deduction for the dream-woman's limited agency and the slightly abstract nature of the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—freeing what's trapped—escalates from physical (opening a lock of hair) through metaphysical (releasing an idea) to philosophical (questioning whether protection and imprisonment are the same). The locksmith's agency drives the resolution through her choice to "let the locked thing decide," with visible cost in her retention of the unopened locket. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as details layer toward the final realization. Slight deduction as the man's agenda remains somewhat opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from detection to personal memory loss to active confrontation, with the fairy ring's blue flare marking the decisive turn. The trade revelation ("trading" not just "stealing") deepens stakes effectively. Cost is visible in Elias's trembling hands and the weight of returned memories, though the final confrontation could show more immediate price.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from reading tea leaves to binding an active shadow-door that "lunged upward." The pressure coheres through accumulation - from nervous tea-reading to active annotation that makes Kael's "fingers still smudged with tea and something older." Cost is visible in the transformation and what's ahead: "Now you learn the cost of coming back."

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder across the veil—escalates from seed contemplation through the girl's fading state to Elias's choice to paint her with twilight juice. His disappearance and the emergence of the silver sapling show clear cost. The tension between capturing/shaping versus passing through deepens meaningfully, though the girl's agency remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through silence accumulation and the weight of the unraveling decision, peaking when "The knot unraveled itself." The stakes—whether to maintain the town's false peace or release the spirits—tighten through Elias's stillness and the woman's voice warnings. Cost is visible in the sanctuary's destruction and town's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening as each film reveals new discrepancies (shadows pooling vs. climbing), culminating in Elara's recognition that the whispered chapel exists "between the seasons." The cost manifests in her acceptance of unmeasurable knowledge over Guild validation, though the stakes could tighten more explicitly in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding what Amelia discovered about thresholds—escalates through the snow falling upward, then sideways, forcing Liora's stance crystallization. Her choice to file a false report ("No significant findings") carries professional cost. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from encoding messages to the ghost wanting "into him," forcing the crucial choice between absorption and refusal. The balladeer's agency drives the resolution through his final encoded rest symbol and bolt plate slam. Cost is visible in his empty hands, raw throat, and the child now marked to continue the work.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation operates through accumulative discovery: diary → cipher → realization about joy measurements → understanding the servant's perspective → final instruction to "look up." The dominant stake (finding meaning in isolation) deepens appropriately, though the middle section could benefit from more active resistance or cost before the final revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving the atmosphere remembers—escalates from observation through untethered drift to final surrender/integration. The string breaking creates immediate physical stakes that deepen into existential ones. Cost is visible in Elias's acceptance of falling and transformation from observer to "thread in the spool."

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether meaning can be held/captured—escalates from portraits to library to accepting limits. The demolition deadline creates coherent pressure, and her choice to stay as the ceiling collapses shows agency with cost. Under the accumulative lens, the deepening works through pattern (faces→sky→nothing) though the middle section's escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal transgression to ship-wide survival as Liora connects the phrasebook phrase to the glowing hopscotch pattern. The engine failures create genuine urgency, and Veyra's shift from anger to trust marks meaningful pressure. Cost is visible in weeks of drift and depleted resources, though the resolution comes perhaps too smoothly once the pattern is recognized.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from repair work to temporal manipulation to sister-recovery, with each gear placement building pressure through resistance ("gummed with something darker than rust—memories"). The child's appearance saying "you're late" creates urgency. Cost manifests in three years of preparation, though the final door opening feels slightly convenient despite the earned build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - transforming Veyth into the nebula of respite - signals early and deepens through collective effort rather than reversals. Escalation occurs through accumulation (more arrivals, more repairs) with cost visible in the war-damaged land, though agency feels distributed rather than driven by Liora's decisions. The final "We stay" crystallizes stance with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate from clock maintenance to releasing all stolen time, with Elias's thread as explicit price. The puppet head's lullaby creates the turning point that forces his choice between continuing his role or releasing the trapped moments. Cost is legible: "no more adjustments, no more stuttering hands, just the final chime."

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of whether to help travelers intensifies through the dying girl's arrival, forcing Liora from passive knowledge-holder to active guide. The frost deadline creates time pressure, though the escalation relies more on accumulation of detail than dramatic reversals. Cost is present but understated—Liora's risk in defying the system could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from identifying sister's body to placing chrysalis to wading deeper. The girl's appearance provides external pressure that crystallizes his stance, though the escalation relies more on internal realization than external complication.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from opening-day anticipation through the patron's mysterious request to Liora's realization of her cyclical role, with the "glimmering parole" transaction forcing her to confront what she truly trades in—absences rather than objects. The cost appears in her acceptance that she'll never write the tales herself, though the patron's stakes could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on Elias drowning in accumulated memories, with escalation through his journey to the pavilion and the ritual of depositing the soldier's memory. The emotional contagion of the pavilion ("you couldn't tell where yours ended and another's began") raises cost, though the resolution feels somewhat predetermined rather than fought for.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—healing linguistic division at the elevator—is signaled early through Elias's complaint. Pressure builds through Liora's intervention with the weight and index cards, but escalation lacks genuine resistance or complication. The resolution comes too easily through symbolic gestures rather than dramatized struggle. Cost exists (years of grudges acknowledged) but doesn't manifest in concrete obstacles during the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering/integrating lost memories—escalates through Lena's active modification of the mirror and herself, culminating in her acceptance of entanglement over abandonment. The progression from seeing her reflection to stranger's memories to full integration shows meaningful deepening. However, the lack of immediate opposition or complication limits the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The one-hour inversion creates genuine time pressure that forces Lysara's rushed choice. Escalation follows the drive lens as options narrow (grotto opens→chamber revealed→must choose one seed→gravity snaps back). The brother's loss provides emotional stakes, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined rather than wrestled from opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: from hearing whispers in wood to making the oak sing, from personal communion to the grove's collective listening. The deepening occurs when the insulator begins weeping and Elias chooses not to wipe it away, accepting grief as necessary. Cost manifests in his numbed fingers and the fevered-hot insulator.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from Elias's personal exile to the covenant's renewal through the girl's arrival and her question about memory. The magnetic field's intensification parallels emotional pressure, culminating in the board creating an unprecedented pattern. Cost is visible when Elias surrenders his worry stone, symbolically passing both burden and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity about the diary to confronting Elias's core belief that "empathy was a frequency you had to tune into." The fireworks create genuine time pressure, and the diary's final entry forces him to reckon with his avoidance of conflict. The cost manifests in his leaving the workshop and opening himself to others' damage. Deduction for the resolution feeling slightly predetermined rather than fought for in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal ambition (stealing seed) through communal confrontation (Elders gathering) to village-wide revelation (flower as mirror showing collective fears), with Liora's agency driving each turn. The cost manifests in exposure and judgment, though the village's quick acceptance slightly softens the price.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from navigation challenge to discovering the planet's secret to becoming physically transformed by it. The inversion's time limit creates genuine pressure, and Veyra's choice to let the moss spread rather than resist shows agency with clear cost. The tension between following her mentor's path and risking his fate works well, though the resolution feels slightly rushed in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from silence to vibration to the wind's scream, with Veyra's tools literally breaking under the pressure. The flare creating a moment of reprieve ("The wind *recoiled*") provides a genuine reversal. The stakes—understanding versus survival—tighten appropriately, though the resolution's abstract nature ("the city had learned") slightly softens the concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to control or liberate the aurora—escalates through three chime strikes, each deepening the transformation. Liora's agency drives every beat, from stealing the amber sheet to striking each chime "not to constrain, but to *unfetter*." The cost is legible: breaking centuries of tradition, defying the elders, and irreversibly changing the village's relationship with wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from failed guardianship through the child's emergence to Elias's choice to follow rather than guard, with each flute note widening rather than sealing the breach. The cost is legible in his abandonment of thirty years of purpose and the irreversible opening between worlds.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: catching fragment → printing with it → press printing autonomously → fragment rising → Elias accepting transformation. The cost manifests as releasing all borrowed emotions ("let them change him"). The dominant stake of understanding emotion through others deepens when he realizes he must give rather than take.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: pendant vibrates → woman appears → vine grows → bridge forms → courier dissolves. The dominant stake (finding what hums/understanding the mentor's fate) tightens through each revelation, with visible cost in the courier's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation through accumulative density: frost patterns → vision of woman → mother's face → prism glowing → forced choice. The cost is legible in cut palms and "shoulders unknotting for the first time in years." Minor deduction because the middle vision of the woman feels slightly disconnected from the final mother revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of reconnection across impossible distance deepens through the spinner's sacrifice and the lover's reciprocal commitment. The cost escalates from personal craft to bodily dissolution, with the amber bead forcing the irreversible choice. Agency manifests as deliberate renunciation with legible price.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening—from finding silk to hearing whispers to feeding it into the planet's wound—with the smith's deliberate agency driving each choice. The cost is visible (silk spent, risk of collapse) though the planet's immediate positive response reduces tension at the critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from finding the shard to the seam closing/reopening to final choice. The "weight" accumulates meaning across beats—grams→meaning→promise→fear/thrill. Cost is visible when she steps through, leaving the known world behind.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from ritualistic glass placement to burning letters to finally climbing the stairs and writing back. The pressure isn't external conflict but the weight of isolation versus connection, with each letter and stone raising the emotional cost. The final commitment to stay and "build a door" crystallizes the choice between safety in isolation and risk in connection.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from routine duty to preventing catastrophic dawn ("The next sunrise will be the last you recognize"). The shadow-being's appearance forces Liora's decisive "You can't have it" stance. Cost manifests in her permanent isolation—villagers fear her, yet she must continue. The tension between protecting and being shunned creates authentic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal understanding to communal healing as the protagonist discovers his power isn't to tell stories but to help others find theirs—"the hollows that ached to be filled with color and caution." The physical cost accumulates ("painted until his arms burned") though the middle village sequence could sharpen its specific pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through the sextant's dismantling—each piece pulses, the air thickens, Elias feels "a sorrow, quantified." The escalation from questioning what trees witness to understanding they absorb represents meaningful deepening. Cost appears in the trees growing "heavier" and Elias's hands "still stinging from the sextant's memory," though the protagonist's agency in the resolution could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—reviving the dying realm through recovered songs—escalates effectively as Liora's voice cracks, the greenhouse shudders, and finally the mirror world sings back, forcing her transformation. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as each sung memory adds density until the critical mass triggers change. The cost is visceral (bleeding fingers, burning throat) and existential (Liora's release/dissolution into the song itself).

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: invitation discovery → hidden chamber → confrontation with Voss → transformation. The dominant stake (confronting vs. hiding from guilt) tightens when Voss appears. Cost is legible in the twelve years lost to hiding and the courage required to leave.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: single bread→planting→wheat field→mass baking→city transformation. The dominant stake (confronting vs. adjusting to wrongness) tightens when guards abandon posts. Cost is visible in years of absence and the prince's tears, though the resolution's ease slightly undermines earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation through accumulative pressure: library groaning, shelves collapsing, time running out drives Elias to work faster, then discover personal connection in the vows. The final choice to step forward onto the uncertain bridge while the library dissolves shows clear cost and agency.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through Lena's calculated trap: offering false routes → letting Veyne's greed expose him → capturing his moment of realization → invoking market justice. The cost is legible in "By sunrise, the harbor would take what it was owed," though the protagonist's agency in the final resolution relies slightly on external enforcement.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from measuring others' weather to becoming weather herself, with the compass ring's wild spinning then pointing at her reflection marking the key reversal. The cost is legible (loss of skepticism, absorption of the ring, transformation of identity) though the "forests voting" mechanism remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (artistic expression vs. familial duty) established early and tightens through the lock mechanism revealing the mother's hidden gift. The pressure builds from grief through discovery to explosive creation with clear cost—abandoning the safe, controlled world above. One meaningful deepening as the lock transforms from burden to key, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal inability to lie through discovering the map, descending into danger, confronting collective truth in the Archive, to finally choosing unguilded honesty. The cost manifests physically ("wrote until his ink ran dry") and metaphorically as he accepts bleeding words over gilded safety.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure builds through the sculpture's acceleration and ice thinning toward inevitable shattering, with Liora's awareness creating tension ("She knew the moment it would shatter"). The dominant stake—preserving wonder in a world grown "loud and brittle"—is clear, though the escalation remains primarily textural rather than decisively causal.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The magnetic shift creates escalating pressure that forces Elias's choice between preservation and destruction, with the fire representing genuine agency under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in burning 127 years of work and abandoning programmed purpose. The stakes deepen effectively from maintenance crisis to existential choice about containment versus freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (proving listening heals through connecting lost stories) is signaled early and tightens when Mira must decide whether to open the private letter. The escalation follows the textural lens as discoveries accumulate pressure. Cost is visible in Mrs. Delgado's emotional response, though Mira's personal risk in choosing to share remains understated.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: dice roll → system activation → dance requirement → flooding chambers → final escape. The cost is legible as Lira sacrifices the physical evidence of her life's work to preserve its essence within herself. Minor deduction for the middle section where the stakes briefly abstract into philosophy before re-grounding in the flooding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure - the stone's increasing weight signals proximity to discovery, culminating in the chamber confrontation. The cost is visible in the destroyed materials and the protagonist's acceptance of eventual death. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes memories are "taken" not lost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (preventing world's unraveling through silencing the prophecy) escalates through the ritual's progression: reading water→unfolding origami→catching escaped thread→accepting partial success. The "snap" moment provides reversal when the prophecy thread breaks free, forcing adaptation. However, the abstract nature of the threat ("weight of its own unspoken fears") and the lack of immediate consequences limit visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about whispers to signing a blood contract to inheriting Veyra's role. The building's grief has "sharp edges now" shows clear cost. One meaningful deepening as Elias learns the language isn't for learning but "interrogating," forcing his question about the woman in the wallpaper.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory preservation to systemic rebellion, with the garden's shuddering and petal transformation marking clear intensification. The cost is visible in Liora's emptying ("her chest was empty") and capture. Slight deduction for the patrol's somewhat convenient hesitation, though their fear of the light maintains plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of unlinking tyranny escalates through the Emperor's arrival, creating pressure that forces the forger's choice between fleeing and enduring. The thorn's dissolution and the Emperor's request to be taught provide meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in seventeen years of calibrated treason and the tears on both men's faces.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through progressive disclosure: traitor's name, location, then the hollow's secret. The confrontation crystallizes when Veyra must choose between wielding the nexus's power or rejecting it. Cost is legible when Kaelis screams and loses his power, and in Veyra's sacrifice of the shell, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: widow's plea → globe vision → wrong ghost revelation → Lena's own reckoning. The deepening from helping another to confronting her own salvaged wreckage ("My turn") creates meaningful pressure. Cost is legible in both the widow's transformed understanding and Lena's accepted burden.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening as Liora moves from skepticism ("Why fix what no one sees?") through concrete discovery (minnows responding) to understanding patterns exist "because they're seen." The cost manifests in choosing invisible labor over visible reward, though the pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds from investigation through physical resistance at the stillpoint to visions that reframe the entire Liquidation, forcing Elias to choose between exposure and participation. The cost lands clearly—his literal dissolution/multiplication—though the "cure vs curse" reversal could use one more beat of resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating radio messages ("You are the hinge, little god") to the portico cracking to Elias's decisive action of hurling the receiver through the glass. The cost appears in the world transformation below and Elias's acceptance of his prophetic role. Some middle beats could tighten—the pressure plateaus briefly before the crack appears.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving vs. sharing captured sounds) tightens when the girl's request forces Elias to choose between hoarding and passing on his collection. Cost appears in "decades of held breath" released, though escalation under the Accumulative lens could deepen further through the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from ice thinning to the sphere threatening release to the engineer's bodily sacrifice. The dominant stake (preventing catastrophic resonance) tightens through her realization that she must become the harmony herself. Cost is unmistakable in her physical transformation, though the world-level threat could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—revolution through patience versus action—is signaled early and deepens through the viaduct's transformation. The sister's challenge provides genuine pressure that forces Lior's stance crystallization. The cost is legible in his isolation ("did not look back") though the viaduct's actual rising feels slightly convenient despite the moon-path setup.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from safety investigation to uncovering deliberate erasure of history, with water as immediate physical threat. The revelation about flooding old routes raises cost and narrows options. Elias's agency drives the discovery and his choice to pursue archives despite danger, though the antagonistic force could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - Elias's need to transform guilt into action - escalates effectively from receiving the heart through fixing the music box to finally writing the letters. The storm sequence provides external pressure that mirrors internal urgency. Cost is visible in his soaked journey and years of accumulated regret.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation follows accumulative pattern: repeated crashes into acid sea, kaleidoscope revelation, arrow integration, then conducting breakthrough with workshop destruction as cost. The "first draft" reframing shows agency in accepting destruction. Minor deduction for the conducting shift feeling slightly sudden despite setup.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to existential sacrifice as Lena discovers the system's consumption of human memory. The tightening occurs when she must choose between safety and restoration, with clear cost in her flagging for termination. The conflict between preservation duty and family loyalty creates authentic tension that pays off in her final acceptance of deletion.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate appropriately under the textural lens as visions accumulate urgency about the child's imminent danger, forcing Elias from observation to intervention. The cost is legible—abandoning his shadow-role to become "foolish enough to step onto the ice." Minor deduction because the child herself never appears on-page, keeping some tension theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from personal (euthanasia appointment) through immediate risk (ice crossing) to existential choice (staying for "slow unraveling"). The ice-walking scene provides concrete test with visible danger. Cost is legible but the middle section could tighten - the villagers' reaction dilutes momentum slightly before the stronger ending beats.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the failed relationship—deepens through the letter discovery and memory excavation, with meaningful escalation when Lior shifts from recreating Mira to "rediscovering the space between them." Cost appears in accepting both truths simultaneously, though the internal nature of the conflict lacks the visceral pressure that would elevate beyond competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from sensing the parapet's pulse to full consecration where "the clearing's edges sharpened." The prophet's followers marking dunes with "sigils of flame" provides external pressure. Cost appears in Lysan's physical commitment and the temporary nature of her holding—"long enough" acknowledges inevitable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transmuting collective trauma into healing art—is signaled early and deepens through the archivist's patient observation and final photographic act. The pressure builds texturally as images accumulate: weeping man with lunch pail, baker kneading with once-angry hands, girl chasing butterfly against ruins. The cost manifests in "for the first time in weeks, her chest didn't ache."

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure builds through the crystal's revelations ("The pattern wasn't in the words. It was in the silences") to the woman's arrival confirming a wider phenomenon. The stakes deepen when "They're all doing it" transforms personal obsession into collective testimony. Cost becomes visible when Elias abandons his thirty-year solitary practice, though the final escalation could push harder against his reticence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: chalk spiral, driftwood arrow, tape's hum, sculpture's animation, each layer tightening the noose of Elias's compulsion. The cost becomes legible when he breaks the arrows and walks away from his prophet role. Could strengthen with clearer stakes around what "locating" serves.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of preservation vs. release escalates through Elias's choice to sync with the hand's rhythm rather than stop it, with clear cost of leaving his life's work. The pressure coheres under accumulative lens as physical sensations build. Missing sharper tactical shifts that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes center on executing a "flawless goodbye" with Mrs. Calloway's terminal diagnosis as pressure. The music session deepens from performance to genuine connection when Mrs. Calloway recalls her husband. Cost becomes visible when Lena releases the vinyl shard. Deduction because the escalation is gentle rather than sharp—appropriate for the material but limiting dramatic tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about missing shadows to existential transformation. The automaton's warning ("The last scholar who tried this became the first shadow") creates clear cost that Elara accepts. However, escalation relies somewhat on revealed information rather than active pressure, and the final transformation happens quickly without intermediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from discovering the tooth through the changeling encounter to the negotiated restoration, with Liora's "Turn them into stars / So we can find our way" representing agency through renunciation. However, the brother's effortless return deflates the established tension about transformation's price.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation operates through textural deepening - from personal practice to memory to the arrival of the student, with each layer adding weight to the central metaphor. The girl's request crystallizes Liora's purpose, though the stakes could be more viscerally felt beyond the metaphorical register.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through textural accumulation—from Lena's solitary tracing to Javier's arrival to the shared planting—each beat deepens the emotional stakes. The pendant exchange provides the decisive intensification with clear cost: Lena surrenders her protection to help another. The "wounds as soil" transformation lands with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from hearing critical voices to seeing fragments to confronting the faceless figure to final dissolution. The cost is visible (Elias's physical form), though the middle cameo sequence could tighten—each figure should more directly pressure his specific struggle with control.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal reluctance through physical struggle ("throat burned, chest tight") to communal restoration. The cost is embodied in Mira's physical strain and years of avoidance, though the arbor's too-complete recovery deflates some earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as density increase and pattern deepening appropriate to the textural lens—from arranging materials to binding starlight to understanding her true purpose. The cost is legible in her physical deterioration and chosen isolation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seal succeeds and she grasps her role as teacher rather than preserver.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as "the wounded season was ending; soon, the echoes would thin." The locksmith's accelerating work—"sketching diagrams in the dust with a charred stick"—shows urgency building toward the mechanism's completion. Cost manifests when his wife's voice returns but "warbled, stretched thin in places," acknowledging imperfection even in success.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: individual weights → grotto's ancient burden → Elira's absorption. The grotto's counterpressure ("wanted to give back") forces her final acceptance with clear cost. Agency manifests as renunciation—she accepts becoming the loom rather than fighting it.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure accumulates through carving iterations—from "lion's haunch" to "mid-leap"—each attempt deepening her confrontation with loss. The girl's question about lions "stepping out of the wood" forces articulation that tilts toward keeping the final piece.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through the confrontation with ghost-iterations demanding acknowledgment, tightening when they emerge from the lagoon as a "chorus of regret." The jump creates agency through acceptance rather than resistance. Cost is visible but the stakes could sharpen earlier—the dominant stake of confronting abandoned selves emerges clearly only at midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through Lena's discoveries: finding the sextant, tracing its alignment with traveler desperation, activating the hydroponics, repurposing the terminal. The dominant stake—finding meaning in abandoned infrastructure—tightens as she transforms failure into function. Cost is visible in the town's lost belief and Lena's sleepless dedication, though the middle hydroponics beat lacks immediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to complete the forbidden orrery—intensifies through the crystal's whispers revealing themselves as "echoes of his own unfinished work." His choice to crack the crystal and arrange the pieces "not as they should have been, but as they had always wanted to be" shows agency foreclosing the path of obedience with visible cost in the broken forecourt.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulating realizations: doubting father's stories → finding first coordinate → understanding lies as scaffolding → choosing to let go. The cost manifests when she drops the ledger "without a ripple" and anticipates walking away from gold, though the internal nature of conflict limits visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from collecting stories to discovering the archive to accepting custodianship, with the fulgurite's warmth signaling transformation. The dominant stake of preservation deepens meaningfully, though the personal cost of this infinite responsibility could be more explicitly dramatized rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding absence to heal—progresses through Elias finding the thread, discovering the locket, and realizing the prince chose departure. However, escalation remains gentle without sharp reversals or mounting pressure; the discovery unfolds too smoothly. The cost emerges in Elias's commitment to board ships as a "cartographer," but this decision lacks immediate trade-offs or visible struggle in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reawakening beauty) signaled early and tightens through the egg's transformation from potential to "flawed genesis." The creature's emergence escalates pressure as it becomes clear success means accepting imperfection rather than recovering lost perfection. Cost is legible in the "ugly trying to become beautiful" and the prince's laughter/weeping convergence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.0)
    The boy's wound creates immediate stakes that test Liora's commitment to healing over destruction, with her instant response ("on her feet before the sound faded") demonstrating agency. The conflict escalates from internal meditation to external crisis requiring action, with visible cost in the bloodied thread. The dominant stake of proving compassion can transform destruction is clear, though the village's opposition remains largely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: following breadcrumbs → finding the sealed door → memories fighting back ("stretching like taffy") → the chamber trembling as threads snap. The dominant stake (liberating memories) faces genuine resistance with visible cost as "the city's fountains began to weep." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: from observing patterns to activating the gear to sacrificing memory, each step narrows options. The cost is unmistakable—"let the gear take the memory of her first bloom"—though middle development could tighten between observation and final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from solitary carving to spectral visitation to migration arrival to family gathering. The chisel slip that cracks Liora's stone forces the carver to confront suppressed grief, while the father's intervention reframes his entire practice. The final teaching moment with his daughter shows agency through renunciation of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the accumulation of carved names building toward the clock's recalibration. The dominant stake—forcing acknowledgment of collective guilt—tightens as Elias moves from past grievances to his own confession. Cost is visible in his anticipated exile, though the middle lacks a decisive tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Each unknotted thread escalates pressure—from released breath to drowned man's scent to chorus of voices—culminating in the revelation that transforms Elias's understanding of his role. The cost is legible in his acceptance of becoming the widow's confessor rather than just a gardener, though the stakes could tighten more sharply through the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: initial hesitation, the dot becoming veins of silver, the map taking form as her hand surrenders control, culminating in the spire's song that validates her approach. The dominant stake—whether the future will accept her "groundedly imaginative" intervention—tightens when she fears overstepping. Cost manifests in her physical state and philosophical surrender of control.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring stories to a censored world—intensifies through Lira's arrival, which forces Elias from solitary broadcaster to active teacher. The Ministry's executions establish real danger, and the dust beginning to "sing" shows escalation. However, Elias's disappearance lacks agency—it happens to him rather than through his choice, weakening the closure's earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving art's mystery against understanding's destructive clarity—establishes early and deepens through the burned portrait revelation. While pressure accumulates through philosophical density, the conflict remains largely internal without significant external complication or reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal preservation to existential witness as Veyra's warning ("They'll flood the lower levels") creates a ticking clock. Elias's shift from hoarding artifacts to standing in the tunnel's mouth with the cog represents agency through renunciation. The foreman's line "History's written by the dry" crystallizes the cost of his choice.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving art against hatred's unlearning—tightens through reduction (twenty to four voices) with visible cost. The shift from trying to "braid into harmony" to accepting "negative space where music used to be" effectively narrows options. Slightly limited by the lack of active opposition in the present scene, though the accumulated losses provide sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal healing to community transformation. The dominant stake (Elias's relationship with his gift) deepens through discovery, experimentation, and choice to feed others despite criticism. Cost is visible in sacrificing professional recognition. Could strengthen the middle pressure point where he decides to cook with the fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—restoring wonder to a routinized city—escalates from personal doubt through the seed-planting to community transformation. The cost is legible in giving up the heirloom seed and accepting the engineers' coming disbelief, though the middle section could tighten pressure between discovery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding what makes houses feel alive—intensifies through Liora's ritual arrangement, the bay's response ("the water's ripple stilled"), and the mysterious voice acknowledging her proximity. The cost manifests in her relinquishing the orris shard, accepting that understanding requires release rather than possession, though the opposition remains entirely internal/mystical without external pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulating truths that narrow the human's options: first the city's true nature, then the poison's actual target, finally the city's waiting purpose. Each revelation forces recalibration until the human must choose between mission and truth, with the helmet removal as irreversible commitment. Cost is visceral in the drowning/transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation occurs through accumulation: the chipped die's stuttering roll reveals the loop's flaw, forcing Lena's choice between revision and acceptance. The cost manifests in her deliberate return to climbing after glimpsing escape. One meaningful deepening that reweights the entire premise.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from painting on dying leaves to the tree shuddering and producing new growth, to the painter finally yielding to sleep after forty-three nights. The cost is embodied in his exhaustion and the worn brush tip suggesting mysterious continuation. The dominant stake - proving kindness persists among strangers - faces its test when the leaf vanishes but evidence remains.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from preserving a single craft (beekeeping) to recognizing systemic cultural absorption, with Liora's lens-shattering creating irreversible cost. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens as discoveries deepen understanding, though the middle section with the baker could generate more friction before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the yoyo's activation revealing the hunger stones' true nature as "a map" not "a warning," with Elias's agency driving the transformation. The cost is legible in "clocks began running backward" and the world being "lighter without him" - though the tightening could be slightly more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—confronting what "wears your face"—escalates through Lysander's physical journey deeper into the funhouse and culminates in the decisive act of pulling the filmstrip from the doppelganger. The cost manifests in his transformation ("the clasp at his throat now held a new kind of hunger"). While pressure coheres under the textural lens, the confrontation itself feels slightly rushed, with the resolution arriving through a single gesture rather than accumulated struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming storm resistance into rhythm—escalates through each strike creating increasingly complex cloud responses. The sea's unexpected voice deepens the conflict meaningfully. Cost is visible in the referenced split mast and current uncertainty, though the protagonist's agency could be more decisively tested before the final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through pattern accumulation: from decoding silence to the whistle's call, the watchers' approach, and finally Elyas stepping forward as the gate screams. The dominant stake—understanding what the watchers want—tightens as each revelation (expedition taken, gate's twin, invitation not threat) narrows Elyas's options toward his final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from discovery to confrontation to revelation, with Elias's choice to reveal the parallel documents rather than flee showing agency under pressure. The cost is legible (career, safety, Church's pursuit). Slight deduction as Callahan's physical lunge feels abrupt after verbal sparring.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under Accumulative lens: pressure builds through discoveries that deepen Elias's commitment despite personal cost (lost marriage, professional mockery). The dominant stake—whether connection across time justifies present sacrifice—tightens when he finds the Keeper's validation. However, the middle lacks a clear tightening moment where options narrow or costs escalate before the final archive scene.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the stamp to discovering coordinates to finding his own name prophetically recorded, each revelation tightening options. The blackout deadline creates time pressure ("Surface teams would restore power soon"). However, the final choice to continue his work lacks the sharp cost or visible trade-off needed for higher bands—we understand intellectually but don't feel the price of his decision.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief to existential transformation as the gem "bit down" and the protagonist must choose dissolution. The isle's sinking-through-not-into creates persistent pressure, with meaningful deepening when she understands "the isle wasn't sinking. It was unfolding."

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief to actively manipulating reality's fabric, with the scientists' warnings creating external pressure. The cost materializes when Lena destroys the observatory's systems and isolates herself in darkness. Slight deduction because the middle section's "perturbation theory as knife" metaphor doesn't fully translate to concrete escalation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.6)
    Central tension between isolation and connection escalates through the chip theft to shared revelation. The stakes deepen when "the frequency wasn't a sound. It was a shape." Cost appears in relinquishing individual possession for shared understanding, though the pilgrim's easy acceptance reduces friction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure builds through accumulation—from passive guilt-carrying to active disposal of the watch hand, triggering the driftwood's revelation. The stake (confronting truth about Harkin) tightens when tomorrow's date forces immediate decision. However, escalation relies heavily on coincidence (the driftwood splitting) rather than protagonist agency, limiting the score despite felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on the boy's fate with clear escalation from refusal to negotiation to acceptance. The supply cache trade creates genuine pressure with cost visible in Kaelis's hesitation and the boy's physical state. The chasm's depth metaphor ("where forgiveness and apology both drowned") effectively heightens emotional stakes. Missing deeper complication or reversal limits score.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (reconciliation vs. escape) is clear early and tightens when Elias reads the first letter. Agency manifests through his decision to stay. However, escalation relies heavily on internal reflection rather than present-scene pressure, and the conflict lacks a meaningful middle tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—choosing empathy versus remaining hollow—escalates through the lake's test and culminates in facing the victim. The baseball throw creating a path represents meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens, though the fantastical turn briefly diffuses realistic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from the stag's request through two failed resurrection attempts to Liora's acceptance of transformation. Each spice ritual deepens the cost—first seeing her brother's ghost, then burning contact, finally her own metamorphosis. The fortune cookie's prophecy ("You will become what you seek") creates anticipatory pressure that pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as Liora traces the crack, summons her brother, and confronts twenty years of hoarded grief. The cost manifests in the shattering saucer and forced release. Agency shows in her choice to "repent for time." Slightly lower score as the brother's appearance feels somewhat convenient despite the magical realism frame.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate through three stitching attempts: thread snaps, then holds, then opens the tear fully. Each failure adds pressure—the photograph warms, gravity flickers more violently, the AI activates with urgency. The child's impossible laugh and reaching hands raise emotional stakes perfectly. Cost is legible in Lien's unraveling and the Eulogy's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: from distributing hope to fulfilling prophecy to physical transformation. The tide's retreat creates genuine urgency, and throwing the vials into lava shows clear cost. The "trade light for fire" fulfillment feels slightly predetermined rather than fully earned through pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear - expose the fort's crimes and arm the villagers - with escalation through the hatch to armory sequence. However, Kael faces no real opposition or complication; everything proceeds exactly as planned, reducing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: painted rocks trembling → dust burning through skin → eels returning transformed → accepting eternal duty. The cost crystallizes in Liora's bodily integration with the dust ("settled into her bones") and isolation as the last friction-bearer.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: storm approaching → poem revealed → ink bleeding → tearing → release, with each beat narrowing Elias's options. The cost is legible in the destroyed poem and years of suppressed expression, though the internal nature of conflict limits visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from philosophical debate to physical duel to partnership negotiation, with each thrust carrying diplomatic weight. The needle card's trajectory, the sundial strike revealing the hidden key, and the decision to abandon the Council verdict all tighten options with visible cost. The "real answer had been here all along" pays off the three-day wait.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (preserving beauty/meaning against destruction) intensifies through Maren's arrival with smuggled books and the revelation of shared purpose. The itch to leave versus the pull to stay creates genuine tension. However, the guards remain an abstract future threat rather than present pressure, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through Lena's shift from passive waiting to active creation of the path, with the compasses "shuddering" and "locking in unison" marking genuine intensification. The cost manifests in the projector burning out and years spent, though the lover's easy presence at the end slightly deflates the earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from protecting memory to sacrificing identity, with the seed forcing an irreversible trade-off. The revelation that "dreams weren't echoes...the island itself, trying to remember her" effectively reweights the conflict. Cost is visible in the transformation sequence and villagers' dawn discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from physical loss ("brother's name carved into the tide charts as *lost*") through the compass bleeding color to the final act of planting it with the bonsai. The cost remains consistent—the brother stays dead—while Elias's agency shifts from passive grief to active cultivation, though pressure could tighten more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by the protagonist's agency under the Accumulative lens: the photographs' disintegration forces a reactive choice. The cost of her act is felt in the garden's groan and her physical collapse. The dominant stake of being trapped in "when" is tested and reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (planting seeds for resilience) is signaled early and tightens through the guard encounter, forcing a tactical choice (lure with poppy seeds, trap with piano). Agency drives escalation under the Causal lens: her actions directly narrow options and raise cost (time risk). The cost is legible on the page (shouts fading, hands stained). No coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens, culminating in the forge's ignition and the final imprint. The cost is legible as the greenhouse floods and the wrecks settle. A single, meaningful intensification is sufficient for this length, though the stakes are more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the causal lens; her unlocking the case tightens options, leading to the mirror's revelation and the stationmaster's confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (proving existence/identity) is signaled early. Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: decrypting the cast message and using the shell as a weapon narrow options and lead to the ledger. Cost is visible (blood on shell) and alters tactics. One meaningful tightening (from hiding to active pursuit) is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Eldrin's agency under the accumulative lens, his act of retelling deepening the silence's weight until it necessitates his dissolution. The cost is unmistakable: the loss of the booklet and his own form. The dominant stake (mapping the night) tightens through a single meaningful cadence shift into erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate through density increases and pattern breaks under the Accumulative lens. The dominant stake (seeking origin of thought) tightens meaningfully with each violin note, culminating in a closure that reweights all prior material with palpable cost. Protagonist agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by Lena's agency under the Accumulative lens: her choice to listen, then to draw, then to slide the ticket across the desk. Each action deepens the stakes of silent communication, narrowing her options and culminating in a clear, felt cost—her personal reconfiguration. The pressure is coherent and intensifies to the final, quiet beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (non-argument, deliberate reveal) under Accumulative lens. Single meaningful deepening (elders witnessing garden's choice) reweights stakes with cost (crushed shoots). Persistent constraint (pragmatism) narrows options until repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification: the pull of the lever warps reality, forcing the climax. The dominant stake—proving time is nonlinear—is signaled early and tested concretely by the AI's warnings and the physical strain on the station. The cost is legible in the flatlining of K-11's vitals and the AI's protocol violation count, making the trade-off undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, moving from passive observation to active investigation. The dominant stake (unraveling the code) tightens with the ghost's direct instruction, forcing a tactical choice to retrieve the key. The cost is unmistakable: the dissolution of the liminal space that facilitated their connection, foreclosing that path.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Liora's agency under the accumulative lens—her decision to withhold the truth tightens the stakes until she accepts the storm's inevitability. The cost is legible in her dissolution of weight and vanishing footprints, foreclosing her old path of silent endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by agency under Accumulative lens: Elias's deliberate acts (listening to wheel, destroying radio, turning valve) intensify pressure. Cost is legible: the wheel becomes "lighter" after exhaling its secret, and Elias accepts a new "shift" with visible endurance. One meaningful tightening (valve turn) forces a trade-off between proof and burden.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a single, decisive intensification: the keeper's entry into the refuge and subsequent dissolution. The dominant stake of enduring to witness is tested and crystallizes into a final, cost-heavy stance. The price of their choice is felt in their blurred edges and the library's patient consumption of them.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure escalates through a decisive cadence shift (the eclipse) that forces a stance crystallization. Elias's agency in pressing the vial into Mira's palm is the key turn that narrows options and leads to the payoff. The cost is felt in Lila's half-laugh, half-sob and Mira's tears of wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift: the axis moves, the world tilts. This reweights the dominant stake (understanding the displacement) with a clear cost—the destruction of the diaries.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency under the accumulative lens: Elias's choice to lunge and merge is the decisive tightening. The cost is unmistakable (searing pain, loss of the tablet). The dominant stake (conquering the fractured self) is signaled early and pays off with a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by Accumulative pressure—the density of sensory details and emotional weight deepens the stake of defeating numbness.

The cost is the shattering of his lifelong integrity of solitude, forcing him into a new, uncertain stance.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency in uncorking the vial, a choice that deepens his knowledge and radically reweights the dominant stake under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: how to proceed after the fire and the brother’s implication. The key tightening is the handwriting reveal, which deepens personal cost and sets up the renunciation of the ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens: failure at the key, then a risky pivot through the heat‑map that demands bodily price and culminates in a stance—go back into the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—granting rest—tightens via the lens’s call and the ascent to the lighthouse, culminating in the stillness pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)

    Dominant stake (steal the “portrait” vs. fate) tightens when the stationmaster enters with the gun and declares her luck is ending, forcing a decisive act. The reversal—that the portrait is a mirror of luck—deepens pressure rather than soft-resolving it, and her choice to break it forecloses a path.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—risking collapse to create a true safe zone—is signaled early and tightens with the discovery of “controlled collapse.” The meaningful turn is the final valve pull; the price is the intentional flooding and her refusal to watch, foreclosing the refuge of nostalgia.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)

A sharper tangible risk (structural failure, irretrievable loss named on page) would intensify the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)

Slight distance remains regarding what, beyond self‑cost, is lost by not broadcasting, keeping it just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes concentrate around confronting/containing the truth; pressure coheres from atmospheric unease to physical escalation (ripples, voice distortions) to a decisive act.

The price is conceptual and emotional rather than physical, but it reads.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres as a deepening rather than a contest: the keeper’s endurance is tested by the refuge’s temporal/ontological pull.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—what to do with the charged rope/pattern—tightens through the pendulum beat and the decision to pull until it snaps.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (prevent temporal collapse by finding/controlling the echo) is signaled early and tightens through tangible acts.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and tightens: tracing patterns → dovetailing eyes → prism/mist → almost‑apparition → dissolution → acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure deepens via pattern density: trembling leaves → cellular metamorphosis → storm intensification → decisive act of removing supports.

The price is vulnerability and a redefinition of her craft, felt in the relinquishment of the tile and the choice to leave the lens unfocused. Slightly more resistance or counter‑pressure in the middle would heighten the pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (will he surrender the anchor and risk unmaking?) tightens cleanly at the corridor’s opening and crystallizes at the drop. The cost is clear though relatively gentle—transformation over harm. Agency drives the turn; pressure remains coherent and focused.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens from private repair to imminent discovery (door creak, sirens) and a moral trade recalculated under the clock. The decisive turn—the pot’s shattering—both escalates stakes and forecloses the ledger path, forcing flight. The cost is ongoing and specific, not abstract. One more concrete consequence on the refugees’ side might have intensified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—catching and rendering time’s textures—tightens with the “different” hum leading to Elara’s name and a night-long transcription. The deepening is clear, if understated, and culminates in renewed commitment over daily life. The price and narrowing of options are present but muted; no hard reversal, but pressure coheres under the accumulative lens. Tension is chiefly tonal and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure intensifies via accumulation: ghost rumors → 47‑B listening → sleeplessness/offerings → ledger with his name → flooding tide → sacrifice. The tightening forecloses a path—reclaiming “Daniel”—for an endurance/renunciation stance. Stakes remain mostly internal and conceptual; cost is felt but not cruelly exacted. Still, one clear escalation and tradeoff are legible under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding the “universal riddle” before it slips away—is clear and tightened by the dissolving journal and the last page tearing free. The escalation is accumulative: sound deepens from hum to conversation to chorus, forcing a stance shift. Agency drives resolution; he renounces catching the past and commits to adding to it, with the price of relinquishing the map. Tension operates at image and scene scales without false dramatics.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve Lumina’s fluidity against the developers’ grids before dawn. Escalation accrues through denser action—hand-with-stone map, clocktower/sundial gambit, and the culminating embedding of the chip—tightening stance rather than delivering a hard reversal. The visible price is more conceptual than concrete on the page; risk and potential betrayal are implied but not cashed. Still, agency drives the end and coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve what machines will erase—tightens via the timed pulses and audible approach of drones. The escalation is quiet but real; dawn’s “knife-edge” and the third glow tie his endurance to a clock, narrowing options to witness or flee. The cost is acceptance rather than confrontation, earned by the design of the canister as a message against inevitability. A strong deepening without a major reversal suits the piece’s chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preventing a flawed maiden voyage—is clear and tightens as the anchor locks and the crowd swells. Escalation is modest because resistance is low and the patch works on the first attempt. The time pressure is present but gentle. The earned resolution stems from Elias’s agency, though cost clarity remains muted.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (discover/accept the source) tightens as the condensation points NNW, the lake “stillness” condition is met, and the voice asserts her role. The key escalation is her offering the page, which narrows options and triggers a world‑level consequence (a river reverses). The cost is quiet but legible: she abandons the mapped world for the unmapped. Pressure is coherent, though not blistering.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (revival before surrender/collapse) tightens via the archway’s groan and the admonition “You’re late,” prompting adaptation (he quickens, persists). The price is endurance—time, stamina, and a life pledged to maintenance. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the accumulative lens; one meaningful deepening is achieved. A sharper on-page trade-off or near-failure beat could raise pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (redeeming/rewriting the self via the hush before air runs out) is signaled early and tightens when the signal dies and the hush gathers. The decisive act—uncorking the vial and surrendering—forecloses the path of continued answering. Cost is legible in the renunciation and the lingering hush, though external resistance is more atmospheric than antagonistic. Pressure coheres under the chosen lens without gimmicks.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (recovering/rewriting the father’s name) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully with the whispers, the beam catching him, and “they are coming.” The decisive act—plucking the name—narrows options and forces a hasty escape. Prices are present but soft (risk of capture; downstream deaths found at noon), which slightly blunts the felt crunch of the peak beat. Tension scales at sentence and beat levels without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens: each “ghosting” costs Liora more, culminating in the tree’s rupture and her unraveling. Agency drives escalation (her clawing back through resonance); the keeper’s push (“You’re lovingly venomous”) frames resource pressure. The price is unmistakable at the peak. Slight softness in on‑page dilemma (no competing choice) keeps it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reweaving ruin into something sacred—tightens at the Heart Chamber when external reality responds, converting wandering into agency. The escalation is a single decisive intensification consistent with the chosen lens. Cost registers conceptually (ending sleepbound safety; bodily ache) but remains gentle. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres from world and conscience.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can he coax life/faith back—is clear and tightens via discovery and planting to the sapling’s emergence. Escalation is primarily textural, with one decisive intensification at the crack/new growth. The visible price is modest (isolation, descent), with no explicit foreclosed option or loss to sharpen the turn. Still, agency drives the key beats rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure coheres around whether to commit the chosen name and accept the loss of control; the hesitation before the mailbox is the clearest tightening. The felt price is primarily conceptual, which lands but remains low‑heat. No reversals beyond that single cadence shift; still adequate for this length and lens. A slightly sharper external nudge could have heightened the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. the Council’s control) is clear early and tightens with the dawn deadline, the broadcast, and the early arrival of enforcers. Elias’s agency escalates pressure by choosing to synchronize and broadcast instead of fleeing, paying with the observatory’s loss. Stakes feel present, not abstract, at the climax. The piece could show one more beat of tangible risk before the shattering to intensify cost, but the cadence still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to speak or release—tightens through two decisive attempts at evoked words and culminates in letting the letter go. The spirits’ question crystalizes pressure and forces stance. The cost is present but more conceptual than visceral, keeping the escalation strong but not searing. No coincidence resolves anything; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she translate/graft meaning under fresh pressure—tightens when the boy asks for help, forcing her to act and relinquish the coral. The escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens; her renunciation registers as the visible price. External and internal conflicts braid (body pain, history, present need) without melodrama. A clearer threat of failure or a sharper trade‑off would intensify stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes center on rekindling communal joy, with one decisive tightening at the dusk display. The pressure is gentle, but the move from solitary experiment to public risk is a credible escalation that narrows options. Cost is present via impermanence (the film fading) and the implied risk of failure, though direct resistance is minimal. The absence of an on‑page antagonist keeps tension low but coherent for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—trading certainty for curiosity—tightens with each cycle: found nickel → first crossing → second mural blank → she paints a door. The visible cost is leaving her known life; the garden keeps her, and she “never returned.” Escalation is accumulative rather than reversal-driven but still narrows options credibly. Minor softness: external pressure is minimal; tension rests mainly on stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (evading cognitive taxation by re‑encoding language) is signaled early and tightens through the warning bloom and auditors’ uprootings. Escalation is accumulative rather than confrontational, but the reversal “they know” forces a tactical caution choice (rosemary). The final “now” compresses options into action with credible risk. The felt price is more environmental and systemic than personal on the page, keeping it just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmuting war‑rot into sustenance—tightens via the ghost’s accusation, the new war’s throbbing drums, and her decision to sing louder. The escalation is accumulative: density and scope increase (lullabies to seeds to net snaring the sun). Costs are felt (self‑expenditure, sleepless centuries) and options narrow toward endurance and making. Resolution is earned by her stance crystallization rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens from gentle curation to existential threat when the name reanimates the hall; the choice to break the chime forecloses her life’s aim. Stakes stay coherent (preserve vs. release) and escalate via her own actions. Cost is felt in the ruin and loss of vocation. The single meaningful tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve/restore truth‑binding language before destruction—is signaled early and tightened by a live clock. Escalation arrives with the ink’s bruise‑revelations and the emissaries at the gate, forcing the risky singing act. Agency drives the turn; consequences alter the field (no ashes to burn, ongoing burden of the shard). The price is more conceptual than bodily, but it’s felt.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are singular and legible: rebuild hard gates for praise or champion hidden sluices and risk censure. Escalation tightens from private deciphering to public declaration, and the choice forecloses the compliant path. The ethical calculus (“strength via yielding”) is sharpened in the elders’ chamber. The opposition yields quickly, muting the felt price and limiting escalation’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether he will risk trust/music—intensifies via the letter and the act of sending the pigeon, then tightens during the night watch. The return note reweights options, earning a modest but clear escalation. The cost is emotionally legible but remains quiet rather than sharply tested.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (find Liora vs. honor the threshold) is signaled early and deepened when “The center isn’t the middle” reframes the search. The key tightening forces a trade‑off: extract the child or accept her crossing; he chooses the latter at a cost. Tension operates across beats without an antagonist, coherently under the chosen lens. Slight softness in concrete risk keeps it just below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the approaching peak of respite, the shared exhale, and the transient convergence with Kael. The meaningful tightening is their contact—then the price: separation at sunrise and her chosen ongoing solitude below. Stakes are intimate (belonging) rather than survivalist, but they are made concrete by the live clock and environment. The escalation is modest yet sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (“before memory fades”) is live and tightened by the bird’s “hurry” and “Time was a thief here.” The escalation is a textural deepening: seed pulses, map recognition, cut and blood reveal, then the decision to accept the influx of memories. Cost and consequence register (weight, relinquishing the old uncertainty). Pressure is coherent and grows, though a sharper on‑page dilemma could elevate tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on orchestrating a precise moment; escalation is a controlled increase in density culminating in the torch flicker and collective gasp. Agency is attention and timing under pressure, not coincidence. The cost is a chosen solitude and eschewed transactional success. A sharper on‑page trade‑off would deepen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internally coherent: can she transform by choosing sky/silence over sea/song. Pressure tightens as method demands gaps; the heron’s vanishing crystallizes the cost of entering absence, and the dust’s hunger raises immediacy. The decisive act (completing the verse) forecloses the option of return. A touch more concrete jeopardy or counterforce in-scene could have sharpened the trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: preserve meaning against erasure before the harbor wakes. Escalation is textural—the mist thickens, ripples read, the prism set, the boat appears—tightening into a single cadence shift. The cost is a continued solitude and recommitment in the face of forgetting. While there’s no hard reversal, the turn to “day began” reweights options credibly within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to reconnect without cutting—tightens through reseeing the cracks as veins and culminates in the costly send-and-leave. The escalation is a deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate at this length, and led by his agency. The renunciation forecloses the path of safe isolation and talismanic hoarding. Pressure remains coherent; no luck-based resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on whether Liora can reconfigure hope from altitude to potential; escalation arrives via the gauge’s behavior, the revitalization turn, and the glass cracking. The tightening is thematic rather than adversarial, with agency in attention and arrangement rather than contest. The price—abandoning fixed inscription to the tide—is clear but not punishing. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reconciling legacy—tightens when the hum differs and the negative reveals his mother’s eyes, compelling the door-opening. The escalation is internal/external braid: chorus of echoes and shrine tableau force him to reframe his craft at cost to his old identity. While the price is more emotional than physical, it’s legible in the long night of sketching and the weight-to-thread reframing. One decisive deepening is present; no antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (give the mother a possibility at a cost) is activated early and tightens as the bells near. The tangible price—stealing and then unraveling a heartbeat, choosing not to look—narrows options and enacts a renunciation. No major reversal, but the cadence shift at first bell → last bell reads as a meaningful deepening. Pressure stays coherent and internal/external beats interlock.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: will Kael sign and what does that cost mean. Tightening occurs when Veyra invokes his earlier words—a turn that narrows his options and forces a trade‑off between pride and the possibility of “mornings.” The visible price is his reluctant humanization and her acceptance of likely failure. Escalation remains quiet but firm, fitting the scene’s situational frame.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—what to do with the last egg—tightens through the storm’s encroaching thunder and the map‑like fissures leading to a “cradle.” The reversal is quiet but decisive: from hoarding/engineering absence to relinquishing and memorializing. Price is internal and conceptual rather than survivalist, yet it sharpens the end. A slightly stronger on‑page consequence would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing the echoes versus the safety of silence—is active from the start and intensifies through the three-knot sequence. Each untangling escalates pressure (resistance, ominous warning, physical shudder) and narrows options. The final tightening—absorbing the echoes and the gates snapping—carries a visible price. A sliver more resistance or risk of failure in the middle beat could sharpen the turn further.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent (ethics of manipulation vs. responsibility after harm) and tighten through a single decisive deepening when he chooses to show seams. The miner’s disruption is offstage but effectively pressurizes the present. The cost—risking failure and surrendering mastery—is felt if understated. The escalation fits the accumulative lens: cadence shifts around the ember press and plan revision.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (honoring the forgotten) tightens via the gust and the visible unraveling—an on‑page intensification that reweights his stance. Agency is endurance and renunciation; he chooses fragility over permanence with a cost in loss and futility. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens. A sharper foreclosed alternative would amplify the price.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (how to preserve the names without freezing them) is clear and tightens when she chooses to reconfigure rather than archive. Escalation is a density build (hum → light → chorus → dissolution) culminating in an on‑page relinquishment. The price is emotional/ontological, not physical, but it’s unmistakable. Quiet pressure, effectively handled for the form.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible: will Lior assert control by interpreting, or be consumed by a path that chooses her. Escalation tightens coherently—the film’s divergence, the sentient vines, the terminal’s sacrifice demand, and the murals’ reconfiguration narrow her options toward renunciation. The price is conceptual but concrete on the page (loss of the crossroads, ash of the wafer). Slightly more on-page resistance at the final act would heighten the felt friction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding vs. risk/faith—is clear and tightens at the pillar and at the altar. The decisive deepening stems from Qishti’s agency: pressing the tile, stepping into the passage, and placing it on the altar foreclose alternatives. The cost is present but relatively gentle (conceptual shift, loss of the tile, latent danger), as overseer pressure doesn’t test him on the page. A single beat of direct jeopardy could have sharpened escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (reconciliation vs. self‑protective silence) are established early and tighten through the “grace” confrontation and the decisive act with the pin. Pressure coheres without external antagonist; the cost is relinquishing the grievance that has defined Lior. The single cadence shift (sound’s return and Kael’s solidity) is earned by Lior’s agency. Slight softness around external consequences keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (release/reunion across boundaries) is signaled early and coherently escalates as breathing reshapes metal, mirror reflects the past, and the brother’s voice pulls. The key tightening is the renunciation—“If boundaries were the problem, then erasure was the answer”—which narrows options and leads to crossing. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping tension refined rather than acute. No false turns; pressure is steady and deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding and repairing the bond—tightens meaningfully when the note reframes the search and the sprout answers, forcing a choice to rebind the ribbon and eat the forbidden fruit. Pressure is coherent and grows through discovery rather than confrontation, fitting the chosen lens. The price is modest but present (renunciation of old constraints, acceptance of the daughter’s terms). A sharper on-page counterforce could have intensified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure coheres around “to inquire or not, and how,” with a meaningful tightening when the mirror warns and the orchard presents divergent prior curator paths. The blossom‑to‑instruction and “Simply/Complicated” reversals reweight options without gimmickry. The cost is mostly conceptual (choosing a bounded, non‑totalizing engagement) rather than a concrete loss, tempering intensity. Nonetheless, agency drives resolution with a credible renunciation of extremes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reach the Library first) is signaled early and tightened at the name‑speaking beat, which narrows options by opening the door. Elias’s agency escalates pressure via manipulation and “renegotiation,” though the traveler’s leap delivers the physical culmination. Prices are explicit: the diary erased and a memory loss that forecloses future tactics. Tension runs clean without empty intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recover the erased twin—tightens through the ledger theft and the swatch’s use, culminating in restoration and the choice to help others. The escalation is more deepening than combative, but the stay/go moment produces a real narrowing of options. The visible price (sinking ship; responsibility to others) lands, albeit with limited opposition. A modest additional friction in-scene would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (how to handle the impossible archive) is signaled early and tightens via the ritual rope work and the ledger that can’t be grasped. The pivotal deepening—“Some things can’t be archived. Only merged.”—forces a trade‑off between professional ethos and lived entanglement. The cost (choosing to live, not record) is legible and charges the ending. Escalation is elegant and quiet rather than harrowing, which fits but slightly softens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (preserve the hush) is established early, with one meaningful tightening at the conjuring: the beings’ song falters, then reorients to harmony. Pressure coheres and deepens rather than reverses; the cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping stakes refined rather than raw. The fissure and recoil provide credible external pressure tied to Eldrin’s agency. The resolution feels earned and not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible and tight: rekindle the beacon to align meaning. Escalation arrives via a decisive intensification—the star paths lighting and the mending—to reweight options and knowledge. The price is primarily conceptual/emotional, not a concrete sacrifice, which slightly softens the felt squeeze. Still, the cadence shift at the flare is undeniable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to form identity—tightens from measuring to a river‑model acceptance. The decisive deepening is the shadow‑space touch leading to the offered future‑self memory, forcing a trade‑off between grasping and surrender. The cost is the renunciation of her lifelong tactic, with options reweighted toward listening. Quiet but unmistakable escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (defy the starless curse/hopelessness) is clear and escalates: climb → mosaic → ignition → world response. The meaningful tightening is Liora choosing to light the rag despite social pressure and unknown consequences. Price and risk are gestured at (villagers’ judgment, the hush, potential curse) but consequences don’t bite back directly on the page. Escalation feels earned, if gentler than the premise could allow.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to answer grief/fate—tightens through the accumulative method to a concrete price: she gives away the cicada. The meaningful deepening is the “shape of it” moment that reframes options and pushes the renunciation. Stakes are quiet but coherent; cost is visible. Slight softness: the fisherman’s on‑page counterpressure is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rejecting “safety” to claim transformation—tightens through the bloom’s hush (gilded palm) to the choice that forecloses return and costs the father. Escalation is protagonist‑driven at each turn: climb, take, unfold, depart. The “they’re coming” pressure adds external urgency without resolving anything by coincidence. Cost is unmistakable in the bunker’s collapse and the refused backward look.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around whether silence can comfort rather than accuse, tightening with the vial’s darkening and the intrusion of distant laughter. Elias’s adjustments constitute agency that reshapes the sonic field and the passenger’s burden distribution. The price remains conceptual/ongoing rather than a sharp foreclosure, so escalation feels elegantly muted rather than gripping. Still, a clear mid‑scene deepen and a closing stance crystallization are present.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (ascend vs. unmake), with a meaningful deepening when “sally forth, but not upward” flips the axis of pursuit. The reversal (refusing the helix) forecloses a path with a conceptual and personal price. Pressure is coherent under the causal lens, though escalation faces minimal resistance; the lock clicks open without meaningful complication. Still, the choice at the throne credibly narrows options and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes center on whether to maintain isolating stasis or release the gathered dead; pressure tightens when the shadow literalizes the debt and the ring becomes the lever. Escalation is quiet but unmistakable: signs → confrontation → act. The price of release is a profound relinquishment, not a reset. The conflict between want (silence) and need (letting go) interlocks cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—accept the loop/promise or break/bend it—and tightens via the escalating messages to the decisive “Turn it” moment. The cost is legible: blood, the farm’s extinguishing constellations, and the path foreclosed by ignoring the final buzz. The agency is Lina’s; coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve. Slightly swift resolution after the main turn keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: will he access and interpret the family’s truth. Escalation is a steady deepening (letters → floorboard → mirror → tuning), with a meaningful tightening when his reflection corrects his approach. The price is internal and modest, so the felt risk remains contemplative rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain bound by performance or reclaim agency—tightens when threads manacle his wrists, forcing a single tactic: unsnap and speak. The escalation is protagonist-driven; the price is tangible (breaking the welded gauntlet, releasing shadows, ending seven years of silence). Pressure remains coherent and deepens rather than reverses. Slight abstraction of external consequences keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres around whether Elias will remain a passive custodian or act to reconnect a severed lineage. The escalation is gentle but real: curiosity to research, then the mail choice that risks overstepping. The visible price is more ethical/emotional than practical, keeping the piece quiet but earned. One meaningful tightening occurs with the research reveal and the irrevocable act of mailing.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (resisting erasure) is signaled early and tightens with “moving the last archive tomorrow.” Agency drives turns (unlocking, targeting the archive, later leaving the key), but the central confrontation occurs off‑page with consequences reported after. The price is credible yet mostly conceptual on the page; a single on‑scene friction spike would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is tight (contain the prophecy); escalation deepens as the environment resists (mist thickens, face in prism) and he chooses surrender‑level quiet as tactic. The visible price is endurance and return—an earned stasis rather than triumph. Internal and external threads braid well, though a sharper on‑page trade‑off could heighten the peak. Still, agency drives the turns and the cost carries into the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—decoding/guardianship—tightens as the monuments animate and the arbor answers, forcing Liora to commit (climb, then leap) with bodily and vocational cost. Escalation is primarily deepening rather than adversarial, apt for the lens. The “prod” actions serve as decisive triggers. Pressure could read stronger with a moment of risk or competing claim, but the cadence shift suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is internal—permission to stop compulsive fixing—tightened by the waterfall’s question and the ledger’s command, culminating in a renunciation. The decisive act (repurposing the gear, then refusing the clock) forecloses a prior path with cost. Pressure deepens coherently rather than through overt antagonism. Slight ceiling: external risks remain muted, keeping the escalation subtle rather than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Liora will embrace the risk and meaning of Veyra’s work—tightens decisively at the coin‑to‑crucible commitment. The explicit risk (“reduce her to ash”) and the private, post‑search‑party window heighten pressure. Escalation is internal and coherent, though outcomes come with little resistance once she commits, softening peak tension. Still, agency drives the turn and the cost is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes and pressure are gentle but coherent: can she reframe this soul’s end through joy rather than release? Escalation arrives via tactic change (petals and joke) and the risk of inviting humor into grief. The cost remains mostly tonal and conceptual; no option is decisively foreclosed on the page. Still, the tightening to a chorus of laughter reads as a clear deepening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming self and stance toward mercy—tightens through one decisive turn: choosing to engage the basin’s ripping vision despite pain. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens: pressure intensifies from sensory overwhelm to ritual exposure (pillars singing “in pressure”). The cost is tangible (penance through pain, the strap snapping, a renunciation of “answers”). Resolution grows from Liran’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (find an anchor/Elara’s trace) is signaled early and meaningfully tightens when the hidden name appears and the lens reveals the log. The decisive deepening occurs at the fitting of the lens, which reconfigures options and compels the final following. Prices are conceptual (erasure of the painting; self‑redefinition) rather than visceral, keeping pressure refined but coherent for the chosen lens. A touch more friction or risk in the act would heighten cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: from flicker and waiting to the pattern resolving, to the vault‑like reveal, to a moral trade—repair versus release. The decisive tightening is the recognition that “cracks are seams,” which redefines stakes and compels renunciation. Cost is visible (child’s laugh shatters; mechanism stilled), and the ghosts’ stillness amplifies risk before the turn. A brief added resistance or complication during the unmaking could raise tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—stabilize a rupturing reality vs. embrace fall/awakening—tightens through the press sequence and flips when the rupture is internalized as self. The decision to unstopper/print raises cost; the acceptance of dissolution forecloses a life‑defining path. Tension escalates in image density and consequence, consistent with the lens. A slightly earlier on‑page articulation of what “failure” would entail could heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—wresting the Republic’s legacy from reductive archaeology—is clear and tightens as Elias escalates from theory to risky demonstration. The vision’s three‑breath restoration is a decisive intensification, and the price (sacrificed shard) is unmistakable. Pressure is protagonist‑driven; Taelis’s arrival adds direct external heat. Slightly soft moral calculus (the dispute ends quickly) keeps it just under the top.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (whether to “give back the lie” at personal cost) surfaces early and tightens through one meaningful turn: Elias stops trying to fix and chooses reclamation. The price compounds on the page—first his honesty, then the music box, then his body—before the final burn. Pressure grows coherently from hunger to demand to surrender, with agency driving each step. Consequences are not hand‑waved; they reconfigure the city and erase Elias.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will he force an answer or accept the hinge—tightens when he touches the arch and is suspended, then reverses into refusal. The cost (ending the quest, burning notes) is legible and scaled to the form. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the single intensification is sufficient for this length. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding a way back from being marooned—tightens when GPS dies and the storm escalates, leading to a single meaningful deepening via the loom insight and carving. Agency drives resolution; coincidence doesn’t solve it. Cost is felt (forfeiting the slide; leaving his work behind), though physical peril is kept lyrical more than visceral. A shade more pressure or a clearer foreclosed alternative could raise the voltage.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure builds texturally toward a single deepening: the window’s hidden layer reframes the stake from “why night?” to “how to listen.” Agency is a renunciation (not painting, leaving) with a visible price, appropriate at this scale. Stakes remain internal but coherent and tighten at the shiver/reveal beat. No antagonist is needed under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve/erase/release truth—tightens when the Revision Board arrives with burn barrels, forcing the parley choice. The debris‑code is a decisive tactic that averts immediate destruction and narrows options to a moral trade‑off. The cost is real though not lethal: loss of the artifact and a redefinition of professional identity. Slightly soft on physical jeopardy, but ethical pressure is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (revival vs. emptiness) is clear, and escalation arrives as a density increase the protagonist must sustain. The key tightening is his decision to hold the vision through doubt and then to discard the bottle, narrowing options to labor over magic. Pressure is felt but largely internal; opposition is minimal, so the cost reads more as endurance than sacrifice. Effective, if not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve emotional patterns without hubris. Pressure coheres as the prophecy emerges and reweights his oath, culminating in the refusal to archive prophecy and the burial plan—an on‑page cost. Escalation is quiet but decisive under the chosen lens, with a meaningful narrowing of options at “You are the hinge.” Stakes remain intimate yet legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early (resist the vortex, preserve the seeds) and pressure coheres as the vortex wakes/howls and ice fractures. The meaningful tightening arrives when she must act now—plant the seed and “push”—with the environment literally breaking around her. Cost is present (risk, expending the last heirloom) though the restorative ending softens it. Resolution is earned by her specific agency and method.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (valley’s warning) is clear; pressure escalates when the aftertone flaw appears under a strict deadline. Elias’s rebind is a decisive, risk‑colored adaptation that narrows options. The storm’s arrival validates the choice without deus ex machina. The on‑page price is more implicit than felt as loss, keeping the ceiling just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—risking self/protocol to connect—is signaled early and tightens with the star’s pause and the alarms. The meaningful turn is Eli’s refusal to retreat when warned, choosing permeability; consequence is the station’s transformation and his departure. The price is implied (risk of damage/job abandonment) but could be sharpened on the page. Tension remains coherent and grows through cadence rather than adversarial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes center on whether he will break the sealed covenant of silence; the pressure coheres as ghosts escalate from presence to activating the seam. His agency (the deliberate breath and lift) triggers the turn; cost is the relinquishment of hoarded silence and, ultimately, himself. Escalation is quiet but decisive under the chosen lens. A slightly clearer pre-open risk could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to reengage with fractured time—tightens via the pattern of discoveries toward the decision to wind the watch. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than adversarial pressure, but it coheres under the chosen lens. The price is mainly conceptual (embracing a perilous craft amid scarcity of time) and could be made more viscerally unavoidable on the page. Agency drives the ending rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can he make the poem alive without finishing it—tightens through the kite’s snap and the choice to retrieve and then tie it loosely as a sign of temporary bonds. Escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens. The visible prices (wet trousers, refused inscription, loose knot) are subtle yet felt. A clear deepening, not a dramatic reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes—devotion to living systems vs. dogmatic symmetry in the shadow of mortality—are clear from the outset. Escalation is quiet but real: elders demand uprooting; Elira chooses to bind and teach, accepting the time cost she cannot afford. The night whispering and dawn tableau tighten pressure into an earned stasis; the price (her life) is unmistakable. It remains a lyric deepening rather than a sharp reversal, but the narrowing is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (accept/decline the “pilgrimage”) tightens via terminal prompts and the figure’s arrival; the “key” realization deepens options into an irreversible choice. The warning (“Most never come back”) crystallizes the price. Agency drives the turn: she refuses to answer, touches the galaxy, then commits by taking the hand. The escalation is coherent and avoids coincidence-as-solution.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular (land’s reclamation) and pressure coheres through a textural tightening: pockets empty, refusal to witness, trust over proof. The main turn is a cadence shift into renunciation and deferred payoff. On‑page price is modest but present (choosing trust and anonymity; returning tomorrow with darker seeds). A more acute present-tense test would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—bridge the wound of distance—tightens as the riddle becomes a map, then a door that exacts a price. The key tightening is at the fissure/dome: the option to remain outside forecloses when he presses the leaf and is pulled in. The cost (self‑surrender, possible death/transform) is legible in the sealing dome. Pressure is atmospheric more than antagonistic, but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes cohere around whether to remain in static survival or risk reorienting toward “Home.” Pressure tightens through the anomaly’s expansion in time, the compass warming, and the alarm’s chime, each narrowing hesitation until the alignment forces a leap. The price is palpable: solitude exchanged for unknown transit, tradition reinterpreted at personal risk. Escalation is protagonist‑driven rather than coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (retrieve/restore the lid to amend a broken sky/time) is signaled and tightened by the Keeper’s emergence and the name reveal. The reversal/tightening arrives when he lifts the piece and chooses to hand over the lid. Tension is elegant but gentle; danger feels abstracted, and consequences for failure are more implied than pressed. The on‑page price is modest, keeping escalation strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are unified: can memory survive the devourer. Pressure coheres as the penumbra stirs, then lunges; escalation meets agency when she chooses “release,” producing wings the dark cannot digest. The price is a renunciation of story in favor of silence—subtle but felt. Slight abstraction in the confrontation keeps it just shy of maximal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (whether to claim the buried talent) tightens as discovery reframes the quest from key to mirror to planting. Agency drives the turns: tracing the feather-impression, folding the page into a seed, signing the ledger. Cost is legible in the sealed door and the implied end of avoidance. Internal pressure escalates coherently without requiring external antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (self‑forgiveness) tightens through the tapestry’s resisting/yielding confession and the necessity to engage the labyrinth rather than flee. The key deepening is his decision to re‑weave rather than tear away or abandon, narrowing his path to acceptance. Visible prices accrue: surrendering certainty, accepting the student’s “impossible” move etched in metal, being bested by the girl. Tension is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (expose/undo the false absolution) is clear; pressure coheres and tightens as the ritual begins and the light builds. The meaningful turn comes when her refracted lines interrupt the chant and destabilize the spire, with a visible price (blood, risk, communal rupture). Agency drives the peak; no luck or off‑stage fix intrudes. Stakes stay focused and escalate cleanly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (save/reprice what’s breaking vs. surrender) is clear early and escalates with the breath‑clock and structural failure. The meaningful tightening arrives as the invitation and step forward—an earned renunciation with visible loss. Internal desire and external peril interweave; no cheap coincidence resolves it. Slightly abstracted world stakes keep a hair of distance from maximal visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: honoring the promise to reconfigure grief. Escalation deepens via the cave reveal, the consequential burning of paintings, and the ultimate leap—each step narrows options and raises cost. The accumulative cadence shift before the jump is clear and effective. A sharper on-page resistance moment could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (can whispers beckon them back?) is signaled early and tested: boats turn, then the harder test of convincing Harkin culminates in the hand‑off. Escalation is a textural deepening rather than reversals, but the pressure coheres and tightens once. The visible price—voice/effort and surrendering proof—charges the end. A slightly clearer moment of risk before Harkin’s arrival could heighten stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can she make a way back for the lost and herself) is signaled early and tightens at the mid‑story phone exchanges. Escalation remains mostly tonal and procedural, with one clear agency beat: calling the woman and instructing “Start walking.” The price is an ongoing acceptance of grief in lieu of rescue; the narrative forecloses the fantasy of literal salvation. Still, conflict stays muted, prioritized as endurance over confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (protect vs. reveal) tightens with the impending arrival of the warlord’s men and the immediate truth‑constraint. A clear deepening occurs when Lior weaponizes truffle musk as occlusion and then escalates to burial, foreclosing future options. On‑page jeopardy with the men resolves quickly, slightly muting peak tension, but the internal price and chosen renunciation carry the outcome. The pressure remains coherent and character‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (returning the borrowed memory) tightens as observation becomes ritual and culminates in the beam’s linger. The key deepening is the realization that the boutonnière is a plea, not a gift, which reweights his options. Cost and pressure are primarily conceptual/emotional rather than kinetic, but they scale to the form. The escalation is subtle yet clear under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes compress under one tightening: the rising creek and the door’s demand force a trade‑off at the fork. Agency is clear: he puts his hand to the door, then selects the sob over the maps, foreclosing a life with a felt price. The pressure escalates coherently without needing reversals. A hair more on what he loses would heighten severity, but the cost still lands.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—answer the call versus keep the throne—is legible early and tightens at the fissure. The memory‑bargain deepening narrows options and raises cost; “she could run” crystallizes the choice. Agency drives the climax and the price is unmistakable (physical transformation, abdication). Tension scales cleanly without filler beats.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (capture presence vs become its weight) is signaled early and deepened by the shell’s revaluation. Escalation tracks through recognition (key), relational pressure (“It’s what you return”), and the decisive act (hand‑off and jump), tightening options toward vulnerability. Cost is primarily identity‑level; no antagonist or hard external constraint, but agency drives the turn. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—identity/control over one’s narrative—tightens when Younger Elias appears and reaches for the scroll. The pivotal choice (permit burning) forecloses a long‑held path with audible cost (the scream) and empties the grave, deepening consequence. Pressure escalates coherently from contemplation to act without contrivance. Internal and external conflict braid effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: can Elias meaningfully interpret the heirloom and, by doing so, decide what his practice is now. The tightening occurs when he gives the screw back with an interpretive frame (“tighten… trust the body”), choosing witnessing over fixing. Stakes are intimate and felt; escalation is modest but sufficient for length and lens. A clearer on-page risk (social or ethical) could have sharpened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (use the calm between storms to unbind and reforge the self) tightens as the rune ignites, fractures in fulfillment, and demands a price (the quill’s tip). The key turn is the deliberate shedding and the decision to press the crystallized tip to the oldest scar. Stakes are internal but not abstract—injury history and teacher’s warning make risk concrete. Slight softness remains in external jeopardy, but internal pressure escalates credibly to a peak.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconnection before the cut—is signaled early and tightens when the current demands participation and exacts pain. The decision to “step in,” to endure the hurt, and to stay for dawn while accepting the trees’ loss constitutes an earned trade‑off. Cost is felt (trees felled; magic spent), and tactics shift to planting. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but it coheres and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through the textural turns: mutable definitions → the blank “witness” → the tear → threshold. Cost manifests as the end of the last library and surrender of the witness identity. The pressure coheres (the arbitration test and dying library) and the resolution arises from the protagonist’s agency. A slightly sharper on-page pinch before the decisive tear could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—intervene or preserve the seam—tightens through the counting beats and sensory escalations. The renunciation carries real cost (abandoning the crew; accepting imperfect closure). Pressure is coherent and grows without coincidence solving the problem. A slightly sharper articulation of personal jeopardy beyond “unravel him” could elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can she reframe from fixing to permeating/letting go—tightens as she shifts from mapping to joining the network. The reversal is subtle but clear: she stops trying to extract legible data and risks an offering, then relinquishes the scanner. The price is interior but felt, with a forfeiture of control. External antagonism is minimal, keeping the escalation quiet but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (whether to trust contradiction and leap) tightens from blue path selection to the bolder refusal to choose. The escalation is internal but clear, tested by a tangible trigger (new scrawl: “You don’t widen perspectives by standing still”). The price is entering uncertainty and rejecting her father’s framework during a fraught time. Stakes remain contained yet credible for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (can he hold connection without breaking his practiced distance) is legible early and tightens when the caller proves “different” and begins to cry. The meaningful turn is his restraint—foregoing confession for ritual—culminating in “Try again tomorrow” and hanging up first. The price is the continued solitude and disciplined pattern he chooses over catharsis. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than sharply narrowing options, but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent—whether memory can bind a new covenant—and escalate via density and ritual beats (ink to whisper to bell to departure). The tightening is subtle but legible: she commits to carrying the cost and not looking back. Pressure could sharpen with one on‑page counterforce testing her resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on finding the “cure” and deciding what to do with its mythic vector; escalation is thoughtful, not high-octane. The reveal that Carter’s “cure” is a ledger of names reweights options and forces a trade—keep leverage or pass it on. The price is conceptual yet legible in her surrender of the rock. Pressure stays coherent, if gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reach the stillpoint before the sky unfreezes—stays coherent, with one decisive tightening when the music stops and silence becomes the threshold. Escalation is quiet but real: ring heat, trail notes, then the stop that compels a stance shift. Costs are inward (acceptance over pursuit) rather than externally punishing, keeping the pressure subtle. Still, resolution is earned and not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: whether he can proceed after failure by reframing cause and effect. Escalation is a textural deepening rather than antagonistic—culminating in the universe’s “sigh” and the line on the vellum, which narrows his stance options. The turn forecloses the old fix‑by‑erasure path and commits him to replanting with uncertainty. Price is modest but present; tension is steady rather than jagged.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the forgotten from hunger—is legible early and tightens when the shadow appears. Escalation is coherent: Liora advances into danger; Elias accelerates, weaving a net; the harbor amplifies their tactic. The price is felt rather than enumerated, and the solution emerges from established methods. A minor limitation is the implied cost over explicit sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preserve vs. erase the promise) tightens through discovery to a committed act with visible loss. The revelation “The promise was the fire” deepens pressure before the match is lit. Internal and external conflicts interlock without needing an antagonist. Slightly low on mid‑scene complication; the path is strong but smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency from imposed memories—is clear from the outset. Escalation arrives as her drumming intensifies and the garden trembles, shifting from containment to release; the pattern break is decisive. The cost reads in physical/psychic strain and the foreclosed path with the doctors, though it remains off-stage. One strong tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around the challenge to navigate silently amid shifting routes; the live constraint is the storm’s constant reconfiguration. The tightening turn arrives with the coin aligned to a dent and the decision to step through the non‑door. Stakes read as existential (leave/earn the unchanging map) but the on‑page cost remains muted, keeping tension below peak. Still, agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are intimate and focused: can the boy’s shame be eased enough to change the father‑son stasis. Escalation is a density increase—the weaving accelerates, stars enter the water, and the boy engages—leading to the decisive act of letting the mirror go. The cost is subtle but present (relinquishing her tool, spending herself on others). Pressure remains coherent, though never harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (save the library) tightens via the noon hammer threat; tactics escalate from symbolic displays to material interdiction. The “song” of filings stopping the crew is a clear on‑page stress point, and the town‑wide mirrorboards reweight pressure. Some prices are soft on the page (social consequence, legal risk), limiting peak severity. Resolution traces to Elias’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—answering the call versus remaining land-bound—tightens when the scrimshaw vibrates and the body “unfolds,” foreclosing the human option. The return of the carving is the key decision that triggers the island’s release, paid for by relinquishing land identity. Pressure escalates coherently from sound to transformation to world‑scale consequence. Minor limitation: external resistance is mostly social (dockworkers’ silence), keeping conflict primarily internal.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming authentic expression vs. learned stillness—is announced early and tightens through Harkin’s arrival and the scream decision. The scream is a credible escalation, with cost in breaking the communal hush and self‑exposure. Subsequent choices (burning the tin, teaching whittling) lock in the stance. Quiet, but the pressure coheres and deepens rather than loops.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (what happens when boundaries dissolve) are signaled early and deepen as she syncs with the columns and realizes the ban contained the atrium. The key tightening is the shift from seeking certainty to abandoning it, with the lake’s fracture and answer as the external echo. The price remains implied (social and self-identity), not forced by a narrowing choice on the page. Escalation is strong for a lyric mode but never quite tests her resolve against real risk.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes cohere around breaking silence/forging connection post-phoenix; pressure deepens via the old woman’s barter and Liora’s request to learn. Escalation is primarily tonal and accumulative rather than narrowing options; no hard reversal occurs. The price—debt to the old woman, patience, choosing the cracked over the flawless—reads, but never bites hard. The cadence shift suffices at this length, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can sound re‑weave connection?) is clear and tightens via density: hum → voice‑like presence → path → bell. Escalation is primarily deepening rather than narrowing options, apt for the chosen lens but with limited explicit price. Liora’s agency drives each turn (questioning, adjusting, following, leaving). The cost lives in renunciation, not confrontation, which is effective though soft.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (whether grief isolates or becomes shared light) are focused and tighten through concrete choices: self‑tattooing, shifting craft, and releasing cranes. The decisive deepening occurs when she moves from memorial jewelry to luminous cranes and then publicly leaves them, foreclosing private hoarding. A returned black feather adds pressure via response from the world. Costs are emotional and bodily, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (understanding how belief spreads to prevent another crash) are clear, with a meaningful tightening when the visitor confides her brother’s role and Elias reframes the task (“measure the space between promise and hearing”). Conflict remains primarily conceptual, so costs feel more implied than embodied. The handoff of the tape is a stance choice that forecloses “comforter” and commits to method. Tension rises through density rather than hard reversals, fitting the lens but limiting visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—engage the archive without repeating the fatal pattern—tightens through the decision to turn counterclockwise and let disorder “spill.” Pressure escalates from hum to scream to dissolution with an internal trade-off (knowing vs. letting go). The price is felt in the relinquishment of the object and the veil’s fading. Stakes trend internal but remain coherent and legible under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving and safely containing an unbound hope—tightens from eerie discovery to a costly exchange. The decisive act is Liora’s: offering her shadow, which forecloses a path and faces possession risk. Pressure escalates coherently through evidence (videos) and the curator’s lie, though an extra beat of urgency could sharpen the squeeze. The price (permanent partial loss) reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (redemption through honest care) is signaled early; escalation occurs through the layered commitments culminating in letters and forward motion. Prices are present but subtle—no confrontation, but reputational risk and relinquished resources. Under the accumulative lens, pressure tightens once meaningfully at the market/apothecary beat. The absence of a direct antagonist keeps the profile quiet but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—pursue answers or accept the cost of carrying—tightens with the archive opening, the mother’s file, and the hourglass thawing/running out. The meaningful turn arrives with “She was the thing in the walls” and the confrontation with her mother’s “unremarkable” scar. Final agency is renunciatory but decisive, with visible cost: surrendering her identity as a closure-seeker. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without needing an antagonistic figure.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is early and coherent: retrieve or reframe the “unused love.” Pressure deepens through a pattern break (letters are absence between frames; the “place” is a when), and the storm’s crest coincides with the internal tilt. The earned renunciation (turning off the projector) carries a clear price: ending the chase and accepting goodbye. Escalation is subtle but decisive under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible: find the path and unlock trapped creativity before the light fades. Pressure tightens through the well sequence and the star‑key “song,” culminating in the release surge and dissolution. Agency drives escalation, but opposition is largely environmental and compliant, and the price paid is subtle. The “before the light fades” clock is suggested rather than sharply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—carry and protect a nascent future against timeline resets—is legible and escalates when Hollow chooses to place the spark and wind the clock. The train’s loop and clock’s chime deepen pressure without fragmenting causality. Cost is more conceptual than visceral but present (accepting risk and duty, world already “reset too many times”). A clear tightening occurs at the crate/spark/clock sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are internal—comprehend or dissolve into the hum—and pressure deepens via a pattern break: reaching for the compass fails, forcing a different stance. The narrowing is credible: analysis (unraveling) proves insufficient, prompting renunciation and the loss of wandering as a tactic. The cost is modest but clear in the relinquishment. The escalation is textural rather than adversarial yet coherent and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: cross again or remain. Escalation is a measured tightening—imprint of the star, raised punch, and the refusal to retrieve it—appropriate to the chosen lens. The cost is felt and alters options going forward. The wind nudge slightly externalizes the peak but her non‑action is an intentional, costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restore sound vs. preserve “safety”—is clear early and tightens through the forbidden door and the pianist’s return. The key turn is Elias placing the bolt in the pianist’s palm, foreclosing the silence policy with visible consequences. Pressure coheres; the fortress’s vibrational threat and social risk (guests, master’s seal) escalate without gimmickry. The cost is unmistakable in the shattering cup, strangled scream, and the risk to Elias’s role.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (end the lie/pretender) is clear and tightens meaningfully when the act demands Lirien’s name. The sunder is a true narrowing with visible cost; the subsequent encounter with the relieved pretender deepens consequence rather than deflating it. Pressure is coherent though mostly internal; one more on‑page hesitation could have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—discover and follow the disappearing path—tightens as evidence coheres into a live route under rising water pressure. The significant deepening arrives with the sonar’s line and exposed “road,” forcing a trade‑off: protocol/report vs pursuit. Visible prices (risking safety, professional breach, dissolving map) charge the choice. Escalation is cleanly paced for the length, without soft resets or coincidence‑rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—ending the lull by reignition—is signaled early and escalates via the hum intensifying and communal uptake. Lena’s agency drives key turns (press, aim, hand off, declare “It’s not over”). Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens, but a visible price or foreclosed path is soft; the win arrives without a tested trade‑off. The scout’s arrival confirms escalation rather than challenging it.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—evolve tradition vs. Council orthodoxy—is clear and tightens when Liora must choose to unseal now (“before the embers cool”). The decisive act is hers, but opposition collapses quickly; after the elder’s rebuke, the vine’s “singing” diffuses resistance with little price. The deepening is earned but could use one concrete cost or foreclosed path to sharpen the aftermath. Tension runs sentence-to-scene but peaks gently.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to stay frozen in grief or risk rootedness—tightens through the tourists’ presence and the child’s misreading of the photo. The meaningful turn is Lena releasing the photo and substituting a living leaf, accepting pain via somatic method. The price is clear: she yields an anchor of loss to make room for a different anchor. Quiet, but the pressure coheres and grows under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (embrace necessary dark) is pressured by the physical closing-in and the failed keeper/portrait premise. The decisive tightening is Elara choosing redesign-as-surrender, turning collapse into doorway and stepping into the dark. Cost is legible: self-offering over self-expression. Stakes remain intimate but consequential throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure tightens through the confrontation and the thief’s vanishing, forcing a redefinition of the stake from capture to comprehension. The decisive follow‑through (spill and step) forecloses the simpler path of killing and embraces known risk. The escalation is coherent under a causal lens, though the cost remains more implied than felt as injury or irreversible loss on the page. Still, the reversal (“monster was hunting too”) credibly reweights the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs survival—is signaled early and tightens once Elara commits to flooding the system. Alarms and the Overseers’ arrival escalate external pressure in step with internal cost. The final reversal (her being shot) proves price paid without undercutting her agency. The moral calculus is credible: a necessary sacrifice to break institutional silence.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—guard the sanctuary versus flee—remains coherent with one meaningful tightening when the fissure appears and the wind rises. Agency shows through endurance and care tactics, with a visible price in staying. The plan to patch the dome reweights risk and commitment. Escalation is gentle but sufficient under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—refusing the counterfeit voice to restore pattern—is clear and tightens decisively when the pebbles spell his daughter’s name and the mouth opens. He escalates by commanding silence, then paying the price to purge the shard and accept loss. The stars snapping back evidences consequence tied to his choice. A single contained deepening rather than multiple turns fits length; the only limit is a slight cushion around the final aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—publish vs. protect legacy—is present early and tightens at the ledger reveal. Lydia’s agency initiates the inquiry, but the plates’ arrival supplies resolution pressure from outside, softening the felt price. The final choice is clear, yet consequences and loss are more inferred than dramatized. A touch more on‑page cost would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    One dominant stake (hushing guilt) tightens through a meaningful turn: the machine’s false release and subsequent demand. The pressure coheres into a decisive choice under cost—she stays with the crying baby; the option of erasure is foreclosed. The clock reversal and “tether” deepen rather than distract. Consequence persists: the cry continues even as grace enters the soundscape.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—resist erasure and retrieve/embody meaning—tightens with the flake’s “Interject now” ultimatum and his plunge into the mandala. Pressure escalates organically via density and chorus rather than adversarial reversal, appropriate for the chosen lens. The public mural choice adds social risk, though consequences stay implied rather than confronted. Clear agency drives the turns.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—will the act of remembrance survive power’s threat—are legible early and tighten with the commander’s entrance and drawn sword. Elias’s choice to continue naming under imminent violence earns the reversal. The cost is primarily moral/emotional rather than materially paid on the page, which slightly blunts the peak pressure. Still, the turn is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (interrupt a suicide) is clear and tightens via the path’s appearance, the coin’s echoes, and the future-visions. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the turn is Elias closing his hand on the coin and standing. The price—forgetting, Lydia’s continued liminality—registers. Slight softness: Elias offers minimal resistance on the page, so escalation is more lyrical than combative.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early (find/understand Mira’s pathways), and the meaningful tightening occurs at the follow-or-paint decision. The choice forecloses an immediate disappearance and forces a trade-off: she uses art to create a return path at the cost of absorbing the key and leaving. Pressure coheres and grows through image density rather than adversary mechanics. Slight softness: the personal danger remains more conceptual than felt pain.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—claiming a voice for the waking world under proscribed conditions—tightens as the cave’s living response escalates (lichen flares, fossil heats, map reconfigures). The turn to speaking and being answered is earned. The price (defiance of authority, danger) is present but not pressure‑tested on the page, moderating escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightens as Elias moves from echo to well to threading. The key turn (the face in the amber; the ledger pattern “snapping into place”) deepens pressure and reframes the prophecy as choice. However, external resistance is light, and the retrieval reads relatively unopposed, keeping the on‑page price modest. The resolution stems from his agency and carries conceptual consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to re‑enter the game to “fix what’s broken”—is clear early and tightens at “Open it.” The reveal (key/coordinates in her own hand) deepens pressure and narrows options, and the final renunciation (leaving the pillbox) forecloses the path of retreat. Cost is felt though primarily internal; no antagonist needed. Tension scales steadily without gimmicks.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: cross safely at the right moment or risk calamity/failed vow. Escalation tracks through the first glimpse, the slowed ticking, the second reveal, then the committed move. The live clock pays off as the gutters fall silent mid‑crossing, implying non‑trivial risk and cost. The conflict is quiet, so the price is more felt than explicit, holding this just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is internal—attend to and honor the oasis’s resistant wholeness—with one meaningful tightening as the glass is embedded and fired. Pressure grows by pattern and cadence rather than opposition; cost is present but soft. A sharper external constraint or loss would heighten the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether she can allow growth/hope—tightens as living things fail (basil), harm intrudes (nick), and aid arrives (Elias, second tooth). The escalation is gentle but coherent for the Accumulative lens, culminating in a stance crystallization. Visible prices (blood; letting someone stay) reweight the ending. A single, decisive tightening rather than multiple turns, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to live with remembered extinction—tightens at the hum peak and bird’s impact, then turns on the mirror‑book translation and Lior’s active stances (shielding, recognizing, releasing, stepping out). The price is a relinquishment of penance and the safety of solitude. Escalation is coherent and culminates in a meaningful choice rather than coincidence. Stakes remain personal but consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: whether to keep or rejoin secrets. Pressure deepens when Liora escalates from offering a client‑linked relic to her own unsent letter, narrowing her option to remain a pure keeper. The price is internal and understated, yet discernible in the relinquishment. No antagonist is needed; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes—reclaiming agency from an intervening cosmic pattern that’s exacerbating campus schisms—are legible early. Escalation occurs via on‑page tests: her first pulse alters human behavior, the signal retaliates, she recalibrates tighter, and the pattern shifts. The tightening is real though the price feels low; still, the narrowing of options (she must engage, not report or retreat) reads. The final stance is earned by her choices rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coherently tightens: the descent, the organ’s scream, the spatial rearrangement, and the compass turning to threaten him. The choice to transfix the table with the key forecloses hesitation and resolves the external stakes while testing his internal fear. The price is more felt than quantified, but it is present and influences tactics. Stakes stay focused and escalate without coincidence rescuing him.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness vs. futile prosecution—is signaled early and tightens when the echo manifests and the mayor’s son’s culpability is revealed. Elias’s agency drives the turn (invoking the name, operating the lance, refusing to grasp the echo), and the price is accepting impotence in legal terms. The escalation is a clear density increase consistent with the accumulative lens, cresting at the embodied vision of the struggle. Stakes remain intimate rather than combative, but the felt cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is tight: test the threshold to reclaim/understand Orin, with personal and physical risk. Escalation is coherent: pressure drops, warnings, then a decisive agency beat (pressing the nail) leading to rupture and an immediate, costly reversal. The final renunciation meaningfully forecloses a path. Stakes are intimate but tangible; no empty hyperbole.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (accept the amnesty/step sideways) tightens through density and cadence: glass reveals paths, a brighter thread claims him, music becomes the tactic that narrows options. The price—leaving the known stance/identity and losing the object—is legible, if understated. Escalation is internal but decisive; the melody bends metal and opens the door. A touch more resistance would heighten cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: whether to keep circling (momentum) or accept a reconfigured stillness. Pressure deepens via the lion’s cage and the father’s “spirals” maxim, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses a path. The price is conceptual/emotional rather than external, but it’s legible in the final refusal to seek “what comes next.” The escalation is quiet yet decisive under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding the inscriptions/meaning of burden—tightens when the stars’ rhythm becomes directive and the thread physically engages him. The meaningful turn is the move from decoding to joining, with the cost of surrendering his solitary chronicler identity (ledger gone). Pressure is largely internal but coherent and mounting under the chosen lens. A clearer on‑page test of resistance might have intensified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is set early and escalates coherently through a single decisive deepening when the plant “digests” the confession. The price—abandoning the drowning misbelief, accepting the brother’s choice—narrows his options and informs the renunciation. Tension operates at line and beat scales with no soft reset. Slight limitation: conflict resolves without a hard tactical trade beyond the internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—uneclipsing the covenant—tightens as Liora enters, navigates by pain, and confronts a future self who complicates timing. The bridge sprint is the clear pressure point where she commits despite warning; the result is a knowledge/depth gain rather than a fight. Cost exists (pain, risk, history of being rooted) but feels more mythic than immediate sacrifice at the peak. Still, escalation coheres and ends in a reweighted option set (keeperhood accepted).

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (the cost of unshackling her future) are signaled early and escalate when the roots target “the name of the child she’d failed to save.” The refusal to resist functions as the narrowing choice with a visible price, and the orchard’s rules keep pressure coherent. The reversal is quiet but clear: from trying to mend via objects to surrendering the deepest, specific grief. The cost echoes in the wilted flower and her changed gait as she leaves.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are coherent (meaning vs. price), with one tightening: the “After” inscription reframes the object and forces a stance. The foreman’s “It’s just fabric” adds a light but effective counter‑pressure, sharpening Liam’s choice. Cost is felt rather than dramatic, fitting the lens. Escalation is subtle; no hard reversal, but cadence shifts responsibly.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—learning how to leave without rupture—tightens effectively; the planting and upward flow pivot the pressure. The peak choice is internal but consequential: experiencing the reunion then choosing not to remain. Emotional cost is legible; the scene avoids soft reset. Stakes are mostly existential/intellectual, but they carry felt weight.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: transforming a liminal artifact to preserve/repurpose “almost.” Escalation is modest but coherent: the request tightens options; the lunar flip nudges urgency; the crucible demands a method (two truths). The price is primarily conceptual/ethical (ledger refusal, accepting that people molt identities into objects). Not a high-torque conflict, but it deepens in step with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—use the pearl to dissolve walls versus obey/contain—is legible and tightens through the escalating confessional trail. The decisive act (crowning) exacts a price (bearing collective fear; losing the pearl to the world). Conflict is primarily internal with a light external nudge (command radio), but the pressure coheres under the chosen lens. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness vs self-indictment—is signaled early and tightened by the graffiti’s fork and the day’s walk. The final decision (turn right) forecloses a path with felt cost and aligns with the “sorry” option. External pressure is mild; no strong counterforce beyond conscience, yet the internal calculus carries tension. The “medication clock” and oncoming rain further narrow his window.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused and escalate: record the unsaid before the second letter posts; the chime tightens pressure; the library’s collapse forecloses further options. Agency drives turns—she opens the watch, chooses to tear a single page, and chooses speech over continued extraction. The cost is legible and alters tactics (loss of access, renouncing the watch). Tension is more cumulative than combative, but it narrows options effectively at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserve freedom via contract vs propagate resistance) is signaled early and tightens with the midnight deadline. The choice to shatter forecloses a live path and carries visible price. Internal and external pressures braid (plants’ urge vs empire’s men), and tension scales at sentence and beat levels. No coincidence resolves conflict; protagonist agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and clear: capture a last spark/message before oblivion. Escalation is a decisive intensification when she infuses the chip and the doorway forms, narrowing options to a one‑shot contact with a cost (the chip’s light). Internal and external pressures align, though opposition is atmospheric rather than antagonistic. The price is paid and alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconfiguring grief/contentment—tightens when Maren commits to “the source,” then risks plucking the shoot; the cost is the heirloom and the bodily transformation. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, appropriate to the accumulative lens. The silent confrontation with the arsonist is an ethical turn that forecloses recrimination. Slight absence of external pushback keeps it short of peak intensity but still strong.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to preserve certainty or embrace uncertainty—tightens through the shard’s indictment and the chimes’ “Change” till he renounces his old function (cloak unraveled, polishing refused). The unhooking serves as a concrete pressure test with visible price. Internal and external stakes briefly braid when he retunes the beam’s purpose. Slight softness in external consequence keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres internally: the trance deepens, the pond’s pattern fractures, hovering risks dissolution, then the body snaps back with cost. The dominant stake (how/when to reveal) tightens into a refusal/stance rather than a decision scene with an antagonist. One meaningful cadence shift (pattern break → descent) is present. Stakes stay intimate, which limits visceral intensity but suits the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early (survive/guard the pulse against the Hollow Maw), and escalation coheres: pattern appraisal → anomaly → ritual action that narrows options (he becomes a lure/anchor). The cost is choosing exposure and radical stillness; resolution flows from his agency without coincidence solving the dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—handmade sacred vs automation/institution—tightens through the garden reveal and the dean confrontation. The meaningful turn is Marlin’s refusal: leaving the keystone and exiting with the unruly flame. Pressure is primarily conceptual rather than peril-driven; the treacherous climb is quickly neutralized. Even so, the social/moral cost is legible and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres: ritual habit is disrupted by the snagged lantern and the discovered key; the door and faceless figure force a stance. The decisive tightening is choosing to “make” the color by lighting and releasing his own lantern, foreclosing mere seeking. Costs are conceptual rather than visceral, but they carry into the earned stasis of the ending. One more concrete impediment could have sharpened stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (interpret the prophecy or let existence gutter out) is signaled early and coherently deepens via her agency (choosing the coin, arranging the spiral, consenting to dissolution). Pressure tightens through a single decisive intensification—the harmonic that compels her to risk unmaking. The felt price is clear; off‑stage “others” provide context but not direct on‑page pushback. Stakes never feel abstract despite cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—naming fears at the cost of unleashing them—is legible and tightens meaningfully once the Leviathan becomes “seen.” The warning (“You’ll regret this”) and the ensuing release escalate pressure conceptually more than combatively, culminating in the distant scream. Agency drives the turn; he proceeds despite regret. Slight softness remains: the ritual faces minimal on‑page resistance, muting immediate jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around one stake and tightens at the bell’s first failed hum turning into a weep, then a truer note that shakes the bay. Agency drives each shift; coincidence does not rescue him. The cost is tangible (exhaustion, blood, social skepticism) and the path foreclosed is passivity/abandonment. A sharper risk of backlash (e.g., something breaks or worsens before it improves) could elevate the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether to feed the reservoir or let memory breathe, tightening through the choice to ignite the photographs and surrender the bottle. The visible price (sacrificing the artifacts, shifting identity from warden to son) is unmistakable. External antagonism is soft, but the internal stakes escalate credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (unifying intuition and reason through transformation) tightens through one strong turn: applying flame to the dew crystal, then committing to the door. The blue flame and orchard’s dissolution narrow options; the choice to step through forecloses return. Internal and external pressures align; cost is clear. Slightly meditative pacing but pressure remains coherent and grows.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear and active: ensure the drop doesn’t fall to the wrong hands. Tightening occurs with the jump and the refusal to answer the radio, which forecloses an easier, safer path. Cost is legible but external opposition is minimal, muting visceral risk despite the conceptual stakes. Still, the cadence intensifies appropriately under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is legible early (identity vs erasure), and pressure coheres under a live clock (hearing + history rewrite). The decisive tightening is Kael choosing to merge despite the likely cost, producing pain and irreversible change. Agency drives the turn; no contrived rescue. Stakes remain personal yet ripple outward credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: what kind of “space” Elias holds—game mastery vs. receptive tending—tightens as the seed demands patience. The meaningful turn is the redefinition of the final puzzle and the acceptance of business decline to protect the experiment. Pressure is gentle but coherent; the visible price (lost customers, unsettling stink) fuels the final stance. The escalation is more deepening than conflictual, but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: conjure/restore laughter versus honoring grief. Escalation arrives via the engine’s failure and the tunnel’s “return” of laughter above, forcing a stance shift from conducting to hearing. Because the key turn is externally sparked, the felt price is more thematic than tactical; still, the renunciation narrows his future options. A small hit for agency-light resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keep guarding or release and be unmade—tightens decisively at the figure’s demand for the key. The reversal is Lyssa’s surrender of the pendant, foreclosing her safe stasis. Cost is legible and thematically fused; the escalation is a single clean deepening rather than multiple turns, appropriate to length. A moment more friction at the decision could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake—achieving a forbidden vivification that redefines destiny—is signaled and tightened through a decisive escalation: memory offerings → doubt → taboo incantation. The explosion and reversal of scars deepen rather than resolve pressure, forcing a stance against the guild. The price is social and existential; while the guild’s retreat avoids a direct fight, the path foreclosed is clear. Tension operates across beats without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are coherent: attune to a cosmic frequency that is itself the message; the pressure tightens when the dish shatters, forcing a renunciation of instrumentation. The leap is an earned escalation that risks bodily cost and affirms the surrender method. Still, much tension is lyrical rather than oppositional; resistance is atmospheric more than adversarial. The meaningful tightening is there, just not agonized.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (prevent unraveling, deliver passengers to a stable lane), with a meaningful tightening via the five‑minute collapse. Lira’s choice to “merge the lanes” forecloses simpler options and risks total unraveling; the beat where patterns “snap” provides the escalation’s crest. The cost is felt more as conceptual reweighting than loss, slightly softening impact. Still, pressure coheres and rises under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—activate and risk dissolution to deliver connection—tightens when the eruption begins and the thread spreads and snaps. Agency drives escalation via weaving and release, with a felt trade-off of control/ownership. The dismantlers’ approach adds a faint clock but doesn’t force adaptation. Tension accrues more by density than collision, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure centers on whether to adopt alien methods and how to “unfold” horizons, with Kael’s doubt as the local test. The tightening arrives with the refracted flicker/path, but the scene avoids forcing a hard trade‑off or showing a concrete price. Escalation is more tonal/intellectual than consequential. A single visible loss or risk would sharpen this considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (“Find her before the mist does”) is clear, and tension tightens when the glove triggers the mist’s “scream.” Elias’s agency—tuning, touching, addressing the voice—drives the deepening toward the apparition and the photograph’s repricing. Resolution leans a bit on the supernatural’s benevolence, with cost and foreclosed options implied rather than explicit. Still, the mid‑scene intensification and the final stance shift read earned.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—cross, retrieve/stand-with, escape before seam/tide closes—is coherent and tightens (detector spike; “minutes before the phase seam sealed”). Escalation is primarily environmental and internal; the key turn is the choice to pass through and then depart carrying the charged remnant. The cost is legible but conceptual, keeping pressure high but not punishing. A touch more concrete jeopardy on exit would heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens when silence breaks at 11:47, the ink demands “Defragment,” and she activates the archive, culminating in the sync choice. Stakes remain internal but coherent: the cost of relinquishing the countdown worldview. The escalation is a single, clean deepening consistent with the lens. Slight softness in concrete external consequence keeps it just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—revive a dying language despite danger—is signaled early and tightened decisively when the starlings’ pattern collapses and she chooses to continue. The pressure coheres: success triggers the threat; her agency escalates cost. Consequence is unmistakable: physical entrapment and obliteration into echo. The only minor limit is the absence of a second tactical try beyond the single overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (Elias vs. the garden’s hunger/joke) tightens through the phone’s taunts, the seed’s pulse, and the shadows that pull. The choice to “let the joke rewrite him” is a clear escalation that forecloses return. External and internal conflicts braid well; cost is unmistakable. A touch more on resistance before surrender could have amplified the narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—revival versus mechanization—tightens through one meaningful turn: using the shell to signal, provoking the crack and bloom that force a response. The statues’ attention and the physical shift to earth escalate tension without multiplying threads. Cost is present but soft; consequences emphasize transformation over harm. Still, agency clearly drives the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (deliver the storm under drone surveillance) is signaled early; pressure coheres with the patrol gap and the drones’ closing hum. The key tightening occurs when the storm reveals its function and time runs out, forcing the detour to Seventh. While the drones never directly intercept, the escalation’s cadence shift is clear and the price to continue is felt. A single, earned deepening rather than multiple reversals suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: reclaiming/reshaping voice through silence and craft. Pressure coheres as the melody compels movement, the fragment bridges to the singer, and the ask to “Sing” forces a choice—he offers a nonverbal song, foreclosing speech. Costs are quiet but present (renunciation, perpetual work). The escalation is a deepening rather than a hard reversal, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (reawaken memory into living space) is clear; escalation is a density‑driven intensification culminating in the scarf’s dissolution and the unlocked section. The cost—letting go of the relic and control—is felt and narrows his former tactic of preservation. Pressure remains internal but coheres and tightens under the chosen lens. A single decisive deepening (reading the “spaces”) effectively reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—contain or release a fugitive dream—tightens under a real clock (sun climbing, edges fraying). The failed first attempt escalates; the apparition’s plea forces an ethical trade‑off rather than a mere technical fix. The decisive “Stay” carries visible loss (the dream’s untethered life) and reweights the world’s order. Tension operates at beat and sentence levels without gimmickry.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (open vs not opening), and pressure tightens when the ribbon unravels into a map and the man demands “free her.” The locksmith’s reframing and final renunciation constitute the meaningful turn, with a visible price in surrendered control and client loss. Escalation is more deepening than reversal but remains coherent under the accumulative lens. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early (memories stolen/traded) and tightens through the pedestal beat reweighting options. Elias’s agency drives escalation: choosing to test the stone, then to invoke the oldest word, foreclosing the clean‑slate temptation. Cost is on‑page (tool spent, weight accepted) and the antagonist’s emergence complicates rather than solves. No wasted reversals; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—containing and reframing the door‑shadow while mentoring Kael—tightens when the shadow lunges and Kael’s annotations bind it. The escalation is crisp but somewhat safe; Elspeth’s perfected geometry undercuts danger, and Kael succeeds on his first attempt. Still, the decision to teach “return” over “leave” narrows the path and seeds future cost. The final quiet cadence is charged, not slack.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preserving and transporting wonder) is clear and coheres. Escalation arises from agency: stepping into the other layer, handing over the seed (foreclosing his use), and painting essence on the girl with the implied theft-cost. Pressure is gentle rather than adversarial, but the debt and departure supply a visible price. A tighter on-page resistance would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    One dominant stake—contain the dead or release them—is signaled early and tightens at the “last knot” beat. The refusal to “fix” forecloses a path and exacts an immediate, visible price (sanctuary breaking; social order altered). Tension accrues sentence by sentence toward that hinge without false spikes. The escalation is clean and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: will she force a crossing or accept a costlier patience? The meaningful tightening arrives with the seasonal insight and the third reel, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses immediate passage. Pressure is internal and conceptual rather than oppositional; the cost is accepting uncertainty and foregoing proof. Slightly soft on overt consequence but strong for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—pursuit of understanding versus the cost of illumination—is signaled early and tightened by the globe’s anomaly and Amelia’s line. The crucial escalation is internal but legible: the inversion of snow and pulse of light press Liora toward a renunciation that forecloses disclosure. Cost is clear (career ethics, truth withheld) and the “not answering” stance reframes her mission. Tension is steady and deepens rather than reverses; one decisive narrowing suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—whether to host or expel the code‑ghost—tightens coherently to a single, high‑leverage choice. The ghost’s “into him” revelation is a meaningful deepening that forces trade‑off. The visible price is quiet but real; tension threads at sentence and beat scale. A touch more consequence on the back end would raise the pressure band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reframing the spire/joy) is signaled early and escalates through floors, cipher, and “Look up.” The meaningful tightening occurs when plaintext instructs an external action that seals the internal shift. The cost is conceptual/emotional rather than physical peril but is legible and accepted. Pressure stays coherent without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain separate or surrender into the sky’s memory—tightens once: gust and thread‑of‑light escalate into the choice to fall “into.” The emotional price is felt (renunciation of separateness, acceptance that the ledgers don’t need readers). Pressure is coherent but mostly internal and gentle, which softens the sense of risk. Still, the narrowing of options is clear and culminates in a credible stance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (can she contain the infinite) is clear and tightens under the demolition clock. The meaningful turn is choosing to build the refracting ceiling and then refusing to run as it fails, paying a visible price. The final renunciation (“painted nothing”) is an earned response to escalated pressure and loss. Stakes remain coherent and interwoven with her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (escape the loop) is early and coherent; pressure tightens once when the deck glows in response to Liora’s tracing, prompting a communal, time‑sensitive jump. Escalation is primarily wonder rather than risk; resolution arrives without a felt sacrifice or foreclosed alternative beyond a mild reprimand.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular (repair/time/sister), and pressure deepens via resistance (gummed gear), the mirror‑child’s correction, and the choice to reach in. Escalation is clean if quiet, with the decisive act triggering the door’s opening. The price is implied (years of loss, risk of misreading the key moment) rather than felt viscerally in-scene. Still, agency drives the turn and forecloses “wait and wonder.”

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes consolidate around transforming Veyth into a cradle of respite, with pressure deepening via the bell’s deferred summons and the communal work. The meaningful tightening arrives when Liora rings the warmed bell and then commits to staying. Costs are gentle but legible—giving up the itinerant search for a built, enduring responsibility. A sharper on‑page test or jeopardy could have intensified the squeeze, but the accumulative model still delivers a clear turn.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (delay vs. release) is clear early, and pressure coheres around the puppet head’s emergence and the recognition that it is a key. The deepening is the lullaby’s personal echo which forces a trade‑off; the act forecloses Elias’s lifelong tactic of stutter‑delays. The price is legible and tied to the closing cadence. Escalation is quiet but decisive in this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure rises through the dusk window and the dwindling resource, culminating in the “last nut” choice. The conflict is predominantly internal and environmental; no antagonist enters the scene. The tightening is real but modest, with limited on‑page jeopardy. Still, the renunciation/endurance resolution feels earned and consequential for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to live with separation—tightens from analysis to relinquishment, with the chrysalis placement as the narrowing choice. The insight from observation functions as escalation under the textural lens; the girl’s question tests and seals his stance. The cost (relinquishing the bridge‑builder’s fix/atonement impulse) is legible and felt. Pressure remains internal but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure is subtle but coherent: the patron’s need tests Liora’s craft and stance; the seam appearing marks the meaningful tightening. The trade and the later refusal to open the bottle present visible choices with a conceptual cost. Stakes remain internal and aesthetic rather than survival‑based, but they escalate appropriately for the lens. A clear deepening occurs at the fracture’s revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—can he purge the soldier’s regret without being re-infected—stays coherent, and the ritual act (“pouring” so the pavilion subsumes) provides the single tightening beat. Escalation is modest: the contagious touch and momentary face in the ripples add pressure but never truly imperil the plan. The felt price is more atmospheric than acute, which suits the lens but limits bite. The ending renunciation (he’ll keep tending) is earned but not sharpened by a hard trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal rhythm/communication—is established early and tightened when Liora returns the weight and proposes a concrete method. Pressure escalates from accusation to plan to public test, but friction is relatively low; Elias’s turn is quick, limiting felt price. Still, the shift from silence to noise to a tentative “conversation” reads as a meaningful narrowing of options toward action. The earned cadence shift at the end is persuasive if not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (will she risk self and sanity to embrace entangled memory) tightens through the stranger reflection and the decision to “unfold.” Escalation is a density increase consistent with the chosen lens, culminating in an irrevocable stance. The price remains more implied than dramatized, keeping it short of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (access the combinations to reach the brother) is under a live clock and tightens when the chamber appears then slams shut. The decisive loss (blank manuscript, collapse) raises cost and narrows options; her adaptive tactic (harvesting one seed; later burning the smudge) emerges under pressure. The escalation is clean and coherent for the length, with a felt price. The final plan reframes her stance rather than solving the conflict outright.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—coaxing a true song from grief—tightens as the sculpture’s voice shifts from groans to a melody the grove shares. The pressure intensifies via sensory consequences (insulator heats, glaze “weeps,” fingers numb), and the bird’s reply forces a stance: he plays “for the bird,” then relinquishes the tool. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but coherent under the chosen lens. The price is renunciation and bodily strain, small yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (whether to engage when stakes are invisible) tightens as the nexus pulses and the girl presses him into play. The decisive turn is choosing to move and then handing over the worry stone, foreclosing the path of guarded non‑engagement. Costs are emotional and symbolic rather than physical, but they meaningfully alter the protagonist’s stance. Escalation reads as a density increase consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes cohere around whether listening suffices when conflict erupts; pressure tightens as fireworks escalate and the device “reacts to his silence.” The meaningful turn is the shift from decoding to choosing to intervene, foreclosing his prior avoidance pattern. Costs are felt but largely internal; absence of a direct antagonist keeps escalation modest yet sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (pursue forbidden wisdom/serenity vs. communal norms) is signaled and tightened by the Elders’ arrival and the flower’s invasive visions. Liora’s agency drives the decisive deepening and reconfiguration, and the communal risk is real if softened. The escalation reads as a single, meaningful intensification consistent with the chosen lens. The price is palpable but not scarring, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (locate the source of resilience) is established and tightened by the hour‑long inversion and the dangerous “mouth.” The key turn—retrieving the pulsing seed—alters options and knowledge. However, resistance is light and costs are mostly conceptual, with few foreclosed options beyond the time window. The ending decision to plant at the core is earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear: survive and decode an anomalous wind system. Pressure escalates coherently—from pulsing readings to needle shatter to vortex—and Veyra’s agency (flare) creates the vital tightening. Prices paid (equipment destroyed, patch lost, physical toll) are legible and alter tactics. The resolution is a stance crystallization rather than a neat fix, and it feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (tame vs. free wonder) is clear and tightened via the escalating chime sequence; the crumbling amber sheet forecloses a path. Pressure is coherent and grows in cadence rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. Costs are present but primarily implied (social exile, loss of the forbidden tool), not deeply dramatized. The escalation still credibly culminates in a reweighted world.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—seal vs. see/follow—tightens as the child’s laughter returns and he chooses to widen the breach. The escalation is an internal deepening under pressure rather than a reversal, but the narrowing of options is clear and paid for by renunciation. A hair more concrete hazard could heighten cost, yet the hush-as-pressure keeps tension credible. The ending choice is protagonist-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early (decode feeling as equation) and tightens when the press prints his face and the halo floods him with others’ emotions. The escalation is driven by Elias’s agency—he keeps printing, then chooses surrender over control. Cost is explicit in relinquishing borrowed identities and authorship. The conflict remains mostly internal but maintains tension across beats without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translating longing into action and reconfiguring mentorship—tightens when the woman weaponizes germination and the pendant’s removal triggers the light’s unraveling. The courier’s agency resolves the pressure (rips pendant, steps onto bridge, plants seed, chooses to return), with a visible price (relinquishes talisman and prior identity). Escalation is a clean deepening rather than multiple reversals, fitting the lens. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential (villagers, ridgeway’s survival).

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (proof vs. release) tightens as the frost “answers,” escalating from observation to confrontation. The face in frost and the prism’s heat constitute a credible deepening that narrows options. The decisive act (shattering) carries visible cost and resolves the internal and external tensions. Pressure remains coherent and grows without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is tight: carry a message at the cost of self. Escalation arrives via the amber’s discovery and the commitment to weave the silence, culminating in irreversible release of the tapestry. The explicit price (“sender must stay”) forecloses options and reverberates into the decades‑later beat. Tension is more tonal than contested, but the pressure coheres and deepens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (stabilize/awaken the planet) is clear and escalates coherently through the descent and the act of bartering the silk. The pressure tightens at the fissure with the arches shuddering and the visible cost of surrendering the silk. The resolution derives from his agency and stance (listening, patience). It’s a clean single-turn structure; not many reversals, but the cadence shift is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (uncovering withheld truth) is clear, with escalation through the shard recognition, the intercom warning, the seam’s snap-shut reversal, and the “stop looking” instruction that forces a tactic change. The redirect is a concrete tightening that forecloses one approach. Final agency is a reframed act of attention leading to the step through. The price is mostly conceptual; a slightly more concrete loss would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—remain isolated or accept the tower’s communal “haunting”—tightens through the letters escalating from cryptic to imperative (“Stay”). The key tightening is Elias opting to keep the glass and write back, culminating in abandoning the skiff; this forecloses a life‑line with a concrete cost. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens, with the stone spiral’s growth as escalation. Slightly soft on external jeopardy, but internal stakes carry convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (holding the boundary until dawn) is legible and escalates via the wick’s depletion, the beam’s knife‑like focus, and the shadow’s arrival. The key tightening is the deliberate letting of the flame dip—an endurance choice that forecloses immediate overuse. Costs are more conceptual than visceral; we don’t witness a loss beyond fatigue and reputation, keeping pressure strong but not searing. A clearer on‑page sacrifice or near‑failure would elevate the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around the need to understand and reconcile with the heart, tightening at the public painting where stories move “through” him and the wing is consumed. The price is visible (physical depletion, loss of the wing, acceptance of a helper’s role). Escalation is quiet but distinct—experiment → invitation → journey → communal test → renunciation. No soft reset; the new stance forecloses a path (performer/owner of stories).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accrues via density rather than reversals—the screw’s release, thickened air, and the mirror’s unsettling reflection deepen stakes from curiosity to stewardship. The decisive move is renunciatory: he passes sorrow along and returns to maintenance, foreclosing interventionist “fixing.” Costs are felt but soft; no hard narrowing of options beyond his chosen role. The escalation fits the lens but remains deliberately quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (rekindle a dying realm) is signaled early and tightens through embodied costs (blood, voice strain) to the cadence shift where the world sings back. The escalation is accumulative, not reversal‑driven, yet the hunger of the trees and the thin harmony thread meaningfully raise stakes. The villagers’ entry seals the communal cost/solution without coincidence. Prices are legible and persist into the final state.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether Lena will continue hiding or face and reprice her mistake; the invitation tightens, the Voss reflection deepens, and the annotated thesis crystallizes the choice. Stakes are primarily internal but made concrete by the midnight rule and the keeper role. The cost is legible on the page at the final act. While quiet, the escalation is clean and purposeful with no deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure deepens through pattern: private miracle → public sacrament, culminating in communal rupture (guards kneeling, prince weeping). However, friction is minimal—no resisting force tests Liora’s commitment beyond secrecy—so stakes remain more atmospheric than contested. The single tightening suffices for length, but the on‑page cost is soft. A sharper trade‑off or loss would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—extract or answer the vow—tightens as shelves fall and the frequency spikes. The woman’s “Find me where the light bends” reweights his goal, and the door/bridge compress options toward a single, costly act. The price is legible: duty and world lost for the kept vow. A minor additional beat of jeopardy on the bridge could further sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (expose Veyne and resolve her father’s debt) are signaled early and escalate through Lena’s false-offers until the decisive refusal. The meaningful tightening is Veyne talking himself into a corner, foreclosing Lena’s option of physical violence and shifting to communal justice. The price is internal—she relinquishes the knife and the need to hear the “sound” again—subtle but present. Tension is steady, though danger remains more atmospheric than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are internal-existential (measure phenomena versus becoming it), signaled early and tightened when the needle points to her—foreclosing her prior stance. Escalation follows the accumulative lens: sensation intensity rises, agency crystallizes in acceptance, and the “forests voted” frames a situational pressure. The cost is subtle but present (loss of instrument and skeptical remove). Absence of antagonistic friction limits peak tension but doesn’t break the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (unlocking suppressed creation) is clear and tightens when the lock becomes a mnemonic dial and the wall yields. The decisive turn (choosing paint over charcoal) and the renunciation (letting the lock fall, leaving the lantern) carry felt price. Pressure builds coherently under the hybrid lens with one meaningful deepening. Stakes remain personal but consequential; no contrived antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to confront and embody candor—tightens at the pedestal’s question and again when the letters chorus. The decisive move (writing until empty, then refusing to open the new fragment) forecloses the safer path of gilding and passive secrecy. Cost is internal but felt: drained ink, altered breath, the plate erased. The escalation is a single, meaningful intensification rather than multiple turns, apt for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving/releasing wonder—tightens as the sculpture accelerates and the ice’s integrity thins, culminating in the intentional shatter. Pressure is coherent and grows texturally; the price is the relinquishment of a rare fragment. It’s a quiet conflict without antagonism, but the escalation read is unmistakable. A slightly sharper trade-off or threatened failure would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—risking destruction to fulfill preservation—tightens into the decision to ignite the burn. The pressure is coherent (magnetic shift intensifying, systems failing), and the cost is made visible (sacrificing accumulated growth, relinquishing his role). The box beat deepens rather than diffuses the conflict, turning fear into fuel. The departure afterward extends the price beyond the immediate burn.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around whether to open and how to respond, escalating via the clang, the initials, and the letter’s contents. The turn from private curiosity to communal ritual is clear, driven by Mira’s facilitation. The cost—accepting ambiguity rather than solving—is felt but modest; no option is dramatically foreclosed beyond interpretive control. Tension is consistent, if more tender than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep or liberate—tightens decisively at the console’s demand for a danced password. The price (destroying the archive) is not abstract; it’s enacted through flooding. Escalation is driven by her agency, not coincidence, and deepens rather than resets. The final choice forecloses a path with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (retrieve his wife’s remnants) is clear, and pressure coheres toward one decisive intensification in the chamber, where his method is tested and fails with tangible loss. His agency drives escalation (reading grounds, following pull, pressing flowers, gripping the stone). The cost is unmistakable and forecloses an immediate path; the post-failure renunciation/continuation is a credible endurance choice. The promise to try again reframes stakes without soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: soothe the prophecy’s unraveling force. Pressure tightens via the attempt (brook stilled, lattice formed), the sudden rupture (“snap,” shattering surface), and the partial outcome that narrows options to acceptance. The felt price (pain, failure to catch the thread) informs the final choice to keep and carry a softened hush. Escalation is primarily textural but unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early (learn the building’s language); escalation tightens at the blood contract and the interrogation of the house’s grief. Agency drives the turn—Elias signs, then demands an answer of the bricks. The felt price (identity shift, tutor’s disappearance, sharper whispers) charges the ending. Slightly softer is the explicit risk calculus before signing; danger is implicit rather than named.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve self and loved ones’ memories vs. enforced erasure) is signaled early and coherently escalates: digging → garden shudder → lattice sings → patrol confrontation → arrest. The key tightening is Liora’s refusal to stop after cost signals (petals blacken/silver), foreclosing safety. The patrol scene tests commitment; she trades bodily freedom for liberated memory. Pressure remains focused and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: undoing state violence and reorienting power via the script. Tightening arrives with the Emperor’s entry and the thorn’s irreversible crumble, foreclosing escape and forcing collaboration. The price is emotional and political: the forger relinquishes the purity of vengeance; the Emperor yields status and condemns his own seals. Pressure remains coherent and escalates to a meaningful, earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding and ending the echo—tightens as the shell’s third instruction leads to Kaelis and the live test of threads. The plucked thread that distorts her lullaby is a strong escalation; Veyra’s counter-singing and later renunciation are agency-forward choices with consequence. Costs land: Kaelis is stripped of illicit power; Veyra loses her tie to the echoes. The pressure curve is clean if not multi-turned.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around truth versus comfort, tightening when the vision reveals the child and deepening as Lena risks exposing her own grief. The price—accepting a reframed haunting and Lena’s refusal to “let go” cleanly—is visible. The escalation is lyrical rather than combative, but it sharpens and narrows options credibly. Slight softness in overt external stakes keeps it just below top band.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Liora learns to perceive and enact the hidden pattern—tightens via the whistle test and shared melody. The minnows’ response is the decisive deepening that reweights the scene. The price is conceptual (embracing unseen work over display), legible but gentle. Escalation is measured, not sharp, yet coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus quarantine/safety—is signaled early and tightens at the pit. A meaningful deepening occurs when the stillpoint “pushes back” with meaning, forcing a revaluation of his mission; the decisive choice is to turn the key. Cost is unmistakable on the page (his disappearance; the orchard erased) and his agency drives the turn. Tension is layered through the radio voice echoing the letters, sharpening the decision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (who wields the dawn) is clear early and escalates through concrete pressures (the crack, the silhouette, the voice’s ultimatum). The tightening turn—shifting from sealing to smashing—narrows options and commits him. The price (burning bridges with the voices, unleashing a volatile city) reads, if largely conceptual. Tension operates at beat and sentence levels without convenient resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (redemption through connection vs. solipsistic collecting) tightens when the girl asks him to “make the past talk.” He risks relinquishing control by giving her the jar and inviting her to wind the box; the price is accepting imperfection and non‑ownership. Escalation is gentle but coherent under the accumulative lens. No major reversal beyond the visitor, but the single deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible from the outset (prevent catastrophic resonance) and tightens as the ice thins and the sun fades. The hinge choice (turn the key, accept bodily unraveling) is protagonist‑driven and paid for on the page. Pressure coheres through a single, meaningful intensification without reliance on coincidence. The bodily cost sustains tension into the coda.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres through patience: the live clock is the freeze and the moon’s pull, culminating in the viaduct’s lift and Lior’s step. The tightening is a density/cadence shift rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens. Stakes skew conceptual over visceral; while the social/ideological cost is felt, immediate peril remains muted. Still, the renunciation and step foreclose a path convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake—exposing an erasure linked to deaths—tightens as he confirms human agency (“newly laid” wall) and chooses an irreversible act (smashing the lantern). That action escalates pressure by inviting the flood and removing his light, a credible price that reshapes options. The final decision to reach the archives crystallizes commitment under rising risk. Internal unease and external danger braid coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—act to repair rather than seek absolution—is clear early and tightens through the installation of the heart to the mailed letter and the commitment to keep writing. The storm provides tangible pressure and cost; the hymn surfacing catalyzes the shift from reflection to action. Resolution is earned via agency, not coincidence. Escalation is single‑step but clean and proportionate for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—achieving a new mode of flight despite corrosive danger—is clear from the outset. Escalation tightens when she translates doubt into a new blueprint, jumps, skims the acid, then reconfigures the fall into “conducting,” triggering the workshop’s collapse. The price (wreckage, bodily melding) is explicit and reweights options at the end. While moral calculus is light, internal and external pressures interlock effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is lucid: retrieve erased lives at the cost of self. Escalation tightens through “Access denied,” alarms, and the termination flag; the option set narrows to a single costly path (slot the crystal and accept deletion). Agency drives the turns rather than coincidence. Stakes are felt in the body and system response, not just asserted.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether he will act rather than merely perceive—tightens from vision to preparation to stepping onto the ice. The beam-as-metronome and dusk arrival create a live clock that coheres the pressure. The reversal is an internal stance crystallization with external risk; consequences are implied rather than dramatized. Clarity of cost is sufficient but could be sharper with one concrete loss or constraint paid on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (life vs. scheduled death) is signaled early and tightens through the rescue and communal response culminating in the heirloom’s reframing. Escalation is more internal than adversarial; the ice crossing lacks resistance but serves as the necessary pressure test. The visible price is a renunciation of her appointment and an embrace of open‑ended cost. One deepening turn suffices at this length, though a touch more friction in the crossing could amplify stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can he reconcile opposing truths and proceed—tightens via the letter’s fragment and the decision to draw. The escalation is a deepening rather than reversal, fitting the chosen lens; sketching reframes the conflict from recreating her to rediscovering the “space between.” The price—acceptance of permanence in his role and the loss of the imagined reunion—is legible. Slight softness in external pressure keeps the turn from feeling razor‑edged.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve the clearing’s subtle wisdom) tightens as the clearing blurs and the disembodied voice presses, “You can’t hold it forever.” The turn lands when Lysan refuses total victory and chooses “long enough,” foreclosing permanence and accepting ongoing loss. Costs are internal and situational rather than dramatic, but the single intensification is clear and earned. Tension is quiet yet coherent throughout the consecration beat.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (transmuting communal pain) is signaled and coheres; pressure deepens through timed light, the butterfly’s perch, and the decisive shutter. The tightening is modest but clear, with her endurance and attention serving as agency. Costs are primarily emotional and temporal; no antagonist, but situational pressure suffices. The click is an earned culmination, not a coincidence‑driven solve.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding the hush to reclaim meaning—tightens when the crystal inverts the line and silences reveal the pattern, followed by the woman’s proposition. The decisive move is choosing to leave and join the mapping effort, foreclosing solitary obsession. Pressure escalates via density and cadence shift rather than danger; the cost is present but not punishing. Still, the internal/external threads interlock effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (keep seeking echoes vs. let go) is live early, and pressure coheres as sound/images intensify to the sculpture’s activation. The decisive tightening arrives when he engages rather than flees, then chooses cessation of the method that sustained his compulsion. The price—foreclosing his role as finder—lands in tactile acts (snapping arrows, leaving chalk). Stakes remain intimate but unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (let it collapse or reconfigure the moment) tightens appropriately as the foundations shake. The decisive act—matching the hand’s rhythm—reverses the pressure and exacts an internal price (renouncing repair). Escalation is clear for the chosen lens, though external jeopardy remains mostly conceptual rather than visceral. The resulting “release” feels earned, not convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—enacting a flawless goodbye—tightens when she chooses to play the hymn anyway and culminates in relinquishing the shard. The cost is felt (giving up the object that has disciplined her kindness), and the pressure remains coherent. Escalation is gentle and mostly internal, which caps intensity, but the single decisive deepening is clear and earned. No reliance on coincidence or offstage fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (open/close the loop to reach and name the shadows) tightens when the automaton reveals the waiting shadow and second keyhole. Elara’s decision to turn the key forecloses safety and triggers irreversible passage. The cost is legible, though largely conceptual; a slightly more embodied consequence at the moment of crossing could heighten it. Pressure remains coherent and escalates to a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve/repair the brother’s loss—arrives early and tightens with the changeling reveal and memory‑flood. The key turn is Liora’s bargain (“Turn them into stars”), which reweights options. Escalation is elegant but soft: the garden and changeling yield quickly, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed on the page. The resolution feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes clarify early (how to keep light without fire) and tighten with the girl’s request, forcing Liora to choose between solitary guardianship and transmission. The renunciation (giving the sea glass) carries a tangible price and reconfigures roles. Pressure is primarily internal and situational, appropriate for the lens, though the external counterpressure (villagers) stays offstage. The escalation is quiet but decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates quietly but coherently: public backlash → sanctuary → Javier’s arrival → planting → the pendant trade. The cost is legible in the heirloom’s surrender and in their mutual vulnerability. Stakes remain focused on meaning‑making rather than event peril, which fits the lens. A single deepening beat (the gift) narrows options convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (recovering the novel’s life) tightens as images accumulate into a clear price for control. The meaningful turn is his shift from forcing to listening, culminating in surrender—an agency choice that forecloses the old path. The cost (self‑erasure into the story) is felt. Pressure is coherent, though conflict remains largely internal/lyric rather than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (save the arbor/blessing) is explicit, and pressure tightens as the song begins to work and her throat burns. The key turn is her renunciation of tools in favor of truth/song; the final verse (“the moon’s cradle”) provides a credible cadence shift. Costs are present but light; no real setback tests commitment beyond initial hesitation. Tension is more lyric than combative, yet it holds.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—keeping starlight—tightens through ritual precision to the seal. The beat where nothing happens before the plate warms functions as the crucial pressure point. Cost is quiet but legible: blood, time, and renunciation of the world’s larger “ending/beginning” in favor of patient craft. Escalation is primarily cadence and density rather than adversarial force, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recalling wonder/time—tightens via the season ending and the gear alignment culminating in the lullaby. Escalation is driven by his choices (diagramming, aligning, tuning) and timelock pressure. The visible price is subtle; no significant loss or foreclosed alternative is paid on the page. Still, tension operates at beat and sentence levels effectively for this quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: purge burdens without self‑erasure. Tightening arrives when the grotto “wants to give back,” foreclosing the simple purge and forcing a trade (selfhood for release). The lingering child’s fear precedes the larger reversal, layering pressure credibly. Cost is unmistakable though a brief hesitation before surrender could sharpen the crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres as a quiet internal contest: contain vs. release. The meaningful tightening arrives with the girl’s question and the dream, which nudge the final choice to keep the mid-leap lion. Stakes (how to live with loss) are felt, with a visible price in the refusal to sell and the relinquishment of containment. It’s subtle rather than sharp, but the cadence shift is decisive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (can she prevent her past selves from “following” her or be taken) are legible early and tighten when the chorus of Liras surfaces and accuses. The ghost’s challenge escalates pressure, narrowing options toward the jump; the price is surrendering to the very past she sought to manage. Agency drives the turn—raising the wheel, rejecting bargaining, jumping. Cost lands on the page with consequence rather than abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reconfigure the terminal from dead monument to useful passage—is clear and tightens through the resurrection beat and the decision to build a bridge. Escalation is primarily knowledge and system-deepening rather than confrontation; pressure is coherent but low on risk. The trade-off (abandon spaceport fantasy; deviate from assigned task) lands but with limited on-page consequence. A single sharper obstacle or cost would heighten the tightening effect.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a forbidden dream at personal and communal cost—tightens via the crack decision and imperfect assembly. Pressure escalates coherently from contemplation to sacrilege to release. The cost is legible (ruined forecourt, social censure, self‑redefinition). Quiet, but the one decisive intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are internal but legible: continue chasing the father’s map or relinquish it. Pressure tightens through the canal split, the marsh’s hush, and the radio’s “last broadcast,” culminating in the ledger’s sacrifice. The price is tangible and alters tactics immediately (quest foreclosed; she turns back). The escalation is quiet but decisive, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes cohere around whether the past can be preserved and tended in the present; pressure intensifies via the revelation that the rope holds storm-voices and the decision to splice in the seed pod. The escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than a reversal, apt for the lens. The price paid is subtle, more vow than loss, which slightly mutes urgency. Still, the ending’s charged poise clarifies the commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (rendering an absence into direction) is clear; escalation arrives via the thread’s “pull” and the locket discovery. Elias’s agency governs turns (intimate act with the thread; pocketing evidence; resolve to report and to board later). The visible cost is muted—there’s little immediate friction resisting him. Nonetheless, pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens at the membrane pierce and the not‑legendary emergence, culminating in the lurching flight that threatens the palace. Agency drives escalation; the “flawed genesis” reframes success/failure with a visible cost. No antagonist needed; tension is internal vs. world‑built machinery. Slightly soft external consequence (palace doesn’t quite force a trade‑off yet) keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    One clear tightening: the cry interrupts ritual, forcing Liora to enact her ethic under pressure by using the very thread she’s been sewing. The cost is legible (blood on the thread; ongoing social scrutiny) and informs the closing sprint toward the alarm. Stakes remain focused on identity and action coherence. Slightly low friction in the rescue sequence keeps the escalation just shy of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to unstick sealed memories—tightens from investigation to a forceful, consequence‑bearing choice. The resistance of threads and trembling chamber escalate pressure credibly. The price is primarily civic/ontological rather than deeply personal, which slightly mutes the felt trade‑off. Still, the narrowing of options and irreversible release are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—share light without loss—tightens when the gear demands a memory, turning desire into a trade. The escalation is internal but concrete: heresy vs. inheritance, comfort vs. transit-of-self, culminating in the surrendered first-bloom and step. Cost is legible and alters options going forward. The pressure remains coherent without requiring an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (how to hold/shape grief) is signaled early; escalation occurs when the chisel slips and the father intervenes, forcing a tactical shift with visible cost. The move from engraving names to carving hollows forecloses a path and reweights meaning. The final dinner act (placing the butterfly) crystallizes commitment. Stakes are mostly internal but carry real consequence for legacy and practice.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—moral balance versus communal denial—tightens when the pause “feels different,” pushing Elias to risk a further alteration. The on‑page act of pressing the bob with the carved names both escalates and exacts a social price. Quiet but coherent pressure under the accumulative lens, culminating in the reweighted chime. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential for the village.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—unraveling intention—tightens through the knot sequence, each turn narrowing ignorance and raising uncanny pressure. Elias’s agency drives all escalations; the vision reweights the marriage/death truth and alters his next move. The price is chiefly in the risk of confrontation and the moral weight of unveiling, not a concrete loss. Tension is steady, if quiet, rather than knife-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: whether she can shape a viable future without violating it. Tightening occurs at the hesitation, then the wind/ice groan, culminating in the spire’s answer. Agency is her decision to press ink into possibility; the price is felt as risk of rejection and brief destabilization. Stakes remain more conceptual than visceral, limiting escalation’s punch.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (voice vs. repression) is signaled early and tightens with the knock and the broadcast that follows. The meaningful turn is inviting Lira to speak, risking exposure and handing agency to the city. Cost is clear in the aftermath (Elias gone, radio cold), though escalation remains a single deepening rather than multiple tests. Pressure stays coherent; no coincidences resolve anything.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to make meaning last without falsifying it—intensifies via the burn (sacrifice of understanding), the delicate powder operation, and the temporal pressure of the chair stopping. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the textural lens; the tightening is a renunciation with cost. The final choice to leave preserves ambiguity for patrons while foreclosing intimacy with the subject. Stakes remain internal yet legible and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs erasure—is signaled early and tightens through Veyra’s threat to the crews’ arrival. Elias’s agency becomes refusal under cost; the path foreclosed is survival. The escalation is clean, coherent, and culminates in a visible price. Internal and external conflicts braid without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes focus: can presence sustain a decimated choir without erasing fracture. Escalation is a density build (from solitary contemplation to quartet hum), with a clear narrowing to quiet endurance. The price is the renunciation of loudness/repair in favor of fragile continuity. Tension is quiet but coherent and earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to violate taboo and transform the fruit into food for others—tightens through planting, tasting, and public serving. The meaningful turn is the choice to feed the homeless rather than hoard or sell, foreclosing career-safe paths. External antagonism (critics/elders) is summarized not dramatized, keeping stakes felt but soft. Cost reads as social and vocational, not physical.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (reviving wonder vs. safe routine) is signaled early and tightens at the decision to sacrifice the Last Wonder. The beat of commitment (seed into node) is the meaningful narrowing, with a visible price (heirloom gone; likely disbelief from authorities). Escalation could use one additional resistance or risk vector; success arrives quickly once he acts. Still, internal and external conflicts braid effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused (seeking the hush’s truth) and escalate via a density increase: arrangement → voice → flicker → door click → renunciation. The choice to leave the shard forecloses a path (keeping power/ownership) and reweights meaning. Pressure is more internal than external, yet it coheres and tightens once. A sharper felt price on the page could elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (kill/save; ossified certainty vs. living nuance) tightens through one meaningful deepening—revelations that force a renunciation choice. Agency is clear in the intruder’s press and self-endangerment; price is legible. Micro-reversals (belief → doubt → action) escalate cleanly without coincidence resolving the core pressure. Stakes remain embodied rather than abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is coherent: whether to escape or honor the missed moment. Escalation tightens via discovery and an actionable exploit (throwing the chipped die, running sideways), culminating in a moral trade‑off at the door. The price—refusal of an apparent remedy and leaving a talisman behind—is legible. Tension is largely internal yet active on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is internal/communal: can language and kindness survive exile and smog. Escalation arrives via the child’s laughter and the fig’s response, prompting the key choice to write the laughter and accept sleep. Prices are modest but felt (worn brush, vanished leaf, relinquishing vigil). Pressure is quiet and coherent for the mode, if not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around the dominant stake: memory/art slipping away. Escalation deepens through discovery (hands) to proof (oven) to irreversible act (shattering lens), with the visible price of losing a singular artifact to save a living practice. No antagonist, but the tightening is clear and character-driven. Slight softness in immediate resistance keeps it just shy of maximal torque.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (step beyond fate) is clear early; pressure tightens when the mechanism “sings” and the stones peel back, forcing the go/no‑go step. The tide as a literal clock adds cost and narrows options; his choice forecloses return. Escalation is primarily one decisive intensification rather than multiple turns, but it’s enough at this length. Consequences land on the page rather than in declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens through a decisive tactic shift (not at but through). Reversal is earned by the dream‑dictionary rule and the lie. Cost is mostly conceptual (lingering curse, hungry clasp) rather than bodily, keeping it high‑level but felt. Pressure remains coherent to the end without coincidence bailout.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: transform obstacle into instrument. Pressure tightens with the sea’s answering voice and the decision to strike the heart, which reweights the field. Costs are mostly conceptual (risk to self/others, prior damage to a junk) and the ending’s uncertainty functions as earned tension. A more explicit trade-off or loss on the page would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: engage the watchers to learn and act on the expedition’s fate. Escalation is a clear deepening: the crack answers, the watchers move, the shells “translate,” and the twin gate’s opening narrows options toward a single crossing. Agency is active at each turn, and the price is a renunciation of safety and instrument (whistle). Stakes remain intimate but charged rather than spectacular.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent (truth vs. institutional suppression, with legal peril) and escalate through concrete beats. Elias’s choice to present “parallels” rather than flee or fight narrows options and reweights the conflict. The police radio and Callahan’s lunge provide credible tightening. The price is felt but not searing; still, the trade-off is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to commune with what’s abandoned—tightens through the found note and culminates in giving up the inkwell. Escalation is quiet; pressure accrues via time (engineers at dawn) and the memory of the Keeper rather than conflict beats. The price is felt but the opposition remains largely internal and aesthetic. Still, the reply and sealing, then the trade, are clear turns.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten once meaningfully with the sealed chamber and book revelation, deepening options and narrowing paths toward secrecy. Pressure is cohesive (time before power returns, risk of flooding) but remains largely atmospheric, not forcing an explicit loss beyond chosen silence. The choice to leave the chamber intact is agentive and alters future paths. A sharper on‑page price (risked injury, lost resource, or burned bridge) would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—release versus holding on—tightens through the gem’s “bite” and the quickened descent. The reversal comes when the cranes animate and the isle’s “sinking” reframes as “unfolding,” forcing a final surrender. Cost is unmistakable: pain that “rewrites” and self‑surrender into the recording. Escalation remains coherent and driven by her choices rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes (whether to risk collapsing the field to reach the pre-choice thread) tighten credibly via “spiking” readings, the keyed frequency, and alarms. The scientist’s warning sharpens the tradeoff, and Lena’s decision visibly forecloses a safer path. The cost is on-page (system failure, blackout) and thematically integrated. Tension operates at sentence and beat scale without gimmick reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether access and connection will be unlocked, tightening at the theft and again at the seam’s opening. The opposition is gentle—one lunge and protest—so tangible risk remains low even as emotional stakes rise. The cost is primarily renunciatory (not keeping the missing piece, surrendering distance), which reads but doesn’t bite hard. Escalation is clean but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (will he face the withheld truth?) tightens via the accusatory whisper, the watch-hand renunciation, and the time-stamped note. The note “tomorrow” credibly escalates pressure and narrows options. Agency is present at key turns (throwing the hand; deciding to go), though the revelation mechanism leans coincidental. Costs are legible and carried into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear (free the boy) and tightens when “They won’t release the boy” forces a new tactic. Elias escalates via a costly trade that leverages memory and intelligence, not force. The price (sentimental loss; war’s continuation) is legible. Escalation is elegant rather than dramatic, but sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—leave vs. stay/repair—is signaled early and tightens when he chooses to count poles backward to the post office. The renunciation of departure, followed by the tangible acts (opening letters, setting the compass on the bar), makes the price real. Pressure remains coherent and grows via pattern intensification rather than antagonist. A slightly soft external test keeps it shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (whether to renounce the violence‑bound past and risk regrowing empathy) tightens as the lake forces a choice and the throw forecloses the retreat. The meaningful turn is unmistakable: throw → path opens → tunnel collapses → he confronts the man. Price and agency are both legible, though external antagonism is minimal by design. Tension operates at beat and image scale without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—bring him back vs. accept change—is signaled early and tightens through two attempts: a tentative probe and a committed pull that exacts a price. The collapse of the stag into stardust and the “wrong” brother are earned escalations that narrow options. The final stance forecloses the revival path with visible emotional cost. Pressure remains coherent under the chosen lens without deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is focused (recover/repair time with the brother) and intensifies through a single meaningful tightening: the crack turns ledger and demands a price. Agency drives the turn—her choice to trace, to reach, then to release—while the cost (irretrievability, shattered relic) is unmistakable. Pressure coheres without an antagonist, and coincidence does not resolve the conflict. The benediction ending reads earned, not soft.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—tightens through a credible failure (thread snaps) and a final, costed push. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to try again, widens the tear, and acts on the AI’s “Now.” The price (sacrifice of the ship and self‑unraveling risk) is legible and reconfigures options. Tension operates at beat and line levels without relying on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to enact transformation—tightens as the hush becomes pressure, the tide flees, and a fresh prophecy appears. The decisive throw of the vials forecloses a path with visible price. Escalation is driven by her agency under the accumulative lens rather than an external antagonist. The raft departure extends consequence rather than resetting tension.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (open the armory to ignite revolt) is early and clear, with one solid tightening via the timed reset under blackout. On‑page danger (alarms, stored orbs flaring) frames risk, but there’s no reversal; success comes on the first pass. The price is primarily situational, not personal or moral, which tempers intensity. Still, agency drives every step to the click and signal.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (prevent unmaking/hold the promise) tightens from searching to confronting the mirror to anchoring at visible cost. The reversal is strong when the sequences are reframed as anchors, forcing a committed act. Prices (blood, searing eels, bone‑deep dust; lifelong burden) are legible and endure. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—keep/preserve vs. relinquish/transform—tightens via the chimes, the leak, and the self‑test of pressing the poem to glass. The decisive act (tearing the poem) carries a visible price and narrows options. Pressure is coherent and grows without reversals for their own sake. Quiet escalation fits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (win on their own terms vs await judgment) tightens through the duel-turned-puzzle. The meaningful deepening arrives with the reveal that Liora seeded the code, forcing Elias to match her method and choose partnership. Agency drives turns; coincidence does not resolve. The price is largely reputational/strategic rather than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving a fragile resistance vs. Elias’s urge to molt/leave) is clear and tightens when Maren calls him on leaving, compelling a tradeoff. The reversal is internal and credible: touch and shared work quiet the itch, and he chooses the page. Cost remains more implied than enacted (guards offstage, departure deferred), keeping escalation strong but not searing. Tension hums consistently without multiple turns.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (reunion/defying fate before night) tightens through a single meaningful intensification: the film path appears as the compasses lock, and the projector sputters out, forcing now‑or‑never. Escalation is coherent and largely agency‑driven, though resistance is gentle rather than bruising. The “horizon invites night” clock adds subtle pressure. The price is more atmospheric than explicit but registers.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is present early (protect memory vs psychic cost), and pressure tightens with “dreams turned hungry” and the looming monsoon. The decisive act (biting the seed at the ridge’s peak) carries a visible price that reshapes identity and communal outcome. The turn from diagnostic certainty to humbled repricing (“They were the island itself… remembering her”) deepens conflict without gimmick. Slightly more friction in the beat where she shifts from planting to ingestion could heighten escalation, but the throughline holds.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: either remain drowned by regret or learn to let memory move through him. Escalation is a density increase—needle bleeding color, bonsai’s response, then the plant‑and‑tuck decision—culminating in a trade‑off (release over fixation). The cost is subtle yet felt: surrendering the wound’s leverage and owning complicity in an unresolved quarrel. No antagonist or sharp reversal, but the tightening is sufficient at this length.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake: whether Elias can find meaning in destruction by shifting his scientific paradigm from control to witness. The pressure is unconventional but effective, accumulating through patient observation until the moment of "Recognition" provides a decisive deepening of his understanding. The final decision carries the clear cost of abandoning his established research path, making the resolution feel earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—the search for purpose—and expertly escalates it with the discovery of the brother's handwriting, making the conflict personal, external, and dangerous. This tightening provides a strong narrative engine for the second half. The final decision carries a clear, felt cost: the loss of a tangible guide (the ledger) and the painful truth about her brother. The pressure builds coherently under an accumulative lens, forcing a genuine stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    The dominant stake—overcoming an unnatural, absolute silence—is signaled immediately and escalates beautifully. The conflict deepens from a personal struggle to a collaboration with the storm itself, driven entirely by the protagonist's agency. The cost is visceral and specific ("fingers bleeding onto the keys," "heat-map burning"), making the final resolution feel hard-won and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story establishes a clear, potent stake—the restlessness of the dead—and escalates the pressure effectively. The conflict develops not through overt action but through an intensification of atmospheric and psychic disturbance, fitting the Accumulative drive. Elias’s agency in the climax is decisive, and the resolution is earned through his costly physical and existential journey, solidifying the story's central tension with a quiet, powerful finality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story establishes its dominant stake—dignity against dehumanization—early and escalates it with precision. The conflict tightens perfectly from the personal risk revealed by Liora's note to the collective crisis of the arbor burning. Elias’s choice to ring the bell is a moment of pure agency under extreme pressure, crystallizing the stakes and leading to a resolution that is earned, costly, and emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake—resolving the "weight of something half-remembered"—is signaled early and deepens effectively. Pressure escalates texturally, culminating in the critical choice to touch the jade, which forces a painful but transformative confrontation with the past. The cost is legible in the memory of his failure, which is not erased but re-contextualized into a new, lifelong purpose, demonstrating a strong, earned resolution under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story signals its central stake—understanding the hazardous nature of time—and escalates it into a personal crisis of being trapped “in when.” The confrontation with the woman crystallizes the threat, forcing Liora’s climactic act of agency. The cost is legible and the resolution is earned directly through her choice to sacrifice the artifact, foreclosing the path of discovery for the sake of survival.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep forcing growth or learn to witness decay—tightens once when the dust patterns reveal absence rather than revival. The pressure is coherent but diffuse; the visible price (abandoning his research program) is declared rather than dramatized in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single escalating stake: “find what survived the fire vs. accept absence.” Ledger discovery tightens it; releasing the strip crystallizes renunciation with felt price. Stakes remain abstractly rendered, keeping score just below 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into music—tightens when the frozen air refuses the first note. Escalation is Accumulative: each attempt layers density until the storm itself is played. Cost is fingertip blood and mentor’s death; agency drives every shift.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—tightens when patrols torch the arbor, forcing Elias’s public twelve-ring defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“where unused love goes”—is signaled in the second sentence and intensifies until the live reconfiguration; no secondary dilution. Escalation moves from chase → contact → revelation → renunciation as each breath test reduces Elias’s options and redefines agency: he must carry instead of catalogue.

No resolving coincidence; all progression roots in his micro-choices under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—retrocognitive entrapment—signals clearly with the halo’s hum. Pressure escalates as photographs literally peel the past away; escape hinges on sideways traversal along geometry’s fault.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—whether to speak the true storm timing—is signaled early. One decisive tightening: Liora chooses silence, letting the storm come. Cost is visible in the vanishing footprints and dissolved weight in her ribs. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the swallowed truth—tightens when the valve wheel’s weight and the phantom loom force Elias to confront Luz. Escalation is driven by his agency; cost is legible in the wheel’s exhalation and his dawning burden.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—surrender to silence—intensifies via density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals; pressure tightens once when the swan dissolves, but the keeper’s agency is largely observational, so the cost is atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Elias midwife Mira’s voice without breaking therapeutic or personal limits? Pressure tightens once: the eclipse forces a public, irreversible intervention. Agency is Elias’s decision to bring them to the ridge and surrender the vial; the cost is Lila’s trust and his own custodial burden. Coincidence (eclipse timing) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—collect stories before they vanish—tightens when the tapestry’s axis moves and the world tilts. One decisive intensification: Elias lets the displacement hook him, trading balance for story. Cost is visible in the ash of the diaries and the bronze-quiet hum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the flow of open secrets while surviving exposure—tightens when the daughter warns “They’re coming.” One decisive turn: Chen relinquishes the film and the lighthouse. Cost is visible in the extinguished beacon and one-way ticket; agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are singular: will the priest illuminate the anchor’s lie before possession locks? Pressure escalates as each pedal loop tightens the silence and indigo rewrites the cage’s assumptions. The final reconfiguration is earned by his vanishing act, which forecloses his own return and forces the novice’s turn.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: seize silence before exhaustion hits. Pressure tightens as the mirrored horizon unzips and ice-songs begin; Li Wei’s final act crystallizes his stance without external salvation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—becoming whole—escalates through each retrace; the final merging forecloses eternal return with visible loss of the tablet and the loop. Pressure tightens once, decisively, under causal lens. Cost is legible in the settling weight of gravity.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—tightens when the backward songs force a choice: retreat into silence or risk teaching again; the cost is the reopened wound of past rejection, visible in the wrapped needle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve integrity in isolation—is declared early and tightened by each escalation: the “breathing” note, the choice to hide evidence, the recalibration of the storm recorder. Cost is the forfeiture of open action.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep feeding the Luminara with his grief—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is a single deepening: realization that the flowers feed on him, forcing the renunciation. Cost is visible in the smashed lanterns and the ticket bought with the vial’s sale.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“what to do with a thread once pulled”—is signaled early; pressure tightens through the rope’s hum, the beings’ added strand, and the final snap that forecloses escape and forces creation; cost is felt in burned hands and the unknown climb.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—beauty in the unfinished—tightens when Liora chooses to begin “something new” rather than complete her father’s melody. The child’s arrival complicates; Liora’s agency reframes the hush into song. Cost is the relinquishment of closure itself. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth versus counterfeit longing—is signaled in the first 100 words and tightens when Liora rewrites the petal’s charge. Agency resides in her deliberate fusion of insight and empathy, foreclosing the chemist’s escape route. Cost is visible: the chemist leaves empty-handed, weeping. One meaningful deepening—petal’s knowledge of his rewritten memory—escalates stakes under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—tightens when Elias trades profit for covert charity. The cost (ledger imbalance) is named but lightly felt; escalation is single-turn yet coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“how to make belonging real”—is signaled early and tightens when the arbor’s incompleteness forces the search. The deepening is driven by Reed’s agency: organizing the pairs, choosing to go alone, accepting Syl’s co-authorship. Cost is visible in the violet-stained hands and the dawn constellation of prints.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prevent the giant’s awakening—tightens when Elspeth must choose between the moth and the city. One decisive tightening: hurling the jar forecloses retrieval of the boy. Cost is visible (boy unravels, echo leash lost). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mapping grief’s mathematics—tightens when the orchard’s silence refuses the equation. One meaningful deepening: the clear eye clouds, foreclosing the possibility of perfect resolution. Cost is visible in the dissolving lichen tear and the hollow in his chest. Escalation is accumulative: each droplet, prism flare, and mist swirl reweights the stake without external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to remain unseen vs. urge to connect—tightens once the outage cracks his routine. Agency drives escalation: he risks exposure with each cached gift. Cost is legible in the final step into light. No coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep numbly painting horizons or step into the island’s deeper pattern—is signaled early. Escalation tightens once: the vision forces a trade-off between artistic truth and rest. The cost is the return of insomnia and the straight rain that now demands more work. Agency remains his; coincidence (rain trail) only guides, never solves.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will Liora seize or surrender the pearl?—is signaled early and tightens once when the entity confronts her unseen blindness. The cost is conceptual (she forfeits certainty), but the on-page price could be sharper; the renunciation feels inevitable yet painless.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: restoring the city’s voice vs. accepting its silences. Pressure tightens when the restored council’s horn demands a response; Elias’s refusal to proclaim and instead pass the valve narrows options with felt cost. Escalation is one deepening, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—name the unspeakable loss—escalates from deciphering cracks to tearing open reality; the tightening choice is the whispered admission that forecloses reunion. Cost is immediate: tool gone, sister still absent, path redirected. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only reveals, never rescues. One decisive intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—sculpting space for her brother’s echo—is signaled early and tightened once: the transcribing shifts from skeptical ritual to irreversible memory-door. Cost is visible when she releases the tile and parchment, accepting the echo over resurrection. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via whale-song density and tile glow; no coincidence resolves. One beat could be sharper: the “courageously kind” thought is abstract, softening the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Spatial mutiny escalates from passive “light shivers” to active corridor-swallowing void. Stakes crystallize into personal extinction/ transcendence; the choice to drop the fragment anchors the decisive change.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—twelve lives versus one ledger—tightens when Lira realizes the math is rigged against her. The ink’s liquefaction of names is the decisive turn that forecloses the old ledger-world and forces flight. Cost is visible: the blank ledger and permanent ink stains on her skin.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—capture time’s texture—tightens when the unknown hum threatens to erase or expose him. One deepening suffices: the hum becomes Elara, shifting obsession from collection to resurrection, foreclosing anonymity. Cost is conceptual: once heard, the dead demand audience; the silence after lamp-fade is the price. Agency remains his throughout; coincidence merely whispers, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to exist when officially dead—escalates via Daniel’s accumulating fragments and the discovery of his own crossed-out name. One clear tightening: the ledger forces the choice between reclaiming identity or completing the erasure. The cost is felt in the act of tearing the page and sealing it away. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidences resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode vs harmonize—tightens once when Elias realizes the riddle is a ledger he must add to. Escalation is Accumulative: voices layer, pages dissolve, shell glows, each intensifying cost. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves. Felt price (blank shell, lost journal) is on-page. Sufficient for 8.8 band but micro-turn could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—save Lumina’s fluid soul from gridlock—is signaled early and tightened when Elira embeds the chip: she trades her insider access for guerrilla cartography. One meaningful escalation: developers’ dawn arrival narrows options, forcing the mural-as-foundation gambit. Cost is the irreversible betrayal of her mainland identity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten around preservation vs. industry; each glow from the canister forecloses negotiation and counts visible cost until closing shot. No reversals, yet the single escalation loop—dawn light + drone hum—crystallizes stance under coherent lunar pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—ship’s safe departure—tightens once when Elias chooses to intervene despite personal cost. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each beat narrows from detection to correction to silent exit. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence complicates visibility but does not resolve. The price (renounced recognition) is legible but understated, keeping the score just below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“to find where the rivers begin”—is signaled by the falcon’s page and escalates when the lake itself offers the answer. One decisive tightening: the ice invites rather than resists, forcing Lena to choose irreversible entry. Cost is the forfeiture of her prior life, legible in the paper’s dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restore the town’s heartbeat—is signaled early; escalation is the thickening texture of ghost-sounds and light, tightening until the child’s laughter crystallizes the revival. Cost is the tuner’s bodily exhaustion and the arch’s precarious hold, visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: harness the hush to rewrite guilt. Pressure tightens via oxygen countdown and dying signal; the decisive turn is uncorking the vial—agency that trades rescue for internal silence. Cost is explicit: she surfaces mute about the miracle and carries Elias’s voice as haunting perfume.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to rewrite the beginning via the dead’s names—tightens when the lattice unfolds and he must choose one. The blue flicker of the beam marks the decisive intensification: he pays with his father’s name and the prisoners’ futures. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves anything. The cost is visible: the lattice seals, the reef listens, and Elias walks away branded by the warm name in his sleeve.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—repay the debt or lose Vesper forever—is signaled in the second paragraph. Escalation is accumulative: each cameo drains Liora further, tightening options until the bead’s crumble is the only path. Agency remains hers; coincidence never rescues. The price—her permanent dissolution—is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“to carve a path from ruin to reverence”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as each plate-press irrevocably re-stitches the labyrinth, foreclosing retreat; the cost is the unmaking of the old wharf and the ache in Elias’s bones, visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore lost faith—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is accretive: each unearthed bone hums louder, roots guide deeper, seed swells. One decisive tightening: the sapling splits stone, foreclosing the option to leave the valley unchanged. Cost is felt in the cracked relic and the villagers’ now-unavoidable expectation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: preserving anonymity while gifting a new one. Pressure tightens once: from chalk request to irrevocable drop in mailbox. Agency is renunciation—she relinquishes control of the name. Cost is conceptual (loss of ownership) rather than visceral, but legible in the soft *thunk*.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.0)
    Story tension leaps as the flame’s secret pattern forces Elias to stitch then shatter the dome; each beat tightens the noose and forecloses political safe space with felt cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will she release the unsent letter?—is signaled early and tightens through each sensory accumulation. One decisive micro-turn: pressing shard to palm (pain as tether) → letting letter drift. Cost is visible: the shard’s cracks vanish, her own scars smooth, the path of avoidance is foreclosed. Agency drives the escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—grafting meaning onto irreparable loss—tightens when the boy appears and Lena must choose to give away her last anchor (coral). One meaningful deepening: from decoding static to authoring new static. Cost is the ache in her ribs and the emptied hand. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost communal joy—is signaled early and tightened once: the projection risks vanishing at dawn, forcing Liora to share it now. Agency is hers; coincidence does not resolve. Cost is legible—the film’s inevitable fade—though the escalation is a single intensification rather than a reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—exchange certainty for curiosity—is signaled early and tightened each time the murals ripple. Agency is high: pressing coin to sculpture, painting a door. Cost is visible (loss of prior self-definition) but could be sharper on the page; the fig-woman’s “Again?” hints at cyclical price yet remains abstract. Escalation is pattern-based rather than causal, fitting the Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening suffices, but a more visceral forfeiture would push this above 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“guard the untaxable spark”—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Auditors begin uprooting gardens. Agency is visible: Elias swaps dandelion for rosemary, then pockets the final seed, each choice narrowing options with felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: “turn war-rot into star-bread”—pressure tightens from new war drums to louder singing. One spiral intensification suffices: her decision to amplify lullabies flowers rifles into poppies, exacting vocal and vascular strain “metallic tang of verses not yet bled.”

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. silence the forgotten names—is signaled early and tightens through the chime’s escalating song. The single decisive turn (breaking the chime) narrows options irreversibly. Cost is visible in the splintered bamboo and the sunlight that exposes the library’s hollowness.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring broken promises before dawn—looms from torchlight arrival; the tightening, charged song at climax narrows options and reconfigures trust at high cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—harmony vs domination—escalates through revelation that floodgates were deliberate compromise; one pivotal tightening: blueprint on table forecloses all other blueprints. Cost visible in elders' hesitating fingertips.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Elias risk trusting sound again—is signaled by the letter and tightened when he whispers “Find him.” The returned scrap of sheet music forces the trade-off: imperfect hum or eternal silence. Cost is visible in the rusty, wrong notes he lets himself sing.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: recover Liora vs. accept her chosen threshold. Escalation tightens once: maze search → sinkhole descent. Cost is Elias’s relinquished authorship over the labyrinth. Pressure remains coherent under Situational lens; coincidence (finding logbook) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving belonging as frequency—is signaled early and tightened through the luminous respite countdown. Agency is renunciation: Elara stays, Kael leaves, both accepting the ocean’s cadence. One meaningful intensification suffices; no reversals required. Cost is felt in the parting and the feather’s final placement.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering what’s lost before memory dissolves—is signaled early and tightened when the bird writes “hurry.” Escalation is accretive: each shard narrows her stance until acceptance forecloses retrieval. Cost is felt in the cut thumb and the geode’s sealing. Agency drives the final step; coincidence (bird) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    One dominant stake—composing serendipity until pattern and audience click—escalates as wave-torch-gasp alignments narrow options. Agency is renunciation: Lior refuses coin-acceptance at felt cost (tide-clock running, stars finite). Pressure obeys Accumulate/Deepen curve; no external reversal needed.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transform exile into agency via cosmic inscription—tightens through each beat. Pressure escalates by accretion: nostalgia ban, moonstone hunger, garden’s held breath. The final stance crystallizes with visible cost: skin no longer hers alone. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding value in the mundane—tightens when the stone’s ripples translate into wind-shift and tide; the cost is the knowledge that the harbor will forget, yet Elias endures that loss. One clear escalation: mist thickens, prism flare reveals boat, day begins—options narrow from private communion to public labor. Agency is attention itself, renouncing any larger claim on the world.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to hand pain forward without harm—is signaled early and tightened through the box ritual; the drawing and photo constitute a decisive, costly choice that forecloses silence. Pressure grows under an Accumulative/Textural lens: each handling of the box deepens the emotional weight until release. No coincidence resolves the conflict; agency is Elias’s alone.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—can hope be encoded before obliteration—tightens when the gauge’s needle spins, forcing her to risk total loss for a lateral breakthrough. One meaningful deepening suffices: tide rises, decorations either dissolve or ascend, crystallizing her stance. Cost is legible: the cracked gauge face and surrendered charcoal are persistent constraints that shape the final image. Agency remains hers; coincidence merely complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to map or to remember—tightens when the mural demands Elias sketch faces instead of lines. The cost is the irrevocable shift from observer to participant; the corridor’s song confirms the price. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; no reversals needed. Coincidence (mother’s eyes in negative) complicates, does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—trading stolen heartbeats for fragile hope—tightens once: the soldier’s ache and the mother’s tears are the visible price. No reversals, but the cadence shift from luminous vision to vanishing mirrors narrows Liora’s future to “empty pockets.” Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; coincidence complicates (the heartbeat could fail) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“the price of stopping”—is signaled early and tightened when Kael’s hand shakes over the blade. One meaningful turn: the signature forecloses immediate violence and reweights the cost of future betrayal. Agency is Veyra’s; coincidence only complicates. Price is visible in the soft notch and the rain that will wash the terrace clean.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake established by line one: how to reconcile ownership of engineered drought with stewardship of last living trace. Escalation is accretive: each paragraph sharpens the choice—crack-map guides the walk, egg warms in pocket, final release forges before/after. No reversals needed; pressure tightens through pattern accumulation until renunciation becomes inevitable. The thunder’s lull acts as a metronomic deadline tightening the final step.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—defying conformity’s silence—launches clearly and escalates as each loosened thread tightens existential risk ("They will call you traitor"). A single deepening suffices for length, but the price is mostly atmospheric rather than a concrete loss Liora can no longer access.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—ethical storytelling versus manipulation—tightens when the miner’s rage exposes the cost of Elias’s “half-lit” method. Escalation is one deepening: from confident puppeteer to man who “let the puppets stumble.” Visible price: the miner’s accusation and Elias’s loss of certainty. Agency drives the turn; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving the forgotten names—tightens once when Elira chooses reconfiguration over hoarding. The cost is the card’s dissolution and the rope’s irrevocable change. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues. The single deepening suffices for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes launch early—dream‐path kidnaps another self—then tighten when the terminal declares sacrifice of certainty; resonant escalation without multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—covenant with the unknown—tightens when the tile’s cipher forces descent; the cost is the abandonment of empirical certainty; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—release resentment or remain bound—is signaled early and tightened when Kael demands why the pin was broken. One decisive deepening: Lior reinserts the pin, foreclosing vengeance. Cost is the relinquishing of the box and the years it symbolized. Agency drives every turn; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: erase the boundary between earth and memory to rejoin the lost brother. Escalation is one deepening: fog thickens → sextant bends → mirror opens → sky becomes door. Each step narrows options until only dissolution remains. Cost is palpable: the sextant liquefies, the self disperses into starlight.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elias must reach the Library before the traveler—escalates because each beat narrows his margin: first theft, then manipulation, finally loss of self. Agency chain remains lucid under escalating pauses and reversers (backward-ticking watch). A single meaningful tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—retrieve sister vs. rescue all erased names—tightens once when Liora chooses the latter, foreclosing escape. Pressure grows via accumulative pattern: each mirrored face and crossed-out name increases the moral cost. The price (loss of the ship, indefinite guardianship) is visible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate confusion into clarity—tightens through each braid-reconfiguration; the final merge forecloses archival objectivity with felt conceptual cost. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the last unbroken verse—tightens when the beings’ song threatens it. One meaningful deepening: resistance becomes invitation, cost paid by stone’s extinguished glow. Agency clear.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—identity versus archival control—is signaled early and tightens through sensory pressure: each crystal flag’s borrowed memory raises the cost of possession. The decisive turn is the offered memory that forces renunciation; agency remains hers. No external antagonist needed; coincidence complicates (shadow twitches) but does not resolve. The price—leaving no footprints—makes the cost visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled early and tightened by each rocket; the final star-rebirth is not coincidence but the earned rebuttal. One clear escalation beat: the ground itself exhales after the first launch, narrowing options to continue or quit.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant grief-stake is signaled early; the beat of pressing the cicada completes the tightening without ever naming the loss. Cost is the silence she gifts and must bear, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: freedom vs entombment. Each inversion tightens the live window—once every hour—until collapse is inevitable. Cost legible: child’s last sprout costs the father and bunker. Agency driven by cumulative choices, no deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: teaching silence to carry what cannot be spoken. Pressure tightens once—passenger boards, silence must be shaped—then crystallizes in her release. Agency is Elias’s calibrated interventions; cost is the fresh vacancy after she leaves. No external reversals, but the internal deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—break the cycle of power—escalates through each discovery: murals re-route quest, warnings raise cost, throne’s invitation tests resolve. Sunrise deadline tightens decisions; refusal is an earned narrowing of options with visible price (throne destroyed, lore chamber gone).

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep the dead out or release them—tightens through the sanctuary’s literal fade; the final act of stepping through forecloses retreat. Pressure escalates via Accumulative pattern: each burned bridge increases the weight of returning shadows. Cost is visible in the sanctuary’s exhalation and Lior’s irreversible exile.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate pressure into agency without new exploitation—is signaled early and tightened when the bolt’s twist forces a choice: break the loop or become it. Escalation is causal and single-cycle; the price is the bolt’s erasure and the irreversible step into the desert. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is uncovering the dynasty’s “hidden truth.” A single meaningful deepening: the ledger is the room itself. Cost is conceptual (the end of the Veyne legacy is proven to be a misreading), felt in Elias’ relinquishing his lifelong self-definition. Progression is subtle, one deepening re-weighting—appropriate for 700 words—but the moment is abstract; visceral price is oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—break silence or remain bound—is signaled in line 1 and tightened when threads cinch his wrists. Escalation is pattern-deepening: each image (moths, threads, program) reweights the cost of speaking. Agency is renunciation of silence via unsnap; price is shadows released and first words spoken. Coincidence (program date smudged) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will keep observing or risk attachment—tightens once when the button forces a decision; the cost is the reopened wound of his own unread history. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens: each artifact adds weight until action becomes inevitable. No coincidence resolves the tension; agency remains Elias’s.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preservation of erased memory—tightens when the Council schedules the final archive burning. One meaningful deepening: the booth’s new date/location forces immediate action. Agency is renunciation rather than direct confrontation; cost is the surrender of personal safety. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; no deus-ex-machina.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—hush the prophecy—tightens through negative-space playing; each note subtracts possibility until the prophecy is folded into his ribs. Cost is visible: the grotto resists, the mist presses, the audience sits in stricken silence. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decoding the leaves’ prophecy—tightens when the moonstone unlocks their language, forcing a climb that forecloses safe return. Escalation is driven by her agency: each seed selected and monument built raises stakes until the arbor answers with a ladder.

Visible price on page is light but thematically scaled.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake—protecting the eye from those who would “cure” truth—escalates cleanly; truffles-for-silence trade narrows options, and final burial permanently ends leverage warlords can exert; cost sits on page.

Escalation is accretive rather than causal: each sensory layer (smoke, thrum, honey) deepens the question until the stance crystallizes. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, capping below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: whether Lena can risk opening again. Pressure tightens once—Elias offers the second tooth, forcing her to accept or refuse connection. The tightening is driven by her micro-choice to press the seed and accept the tooth; cost is the blood and the audible hush. No coincidence resolves; the seedling’s break is earned, not lucky.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to coexist with a ghost that remembers you—tightens when the bird strikes its reflection and the book dissolves into mirrors. Escalation is driven by Lior’s micro-choices (shielding with the sundial, opening the door) under Accumulative pressure. Cost is legible: he relinquishes the bird and the library’s safety. One more beat of external consequence would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: whether Liora will surrender her final personal secret. Pressure tightens once—from external offering to self-offering—under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: relinquishing the private letter she “never sent” forecloses the option to keep it. No external reversals, but the deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: prove humanity is not a pawn. Pressure tightens once—signal’s pattern → Liora’s counter-melody → signal’s curious shift—each step narrows options and raises social cost. Agency is hers; coincidence complicates but does not save. The final silence on campus is a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the living key to unseal the city’s true blueprint—faces escalating spatial mutiny that turns the chamber into a hostile organism. The tightening beat occurs when the compass pivots toward Elias’s chest, forcing a life-or-map choice. Cost: he trades personal safety and anonymity for civic rebirth. Escalation is causal and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: give erased dead a witnessed name. One decisive intensification—vision of Liora’s struggle—compresses pressure and solidifies Elias’s stance. Agency drives the tightening; external silence does not resolve conflict, only crystallizes cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ancestral honor vs. safety—is signaled early and tightened when the nail’s pulse overrides Liora’s order. The decisive act (pressing nail to glass) narrows options irreversibly; the cost is the shattered window and lost nail. Pressure escalates under causal agency; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—escape from the story you’ve been given—is signaled in the hitchhiker’s promise of “amnesty carved from the bones of never.” Pressure tightens when the glass reveals the lattice of unchosen paths; the glowing thread forces a single irrevocable choice. Cost is visible: the world behind Elias seals shut. The escalation is driven by his agency—thumb on glass, bow to string, step through—without reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep circling or to leave something behind—is signaled in the opening paragraph and tightened through each artifact Elias handles. The single meaningful escalation occurs when he pockets the lira, then chooses to walk away; that act forecloses both theft and flight. Pressure is accumulative: every object reiterates the same question until the choice becomes unavoidable. Cost is visible in the deliberate discard of the cigarette and the unhurried shadow stretching across the tracks.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the temple to recover his sister—is signaled early and tightens when the star pulses “Witness.” One meaningful deepening occurs as he realizes the temple is a loom, not a vault; this reweights his goal from deciphering to participating. Cost is felt in the dissolution of his life’s work (the ledger), though the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover what the lake hides—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the plant forces the confession that redefines the loss from “taken” to “chosen.” Escalation is causal: each swirl answers the seed’s hunger, narrowing options until Eldrin’s only path is renunciation. Cost is visible in the withered plant and the burning key.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—un-eclipse the covenant—tightens when future-Liora declares it “not ready,” foreclosing premature victory. Each scar-burn narrows the maze options, turning internal pressure into external constraint. The cost is palpable: three days rooted to soil on the first attempt, and now the timetable mismatch. No coincidence resolves the conflict; Liora’s agency alone reconfigures the covenant’s accessibility.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—guilt vs. self-forgiveness—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when the roots extract the child’s name. One meaningful deepening: the orchard’s trade redefines Liora’s future. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is visceral and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding worth after failure—tightens when the scrap forces Liam to choose between appraisal detachment and personal claim. The escalation is textural: each sensory echo increases the cost of remaining a spectator. The final choice forecloses the path of certainty with visible cost (the truck’s headlights as unanswered question).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition without rupture—tightens once: the seed’s planting forces a literal “bending” that costs Elias permanent exile from the new state. Escalation is single but decisive; agency drives the climb and invocation. Cost is legible in the final beat: he must leave the restored wife to translate further.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to keep wonder alive in routine—tightens when the woman demands the “almost” spoon; Elias’s choice to surrender tomorrow’s first second visibly forecloses his prior hoarding. Pressure is coherent, one deepening, no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—birth the radiance or keep the bunker sealed—is signaled early and tightens through each shell confession; the final act forecloses return to the bunker with felt cost (“pearl was gone”). Agency is present but abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens through graffiti clues that force a choice: left for bravery, right for sorry; the final turn right narrows options and carries the cost of never looking back, legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“document the unspoken before the second letter erases regret”—is signaled early and tightens once when the second letter posts; the cost (library’s collapse, watch’s silence) is visible, though escalation is more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—deliver or destroy violin—tightens via midnight deadline and plant warnings. One meaningful deepening: prophecy shifts from two paths to third (shatter now). Cost is loss of fortune and self-branding as “madwoman,” felt on page. Agency drives escalation; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“capture one last spark”—tightens when the doorway offers exchange instead of escape. One meaningful deepening: mirror reveals the cost is bearing witness, not rescue. Agency is decision to reach through; price is chip’s spent light. Pressure grows under Accumulative lens as static density increases.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finding the “source before the drawing”—is signaled early and tightened when the shoot dissolves into her veins, foreclosing passive peace. Cost is visceral: the grotto trembles, vines recoil, hairpin vanishes. Escalation is one decisive intensification under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias can relinquish borrowed certainties—is signaled early and tightened by each unhooked knot. Agency is continuous: every tug dissolves a specific regret and narrows his future role. The cost is visible in the dissolving threads and the flickering beam. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals are needed.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to teach vanishing—tightens once when Elias decides to withhold the answer until the student can read the rings; the cost is the further loss of his own years, a visible price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: keep the flock’s harmony intact without revealing the self. A single meaningful tightening: “movement was a confession.” Felt cost is hinted—stillness becomes the skimmer’s cage—but lacks a concrete forfeiture on-page to reach the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“can the mechanized world admit stubborn light?”—tightens from ascent to rejection. The candle’s roar pays the visible price of irreconcilable opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform perception or remain trapped in literal silence—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: each hue Elias almost recognizes tightens the noose until he must choose to create color. The cost is the irreversible alteration of his own senses, paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save meaning/self from universal silence—escalates via harmonic narrowing into one irreversible choice. The tightening beat: arranging the spiral forecloses the option of passive witness; afterwards only dissolution or reversal remain. Cost is tangible—"dissolve into silence" versus becoming “a question”. One tightening is sufficient; resonance high.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—naming the nameless—tightens once: each crystallized fear forecloses anonymity and births a predator. The reaper’s agency is absolute; coincidence never rescues. The visible price is the atlas now irretrievably inside him and the world newly unsafe.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—“right the cosmic imbalance” of a tideless world—escalates when drops falter, the bell fails to hum, and the bay responds with gull cries and rippling fish. The pressure tightens once through Elias’s decisive final strike that forecloses any option for further retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to carry the drowned town—tightens when Elias moves from nailing photos to burning them, foreclosing the option of eternal guardianship. Pressure is accumulative: each nailed image raises the weight until the burning releases it. Cost is the ashes on the water, visible and felt. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—signaled in “the way fire danced when fed by unseen winds.” Escalation is a single crescendo: fire swallows the older-than-light dew; tension does not plateau. No return possible after flame turns blue; exit cost etched physically into altered veins.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—prevent weaponized silence—is signaled in the mentor’s voice and charged by the prototype’s weight. Escalation is a single deepening: from isolated vigil to active intervention, foreclosing the option to remain hidden. The price is the irreversible exposure of her presence (boot-prints) and the lifelong corrosion of secrecy. No coincidence resolves; the wind complicates but does not save.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—self-integrity versus legal erasure—tightens once: the custody hearing countdown forces the irreversible merger. Escalation is causal and visible: each pulse of the jarred brain raises the cost of delay. The final image (banners burning) externalizes the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding a space for slow, unsettling growth—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when business slows to a halt. Agency lies in Elias’s renunciation; the cost is visible in empty appointment slots and shared vigil. No coincidence resolves; pressure coheres under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—tightens when the blower fails and Elias must choose between louder artifice or vulnerable presence. The single meaningful deepening (real laughter erupting above) is driven by his prior choices and carries visible cost: the blower’s death and his relinquished role. No reversals needed; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep knowledge caged vs. free it—tightens when the librarian offers “boundaries of light.” The pendant’s weight and the hum escalate pressure; handing it over forecloses the guardian path with irreversible cost. No reversals, but the single deepening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—interrupt stifling destiny—tightens as Elias trades memories & doubt for unmaking the past; visible price is the erasure of his scars and guild exile. Single escalation: from feeding doubt to final refusal of ashes-cage, agency intact, no off-stage rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—tuning the unheard frequency—tightens once when Elara realizes the message is the listening itself; cost is the shattering dish and the irreversible internalization of the note. Agency drives escalation: she chooses to jump, renouncing gravity as assumption. The lunar perigee functions as live clock, but its pressure is more atmospheric than tactical, keeping the score just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent the ferry’s unraveling—is signaled in the radio warning and escalates via Lira’s pattern-merging gambit, which costs her the grotto route forever. Agency is continuous: every adjustment of wheel or hourglass narrows options until the irreversible merge. Coincidence (grotto collapse) complicates but does not resolve; the resolution arises from Lira’s stance crystallization with visible exile as price.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is singular: to prove memory is communal property through irrevocable exhibition. Pressure tightens once when dismantling is confirmed; Elias chooses to weave anyway. Escalation is textural—each eruption layers sensory overload rather than causal reversal—but remains coherent under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible when the void ends in quotidian emptiness, a clear tightening under the inferred mode.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: replace abyssal darkness with star-navigation. Pressure escalates by texture—each mention of the aliens or elder resistance tightens the choice until one crystallizing look-up forces commitment. Cost: permanent rupture with abyss tradition visible in Kael’s shallow breath.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—protecting forgotten voices—tightens when the mist threatens to erase the woman and child. One decisive intensification: touching the glove unleashes the collective scream, forcing Elias from passive listening to active witness. Cost is legible in the dead hearing aid and the irreversible knowledge of his own erased past.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve and bear witness to the unremembered—is signaled early and tightened by the tidal clock. The phase seam crossing is the single decisive escalation that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible in the “weight of the invisible light in his bones,” though the price could be more viscerally dramatized. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence merely complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—identity erasure vs. cosmic connection—is signaled by the death certificate in paragraph 2. Escalation is Accumulative: each defragmented file tightens the pattern until the heartbeat sync forecloses the option of reclaiming her bureaucratic self. The cost is the certificate left forever unresolved. No coincidence resolves; pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—capture the dying language—is signaled early and escalates through the diamond’s pulse and the birds’ collapse. One decisive tightening: the moment Veyra answers the canyon, options vanish and cost becomes irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—bitterness vs. cosmic assimilation—tightens once the arrowhead becomes seed. Agency: Elias chooses laughter/assimilation, foreclosing rescue of sister. Cost is visceral (body woven from roots). Pressure escalates via garden’s response and static phone; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (“to reawaken beauty vs machine routine”) signaled early. Tightening occurs when her heart-signal cracks the earth and statues grind toward her, forcing her final stance—keep playing, then renounce surveillance. Cost visible: brass gears shed, statues lose human form, personal instrument left behind, proving escalation under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: deliver a storm that maps broken promises. Stakes tighten when Lira shows that the letters are “waiting,” not lost; choice narrows to—carry this weight forever or abandon Lira. One credible reversal: storm’s revelation shifts mission from “heal” to “remember.” Cost is visible in Elias’s compulsion to cross borders anew—price paid before the reader’s eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transform unspoken grief into a living artifact. Escalation tightens once—finding the fragment, then the woman—cost appears when he trades solitary silence for collaborative creation. Coincidence (the oasis car) complicates, not resolves. The price is internal yet legible: relinquishing the mythic completeness of perfect silence for communal imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“how to reawaken memories”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the scarf dissolves and Elias must decide to share the living archive. Cost is visible (loss of sole possession) yet could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recover or release the runaway dream—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation tightens through failed photograph, living image, and final refusal; the cost is the librarian’s self-imposed exile from certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to open the prison of fear—is signaled by the man’s demand and tightened when the map reveals the girl’s unasked question. Escalation is one deepening: from physical lock to conceptual prison. Protagonist’s agency drives the turn; cost is the loss of her rule-bound certainty. No external reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—the value of one’s memories versus the temptation to shed them—grows tighter with each sensory proof in the water. The micro-turn surfaces when Elias realizes the gaps are “spaces held open,” a causal deepening that forces the final stance: embrace the stolen weight.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—teaching Kael how to return—tightens when the shadow tests the room’s angles. Escalation: shadow lunge → binding annotation → library’s sigh. Agency is Kael’s tracing; cost is the shadow’s contained hunger and Elspeth’s withheld warning. One meaningful deepening suffices. Coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—tightens when Elias realizes the seed must leave his hands; the cost is exile. Agency drives escalation: each graft and cut foreshadows the final gift of color. One decisive turn at the veil narrows options irreversibly. Coincidence (girl’s appearance) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to bind or free the drowned—tightens once: the last knot. Elias’s agency drives the escalation; no coincidence resolves it. The cost (loss of the town’s illusion of peace) is visible in the fogged mirrors and unlatched doors. One decisive deepening suffices and lands.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether the unknown is void or conversation—tightens through each reel comparison; the deepening pattern of shifting shadows and flickers narrows her stance until she chooses listening over crossing, with felt cost in the withheld step.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“to understand the physics of letting go”—is signaled early and tightened when the globe’s snow reverses gravity. One decisive intensification: the upward snowfall forces Liora to recognize the cost of knowledge and choose silence. Agency is renunciation; the price is the lie she will live with. Coincidence (impossible globe) complicates rather than resolves, consistent with Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“translate or be consumed”—is signaled in the radio whisper and tightens when the ghost presses into his ribs. One decisive tightening: the spiral question → the rest-symbol refusal, paid for by seared palm and courtyard scream. Agency is clear; no external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the spire yield meaning or only cold—tightens floor by floor. Cipher diary and rising elevator create coherent pressure; final “Look up” forces stance crystallization with visible cost (acceptance of perpetual cold). No coincidences resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving the sky remembers—tightens once when Elias chooses surrender over rescue. Escalation is accretive: each cloud-memory increases emotional cost until the fall becomes inevitable. Price is felt in the forfeiture of return.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—containment versus surrender—tightens once: from carving faces to carving light. The single deepening (realizing the guild’s containment failed) forces her final stance. Cost is visible in the collapsing ceiling and the blank page that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—escape the temporal loop—signalled in paragraph four. Escalation is one tightening: recognition of pattern → collective jump → release. Agency is Liora’s pattern-mapping; cost is weeks of drift and implied reprimand. Coincidence (starlings) complicates but does not resolve. Pressure coherent under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve what the eclipse stole—is signaled in paragraph 3. Escalation is causal: each gear turned tightens the clock, foreclosing the option to leave empty-handed. The tightening culminates in the hum of the mirror and the dissolution of the child—visible price. No coincidence resolves; the door opens because she completes the mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turn war-scarred planet into nebula of respite—is signaled early and tightened through collective labor. One meaningful escalation: ringing the bell shifts from personal ritual to cosmic response. Cost is visible in Liora’s chalked “We stay,” foreclosing departure. Pressure coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep stalling doomsday or release the stolen lullaby—tightens once, decisively, when Elias chooses release. The cost is immediate and visible: his own thread cut. Pressure grows under the Accumulative lens via density of song and hush rather than causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—guide travelers at personal cost—tightens once when Liora sacrifices her last escape nut. Pressure escalates under causal lens: each nut left reduces her own margin, culminating in irreversible renunciation. No coincidence resolves; the girl’s freedom is paid by Liora’s permanent entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—signaled early via the chrysalis label “Emergence.” One meaningful tightening: the insight that separation is pause, not end, dissolves the need to build and forecloses the bridge-building path. Cost is the physical loss of the chrysalis and the emotional unclenching of grief. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—selling silence—tightens in a single, visible beat: the patron’s hunger vs Liora’s choice to keep the moonlight. Cost is legible (the fracture replaces loss with captured absence), but absence cannot wound on the page like a missing eye; intensity feels moderate rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to off-load the soldier’s remorse before it drowns him—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened when he kneels to pour. One decisive act narrows options: once the memory is given, it cannot be reclaimed. Cost is visible in the moment the soldier’s face vanishes and Elias’s tongue goes “clean.” Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring intelligible labor rhythms—is signaled early and tightened when Liora presses the engraved weight into Elias’s hand, foreclosing the option of continued silence. Escalation is one meaningful turn: from fracture to tentative bridge. Cost is the bottle and the public vulnerability of singing on the dock.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaim abandoned memories—tightens via escalating synaptic feedback that narrows Lena’s options to endure or be overwritten. The final reconfiguration exacts the price of self-dissolution, legible in her warm-blooded grip on the broken mirror.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover lost knowledge to find her brother—tightens when the threshold collapses and only one seed escapes. Agency drives escalation: Lysara chooses silence, plants the seed, accepting indefinite wait. The hour-long clock and blank manuscript are visible prices that alter tactics. Coincidence complicates (gravity inversion) but never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—give grief an audible voice in a mute world—is signaled early and deepened through each strum and crack analysis. Escalation comes as texture thickens: silence becomes waiting, then shared lament. Cost is felt in the insulator’s tear-glaze and Elias’s decision to abandon the relic rather than own it; agency drives climax though external stakes remain interior.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—beauty in difficult silence—tightens as each tremor translates into potential sacrifice; Elias’s refusal-into-renunciation costs him his habitual distance, visibly paid when he hands the worry stone away.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—what to do when empathy fails—is signaled early and tightens once: the diary’s final entry forces Elias to break his own silence. The cost is the pacifist identity he must renegotiate, visible in the open diary and the sign he posts. No reversals, but one decisive deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can Liora root serenity in perpetual motion?—is signaled early and tightened when the bloom mirrors unspoken fears, forcing her stance crystallization. Escalation is accretive: scent thickens, truths surface, options narrow to acceptance. Cost is communal exposure and personal relinquishment of secrecy. No reversals beyond the single deepening, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes (“find the source of resilience”) escalate cleanly: flight path narrows as water flows upward, fruit hangs like clocks, and Veyra’s body pays the cost when moss invades her pulse. One meaningful tightening—“plant it or lose it”—renders the inversion hour a live clock. Cost is visibly felt in her tingling veins, an embodied price that reshapes next flight vector toward the core.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—prove the wind is intelligent—tightens when the anemometer shatters and the flare buys one heartbeat of stillness. Agency is her decision to run, then to listen; cost is the lost patch and the city’s faster adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—tame vs free the aurora—is signaled in paragraph 7. Each chime tightens the texture and raises the cost: frost melts, silence breaks, elders’ rule dissolves. Agency is Liora’s deliberate “unfetter” strikes. No coincidence; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—integrity of the world-seal—tightens when driftwood quivers and child’s laughter reopens the luring question. Escalation is a deepening: the quiet itself becomes pressure, forcing Elias from defense to navigation of the same current he once dammed. Visible price is the abandonment of guardianship and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode emotion’s math—tightens when the press prints Elias’s own face, forcing a trade-off: keep collecting or become the page. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the dissolution of borrowed safety. No reversals needed; the single crystallizing beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—carry the hum or lose the mentor forever—tightens when the woman crushes the seed and the bridge grows. One decisive turn: courier steps onto living wood, forfeiting personal reunion to become conduit. Cost is visible—he dissolves into the fade, voice merging with the chorus. Pressure escalates under causal lens; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through agency—each reading deepens the cordoned-off options; exfoliating prism redefines cost; renunciation of proof is earned stasis with on-page emotional toll.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—the planet’s resilience as negotiated with its humans—tightens once via the silk’s exchange. Tension climbs each time the smith relinquishes more thread, until final relinquishment forecloses the silk forever. No extra reversals needed: one decisive heightening, cost visible (“magic spent”), earned under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—discover the withheld truth—is signaled early and escalates through each beat: shard found, seam appears, voice warns, choice crystallizes. One meaningful tightening: the seam snaps shut, forcing Liora to stop looking and start choosing. Cost is felt in the shard’s transformation and her relinquishment of the old map.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—bottling safety—tightens when the fourth letter’s spiral map forces Elias upstairs; each new stone narrows his option to leave. Agency is cumulative: burning letters → climbing stairs → adding rock → lighting candle. Cost is the skiff left to rot, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—control the storm before it controls her—tightens through each pulse of the lantern; the final flare forecloses the shadows’ claim at visible cost (wick burns low, stars waver). Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversals are needed at this length. The silhouette’s want is abstract, slightly muting visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—why stories magnetize people—signaled early and tightened through each village painting session. Escalation is accumulative: each dyed revelation costs pigment, stamina, and ultimately the wing itself. Agency remains with the dye master; no coincidence resolves the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to bear the sextant’s quantified sorrow—tightens once: from discovery to transfer. The pressure deepens as each loosened screw thickens the air, but the final beat is more release than trade-off, so the cost feels diffuse rather than sharply foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—rekindling a dying realm—is signaled early and escalates through each shard of song she risks. One decisive tightening: when her voice cracks and the trees shudder, she must give more blood and memory. The price is visceral (throat burning, self-dissolution) and alters the realm’s options irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—guilt vs. accountability—escalates via the invitation and mirrored confrontation. Tightening occurs when Lena realizes the library is a threshold, not refuge. Cost is legible: she forfeits twelve years of safety. Pressure plateaus slightly in the mirror chamber, holding it under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“will the city keep adjusting?”—is signaled early and tightened when Liora’s loaves force confrontation with memory. One decisive intensification: wheat erupts overnight, foreclosing denial. Cost is visible in the guards’ abandonment of posts and the prince’s muddy boots.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—extract meaning before oblivion—tightens with each collapsing shelf and unrecorded vow. The decisive turn is Elias’s choice to cross the bridge, trading the safety of measurement for the risk of reunion; the cost is the library’s erasure. Escalation is accumulative: density of loss increases until the final cadence shift. No external coincidence; pressure is coherent and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—escalates through each feint until the final crack narrows Lena’s path to silent witness. Agency is hers: the ledger, map, and rival are all deployed to force Veyne’s betrayal. Cost is felt in the harbor’s inevitable dawn reckoning.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Lira remain observer or become the weather—signaled early. One decisive tightening: compass points at her reflection, forcing recognition. Cost is the loss of separateness; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via intensifying taste and light. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices. Agency is renunciation/acceptance that forecloses the old identity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncork suppressed creativity—tightens once when the lock’s click forces the choice to paint. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; the cost is the irreversible step into color and the forfeiture of the safe grey world. No reversals needed; one decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias can bear the cost of ungilded honesty—is signaled early and tightened at each beat: allergy → map → Archive → writing raw. The decisive tightening occurs when he presses the plate and the letters demand voice; this forecloses the option of returning to ornamental lies. Cost is visible: he sacrifices his livelihood and identity as gilder. Escalation is causal and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder via destruction of the ice—is signaled early and tightened by each chime. The single decisive intensification (fracture-bloom to shatter) narrows options to irrevocable loss. Cost is felt, though external pressure remains abstract rather than embodied antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect vs. destroy the farm—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the box re-activates grief, forcing the burn. Escalation is causal: magnetic shift → mines unstable → burn required. Cost is visible: 127 years of work reduced to ash, caretaker role forfeited. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the match is struck by agency.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—Elena’s unheard voice—tightens once when the letter appears; the courtyard’s collective gasp crystallizes the cost of decades of silence. Agency is shared, not Mira’s alone, so the pressure feels diffused yet still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode or drown the past—tightens once: the dice sequence triggers the failsafe, forcing the dance-password. Escalation is textural (water rising, lights flickering) yet agency remains Lira’s; cost is the lab’s loss and her bodily risk.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“to exhume her”—is declared early and relentlessly tightened from wildflower curl to stone dissolution. One decisive deepening: knowledge that memories are not lost but *taken* forecloses easy grief and reroutes him toward ledger-search with mortal cost already tasted. Agency stays internal; pressure never dissipates.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“to hush the prophecy”—is signaled early and tightened when the thread escapes; the summoner’s agency shifts from pursuit to acceptance, foreclosing further chase. The cost (burned palm, tattered wing) is visible and alters tactics. Escalation is single but decisive under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—“to learn the language of old buildings”—pressures Elias into an unbreakable contract; the cost (becoming steward-seducer of future learners) is implied, but not viscerally suffered on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve identity against erasure—is signaled in paragraph four and tightens through each memory sacrificed. The archive act forecloses retreat; patrol arrival crystallizes stance. Cost is visceral (emptied chest, arrest) and escalates under Accumulative lens: each memory increases lattice power until the garden itself resists. No coincidence resolves; patrol hesitation is earned by radiant light.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—undoing the regime’s lethal decrees—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the thorn crumbles; the single meaningful turn is the Emperor’s request to be taught, which forecloses the path of vengeance. Pressure grows under causal lens: each forged decree now must be unmade, and the cost is the forger’s identity as traitor-turned-teacher. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the Emperor’s surrender is earned by the visible dissolution of his own authority.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“why do I echo?”—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened by each disclosure. Progressive descent forces stance crystallization: Kaelis’s attempt to ensure silence collides with Veyra’s agency. Cost is visible in the snapped threads and the hush that follows. One meaningful turn suffices; no escalation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—salvaging what’s pure from wreckage—tightens when the widow’s grief is re-aimed from wrong ghost to living child. Agency is Lena’s deliberate exposure of the truth via the globe; cost is her continued solitude. Pressure escalates through sensory intensification, not external twists. No coincidence resolves; glacier’s laughter only underscores earned shift.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—seeing hidden effort—is signaled early; the single tightening occurs when Liora’s whistle makes the minnows surface, forcing her recognition. Cost is legible in her sudden bodily awareness and Kael’s relinquishing of the whisk, though the pressure curve is gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs survival—tightens when Elias realizes the stillpoint is a quarantine valve. One decisive turn: he kneels and accepts unspooling instead of exposing the lie. Cost is immediate—his body dissolves—visible in the aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to serve the dawn or master it—is signaled early and tightens when the silhouette with too many fingers appears. Escalation is causal: each transmission raises cost until Elias’s decisive act forecloses the passive path. Price is the wailing chorus and the bruised dawn itself.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent sphere resonance—tightens once: ice thinning → must tune or world breaks. Agency is hers; cost is cellular unraveling. One clear escalation, no safety valves.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove that patience itself is revolutionary—is signaled early and tightened when the viaduct’s tremor shifts from resistance to surrender. One meaningful deepening suffices: the ice’s groan becomes “a thousand drawn bows,” narrowing options to step forward or retreat. The cost is the solitude of that step; no external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—protect urban memory from erasure—intensifies once and lands on the page as explicit choice to archive. Tightening occurs with brick wall’s new mortar and trickle warning; no reset, no off-stage rescue. Cost (drowning risk) is legible. One meaningful pressure point suffices; no excess reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—turn apology into action—is signaled early and tightened when Elias seals the first letter. Agency drives escalation: each turn (winding heart, soldering box, mailing letter) narrows options and raises social-emotional cost. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the storm complicates but does not decide. Persistent constraint: the heart’s steady pulse keeps time against his hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—achieve unheard bell frequency—signaled early; each crash escalates cost (new joints, melted arrow). The final “conducting” moment tightens options: workshop lost, path foreclosed, irreverent awe chosen. Pressure grows under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering the erased—escalates from curiosity to existential risk. The single tightening beat (crystal upload) forecloses retreat and triggers the termination flag; the price is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will intervene—tightens once when he decides to step onto the ice. The cost is the abandonment of his lifelong stance as passive peacekeeper; pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without external reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—postpone the booked appointment—narrows each interim choice; ice splits force the real crossing whose success reweights survival and forecloses suicide path ending; stakes stay legible without external coincidences.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coils from the abandoned bus-clock and the vineyard’s “pleading” roots; a quiet act—folding the letter into heart-pocket—tightens stakes and renounces storm-seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the echo of wisdom against the prophet’s fire—is signaled early and tightened through sensory erosion. One meaningful deepening: the clearing’s borders blur, forcing her to act. Cost is felt in the parapet’s fading song and her own exhaustion. Agency is endurance; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    The single dominant stake—collective grief reframed into bearable memory—tightens each time she handles an artifact or waits for light. No false reversals: every beat either adds density or crystallizes the final constellation; the cost is the shared exposure in the bakery’s window.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding why language has ceased—tightens when Elias realizes growth has gone underground. One decisive deepening: the silences between reversed words reveal a living pulse. Agency: he chooses collaboration over isolation, foreclosing solitary study. Cost is the relinquished sanctuary of the library.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will keep chasing echoes or relinquish them—tightens once when the dancer moves and the tape speaks; the cost is the snapped arrows and the silence that follows, a visible forfeiture under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—harness the ephemeral or lose the observatory—is signaled early and tightened when Elias must decide at the tower. One decisive deepening: syncing pulse with the hand forecloses the option of stasis. Cost is visible in the open-shutter mind that can no longer freeze moments.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single dominant stake—giving a flawless goodbye despite cure-death—escalates not by catastrophe but by cost visible in Lena’s refusal to prolong false dawn. Agency crystallizes in silent music that denies hope itself. No external antagonist necessary; pressure is existential, coherence intact. The tightening makes the renunciation the only plausible act.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“where do shadows go?”—is signaled early and escalates through each key turn. The tightening beat is the second keyhole shaped like a sundial gnomon, forcing a choice that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: the isle tilts, the key burns to ash, and Elara risks becoming a noon-shadow herself.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering her brother—signaled early via the burned reed-body. Tightening occurs when the tooth dissolves and the changeling sheds its skin; options narrow to “make it right.” Cost is the permanent crack in certainty and the needle’s lingering hum. Pressure stays causal and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to keep light without fire—tightens once when the child appears demanding apprenticeship. The cost is the surrender of exclusive custodianship, felt as Liora presses the warm shard into small hands.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake is emotional repair after public confession; pressure tightens when Lena proffers the pendant. The quiet escalation works but lacks a sharper reversal testing her bravery beyond renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will master or yield to the story’s current—is signaled early and tightened through accumulating cameos that strip his agency. One decisive deepening: when the faceless figure accuses “you never let us breathe,” Elias’s surrender forecloses any future resistance. Cost is visible on page: physical dissolution and loss of bodily autonomy. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“the arbor dies if the last note fades”—is signaled early and tightened through Mira’s cracked first note to the final verse. One meaningful escalation: the vines’ audible unfurling narrows her option to finish the song despite throat-burn. Cost is visible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into a map that outlasts endings—is signaled early and tightened once: the single drop of blood and the whispered seal foreclose the option of ever retrieving the starlight for herself. Pressure grows through accretion of discarded fragments until the final reconfiguration. Cost is visible in her cracked skin and the snow settling like unfinished stories.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve waning echoes—tightens once: reverse-engineering successes prise open the past but make nothing new, heightening scarcity of wounded season. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; cost (daughter’s dwindling patience) signaled but less visceral than mechanic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elira’s need to unload burdens—tightens when the grotto demands she become the loom instead. The pressure deepens via pattern accumulation rather than causal reversal; the cost is her human boundary.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to live beside absence—tightens when she withholds the last carving, trading market coin for private ritual. Escalation is accretive: each blank consumed, each lion released, until the final refusal forecloses the selling path. Cost is visible in cold tea and aching joints. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—refusing to let younger selves follow—tightens when ghosts surface and demand accountability. Escalation is accretive: each camera frame adds pressure until the blank frame voids the possibility of reconstruction. Cost is visceral: surrender to the lagoon’s memory. Agency remains Lira’s; coincidence (ghosts emerging) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—can the town salvage belief in departure?—is signaled early and tightened when Lena repurposes the terminal into a bridge, trading escape for passage. One clear escalation: the sextant’s redirection of water pressure triggers doors and redefines options. Cost is visible on the page: the spaceport stays grounded. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will he release the abandoned dream?—is signaled early and tightened once: the fracture spreads and he chooses to assemble the orrery “as they had always wanted to be.” Cost is the literal shattering of the elders’ sacred forecourt and the audible loss of silence. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding vs. relinquishing her father’s lies—tightens when she drops the ledger; the option to decode is foreclosed. Pressure grows through reflective density rather than external reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible: loss of map and gold. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is preservation vs entropy—rope as archive must be tended or stories drown. Stakes deepen once: discovery that fulgurite “was a ward against the drowning dark” pivots to realization “he’d been saving the sound of them,” pressure tightens to action (tie the knot, splice seed pod). Cost is present: solitude in the fog, loss of anonymity to “secret weavers,” rope now warm compass. No coincidences rescue; final bell buoy tolling is atmospheric motif, not contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—mapping the geography of healing—tightens when Elias shifts from chronicler to seeker, pocketing the locket. Pressure is textural: each sensory layer increases the ache of absence. Cost is conceptual (betrayal of commission) rather than visceral, keeping it just below 8.2. No external antagonist; coincidence (finding locket) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reawakening beauty—tightens as each tool is laid out like sacrament and the egg unfolds into something “not the sky-singer of legend.” One decisive intensification: the creature’s lurching flight forces Aldric to accept imperfection as the price of hope. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—compassion versus inherited fire—tightens when the boy’s cut forces Liora to test her ethos in public view. Escalation is one deepening, not reversal: wound → binding → emblem. Cost is the village’s perpetual doubt, felt in the closing run toward smoke. No coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—is introduced early, and pressure escalates when threads resist extraction, foreclosing non-violent options. The cost (memories tear free with audible city-wide aftermath) is visible, but the escalation is telescoped rather than progressively tightened; one decisive pull replaces incremental tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—share light without fire—tightens once when the gear demands a memory fragment, forcing a trade-off. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens: each sonar ping adds luminous thread until the path solidifies and the old cycle is foreclosed. Cost is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to shape collective grief—tightens when the carver shifts from carving names to carving hollows. One decisive intensification: the crack in the stone forces the tactic change. Cost is felt in the butterfly pressed into his palm and the poem added to the roll.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—forcing the village to feel its unspoken debts—tightens once when Elias slows the clock; the cost is immediate social exile and the audible groan of overburdened gears. Escalation is driven solely by his agency under the Accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves; pressure crystallizes in the lagging chime.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the shape of intentions—tightens with each loosened knot; options narrow as the tapestry breathes and the voices accuse. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; coincidence complicates but never rescues. The price is the knowledge that he must now carry the widow’s secret and confront her, foreclosing his former detachment. One decisive intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—“the future is malleable, a clay pot”—tightens once: hesitation → dot → confirmation; the price—the spire’s song vibrating her bones—makes the cost visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—voice versus silence—tightens when Lira arrives: Elias must choose personal safety or collective resurrection. Escalation is causal: each broadcast raises risk; the girl’s arrival proves the method works and forces the final surrender. Cost is tangible: he loses shelter, tool, identity. No coincidence resolves; the patrols find only aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.7)
    Central stake—truth as illusion—is repeatedly pressure-tested: each burn removes one more layer to “understand,” then escalates to the next portrait. No single external threat, yet Liora’s agency sharpens a single axis: destruction is the only access to creation, cost explicit when she cannot risk recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory against erasure—is signaled early and tightens once: the Archives’ threat to flood the tunnels forces Elias’s final stance. Escalation is driven by his agency (hiding artifacts, standing in the tunnel mouth) under Accumulative pressure. Cost is visible on the page as the water rises past his knees. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can remnants of a broken choir still create meaning without volume? Pressure tightens as each sensory subtraction (lost voices, dulled inlay) raises the cost of trying again. The final hum is an act of agency that forecloses “loud” forever, accepting fragility. No escalation missteps; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to exploit or share the fruit—tightens once when Elias slices it and chooses nourishment. Cost is felt: loss of professional identity and social standing. Agency drives the turn; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restore wonder—tightens when Elias chooses to plant the Last Wonder despite fear of failure. Escalation is one decisive beat: seed into node → hive reboot → city gasps. Cost is visible: engineers will disbelieve, but the child’s grin proves the trade-off. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—poison the sea’s child—escalates through three cascading revelations that reweight knowledge; the tightening occurs when the human threads the seam, foreclosing escape and paying with their last breath of surface air.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of missed opportunity—tightens when the door appears and Lena refuses it, paying the price of perpetual motion. One meaningful deepening: realization the climb is choice, not prison. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: prove kindness lingers. Pressure tightens once—leaf vanishes, brush wears, dawn must be re-inscribed—forcing a stance crystallization (continue writing). No external antagonist; the conflict is between exhaustion and hope, resolved by renunciation of sleep. Cost is visible: the painter forfeits rest and the original leaf.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—save displaced arts—narrows as each loaf initials raises cost: baker’s dough shrinks, Liora’s hands bleed carving stone-velvet 'K'. One decisive tightening: breaking lens redefines tactics from nostalgia to active enactment. Visible price—museum defied, beekeeper’s secret re-anchored—forecloses passive remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—stepping beyond fate—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened by each backward spin. The single decisive turn is Elias’s step onto the stone, which forecloses return; cost is the world’s temporal rupture and his own erasure. Pressure grows via the yoyo’s increasing radiance and the stones’ deepening carvings. No coincidence resolves; the tide only seals the irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim a face that photographs refuse to hold—is signaled in the second paragraph. Escalation is one deepening: each mirrored corridor intensifies the pattern until Lysander must unbosom the thing wearing his face. The tightening is driven by his agency (lunging through, not at) and costs him the last ember of his stolen life-frames. Coincidence is absent; pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—turn the storm into rhythm—signaled early and tightened through each percussive beat. Escalation is accumulative: each sound thickens the sky’s response until the sea itself sings, narrowing Leeward’s options to collaboration or destruction. No external reversals needed; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Cost is the orchard’s survival and Leeward’s relinquished mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what happened to the expedition and what the watchers want—tightens when the shell answers back. One clear escalation: the watchers move from horizon to city edge. Agency is Elyas’s; coincidence never resolves. The price (loss of whistle, irreversible opening) is legible, though the watchers’ offer remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—truth versus institutional protection—tightens once when Elias photographs the page, foreclosing secrecy. Escalation is causal: each action narrows options until the final renunciation. Cost is visible in the forfeited Codex and the looming police arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving meaning from abandonment—tightens when Elias answers the stranger’s note and seals his own reply; the cost is the inkwell’s forfeiture. One meaningful deepening suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus curated silence—tightens when Elias realizes the blackout is deliberate. One decisive turn: discovering his own future mapped in the book, which forces the choice to leave the chamber intact. Cost is felt in the closing line: “Some stillness wasn’t meant to be shared.” Pressure escalates under causal logic; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering the daughter’s voice—tightens when the gem bites and the maker must choose absorption over mere recording. One decisive intensification suffices; the cost is visible in her physical dissolution and the cranes’ luminous flight. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is the unmade past’s price; one deepening beat (console frequency tweak) escalates through causality, narrowing options. Emotional disequilibrium at closure shows cost crystallized under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus solitude—tightens when Lena’s drone theft forecloses solitary decoding and forces shared witness. Escalation is one deepening: from solitary pursuit to mutual recognition. Cost is the loss of exclusive knowledge. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only reveals, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—atonement versus continued erasure—is signaled early and tightens when the note forces a live choice. Pressure escalates through pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals; the final beat narrows options to confrontation or perpetual flight. Cost is felt in the hurling of the watch hand and the trembling paper, though the escalation is more atmospheric than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—free the boy—signaled early and tightened once: Kaelis’s refusal forces Elias to reframe the trade. Escalation is causal, not coincidental; each offer narrows options. The cache for nephew swap carries a visible price for both sides. No reversals beyond the single decisive tightening, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—alignment of inner compass with lived responsibility—tightens via the pole-counting ritual; the final refusal to paddle out crystallizes the cost. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Liam will reclaim or relinquish his past—is signaled early and tightens through the lake’s ultimatum. The baseball throw is a decisive, irreversible act that forecloses return; the chess pawn move extends the cost into social terrain. Pressure is coherent and escalates under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—should she breach death’s law—is signaled in the fortune-cookie epigraph and escalates via two conjuring attempts; each inflicts hotter, then colder, contact burn. Second conjuring forces a conceptual repricing: her own shape becomes the currency of grief. Cost is legible, but only one full beat of turn.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost time—tightens when the ink-ledger reveals each crack as a stolen year; the pressure deepens under Accumulative/Textural logic, and the cost (shattered saucer, acorn in palm) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—open the locked dimension or remain the last—intensifies with each failed stitch. Agency is relentless: every snapped thread raises the cost of the next attempt. One decisive tightening when the tear resists forces Lien to risk total erasure. Price paid: 300 years, the ship, her own gravitational anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—trading light for inner wholeness—is signaled early and tightened when the prophecy appears wet on the wall. Escalation is textural: each vial released heightens the stakes until the last bug becomes a comet. Cost is felt in the ash reflection and the irrevocable emptying of her only “wealth.”

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—break the fort’s grip—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is causal: each lock picked forecloses retreat; the flare of the signal parchment marks the irreversible turn. Cost is visible—the fort’s arsenal will be “ash” and Kael forfeits his post. One tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep the promise or be unmade—tightens once when the dust burns and the eels coil; agency is renunciation/acceptance of eternal guardianship. Cost is legible in her bleeding palms and the dawn’s impossible colors.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—release vs. preserve the censored poem—is signaled early and tightened once: the storm’s intrusion forces the decisive act. Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency under Accumulative pressure; the cost (loss of the physical text) is visible. No coincidence resolves the conflict. The tightening is singular but sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate because each coded attack forecloses diplomatic options; the cost is legible in the sung metal sparks and the partner handshake that accepts unwritten treaty stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will flee or stay to nurture the library’s resistance—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: the violet’s arrival tightens the emotional cost of departure. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (Maren’s arrival) complicates but does not resolve. The final renunciation carries a visible price—the lie and the surrendered name—under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: will Lena breach the sealed past and reclaim her lover? Pressure escalates via the ticking horizon and the single-use film path; each beat narrows options until the door is the only exit. Cost is the burned-out bulb and the irrevocable passage of years. Agency is hers alone; coincidence complicates (compass alignment) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve collective memory—tightens when Manik forgets his daughter, forcing Liora’s irreversible trade. One meaningful escalation: seed ingestion narrows options to total surrender. Cost is visible in her altered gaze and the ridge’s tremor.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to carry an unspoken apology—tightens when the compass’s lace pattern offers a method. The single deepening beat: the needle bleeding color forces Elias to choose between keeping the relic or letting it root. The cost is the loss of the compass and the irreversible tint of the leaves. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's ritualistic observation under accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in "flood had taken... illusion of control." Dominant stake (performative growth vs patient witnessing) signaled immediately with "He wasn't here to mourn."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation through ledger discovery deepens the dominant stake (purpose after trauma), but brother's handwriting reveal relies on coincidence rather than earned causality; cost ("ash in lungs") is visceral yet the twist weakens agency.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (translating silence) signaled early; deepening through tactile realization ("case was a cipher") narrows options under Accumulative lens. Visible cost (bleeding fingers) alters tactics as she plays harder, reweighting silence’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: his decision to swim despite currents (“not with violence but with insistence”) narrows options, while the lens’s vibration reweights the dominant stake (rest as signal). Cost is unmistakable—fragments’ physical toll and the lens’s crumble foreclose his path, charging the final image where “the ledger’s pages held firm” only through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    One dominant stake (survival through anonymity) tightens when patrols torch the arbor, forcing Elias’s 12-rings escalation. Cost is visceral in "kindness was now a crime" and the smoldering dawn scene; agency lies in his refusal to hide, making the wind’s eventual ringing inevitable under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: kneeling for the jade deepens conflict from searching to confronting truth, narrowing options to a single breath. Cost legible when the jade’s disappearance reweights his purpose ("keeper now"), though secondary stake (plague memory) slightly dilutes focus.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative density: fading photos → disintegration → retrocognitive entrapment. Agency crystallizes in sideways run and fragment-throwing, with visceral cost (burning palm, rough grain). Tightens to single trade-off: survive texture vs. be trapped in "when".

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven purely by Lena's agency: arrow notch sequence ("impede, then proceed") narrows options to reverse key order. Guard confrontation forces tactical shift with immediate cost (empty pockets, fading shouts).

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen through Elias’s agency (feeding flames, placing imprints), but the rising tide’s escalation feels more environmental coincidence than pressure directly tied to his choices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Liora's agency (memorizing blooms to exploit the wilting peony), but the stationmaster's passive dissolution during the climax undercuts pressure—his warning of imminent doom resolves via coincidence rather than her tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: Thaw pressure intensifies through Elara's discovery of the second bookmark ("controlled collapse"), forcing the valve decision. Cost is unmistakable—"satchel heavy with tools she wouldn't need" shows forfeiture of past identity as she follows an "unrecognized" path.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten causally through shell/cast/ledger sequence; "bleeding onto shell" trade-off embodies cost, though Jacob's absence weakens antagonist pressure slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Timeframe (one star fading) tightens pressure into meaningful deepening; protagonist agency in retelling silences directly creates the erasure insight; conceptual cost of dissolving self is unmistakable in "no longer a man but another layer of quiet".

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate purely through protagonist's agency (playing violin → triggering memory cascade), narrowing options from existential questioning to embodied remembering. Cost is visceral—reality dissolution—with no convenience; coincidence only complicates ("whisper from violin").

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes deepen through Lena's agency: drawing the ticket forecloses her old habit of cryptic doodles. Cost is visceral in her emotional shift ("didn't need to translate"), narrowing options toward earned transparency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' agency: lever adjustment narrows options from "violate protocols" to "step through time." Conceptual cost (K-11's transition) alters tactics instantly. Accumulative escalation peaks with lab→shore reconfiguration under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (deciphering ghost's code) tightens through Elias' agency: wading to balcony, playing silence. Cost legible in physical reactions, but escalation lacks one visible trade-off (e.g., risk of injury in flooded space) for 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: Liora’s shift from static uncertainty ("slow unraveling") to visceral certainty ("storm breaks *now*") narrows options to silence or warning. Cost is the station’s destruction and her life, made legible in "it would take the station with it" and vanishing footprints under aurora’s glow.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: turning the valve narrows options to endurance. Cost is conceptual (truth as burden), but lacks tangible price paid *on page* beyond the wheel’s weight shift. Dominant stake (inherited trauma) deepens via Luz’s thread-swallowed throat, though physical cost remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure tightens through the library's groaning collapse and river's rise, narrowing options to pure witness; the keeper's endurance forecloses identity with felt cost in "edges blurring" and "breath shallow" under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (collecting stories to mend displacement) tightens when the tapestry’s axis moves, forcing Elias to accept the world’s tilt. Agency drives escalation: his decision to "feed diaries into the fireplace’s maw" triggers the displacement. Cost is visceral ("hook behind ribs") and conceptual ("last human dream had been dreamt").

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Chen's agency: transferring film via daughter escalates pressure under Accumulative lens; cost legible in abandoned lighthouse ("silence another kind of warning") though micro-tension could deepen daughter's hesitation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (understanding vs. banishing) signaled immediately; pressure intensifies through indigo's spread and tightening silence loop. Priest's agency drives every escalation beat with visible cost (becoming the assumption he illuminated).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes remain abstract until the ice groans; "homesickness as a when" lacks concrete pressure until closure. One meaningful deepening (silence as waiting) works but needs earlier tangible consequence of his unspoken music to elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes crystallize early ("conquest of the self that kept splitting") with escalation driven by Elias’s agency—the merger collision narrows options to one timeline, paid via tablet’s destruction and permanent loss of runes as conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate via Elias’s agency: broken needle to palm-on-horn choice, narrowing options to tactile music; cost crystallizes in carrying the needle as "reminder silence isn’t empty."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when curiosity compels reading the message, foreclosing safety; cost legible in "wasn’t sure he wanted to be found." Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens reweights "integrity in solitude" with visceral dread.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (unraveling grief’s nature) tightens via conceptual deepening: tears as sustenance, not sorrow. Elias’s agency drives escalation (uncorking vial, walking away), with cost visible in abandoned livelihood. UV mechanics narrow options early, making the payoff inevitable under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: rope unwinding layers ("knot tied by desperate hands") tightens escape/surrender binary until "resonance" snap. Cost is visceral (burned hands) and conceptual ("shape of the question"), but "texture of time" motivation needs earlier concrete friction to reach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via accumulative lens: the dominant stake (whether beauty requires completion) tightens through Liora’s agency in shifting from her father’s melody to co-creating with the girl. Cost is unmistakable in "the chronic hush learned to sing"—a conceptual reweighting that forecloses isolation with felt pressure, avoiding coincidence or static conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.7)
    Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: the chemist’s half-truth ("ache without loss") forces her to choose counterfeit or truth, with cost crystallized in his shattered self-image. Escalation via petal’s transformation ("no more half-truths—just the raw, electric sting") reweights longing’s meaning under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (correcting "mix-ups") tightens through Elias’s agency: scribbling reply, pressing locket into her palm. Medical supplies plan narrows options, but cost feels implied rather than viscerally paid on-page during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Reed’s agency: her solo search deepens the dominant stake (belonging as action), with felt cost in her relinquishment of chasing Syl, crystallizing under the Accumulative lens via the village’s handprints.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful—boy’s "borrowing time" tightens stakes into visceral trade-offs (giant waking, towers unbuilding)—with cost legible in the city’s gasp and dissolving leash; agency-driven deepening elevates tension without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through textural escalation (prism expansion, mist thickening) that reweights the dominant conflict—mapping grief—under accumulative pressure. Cost is visceral (hollow chest, dissolved lichen), though escalation leans slightly passive as the orchard acts upon him rather than through his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: caching (endurance) shifts to exposing himself (renunciation of safety). The outage’s erratic flickering narrows options, but the transition from observation to action lacks sufficient escalation—his "reckless" move feels sudden without clearer internal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency—her decision to pull stakes reconfigures the nursery’s future under Accumulative pressure, with cost legible in abandoned scientific ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate texturally: the brooch exchange narrows options to acceptance ("he didn’t ask what it meant"), with cost legible in Elias’s surrender to the island’s demand. Agency drives every beat—following rain, pressing brooch—under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single deepening ("pearl pulsed... suddenly she understood") sufficiently narrows Liora’s options under Accumulative lens, shifting her from seeker to vessel. Cost legibility stumbles slightly—the "baker kneading dough" vision lacks tangible forfeiture—but final stance crystallization ("hands empty, heart full") compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten when Elias realizes the city needs "someone to stitch gaps," foreclosing his initial goal of herald restoration; the cost is visible in his shifted tactics ("heartened," not recorded).

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (confronting grief as precision detour) tightens through vault progression. Agency-driven deepening: Elias's "dare to believe" redefines options, culminating in whispered truth. Cost legible in dissolving punch and altered tactics (following new fractures). Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence (sister's arrival) complicates but doesn't resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: her transcription choices narrow options from "scoffed at magic" to "carve the whole sky," culminating in the tile’s glow enabling the brother’s appearance. Cost is legible in "the memory stayed, woven into the tower’s bones" after the tile dims.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (release vs. eternity) tighten through magnetic pull "unmaking harm," but the cost of "unmaking harm" feels abstract until the copper vein’s return crystallizes conceptual sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (twelve lives) tightens relentlessly through Lira’s agency; each erased name narrows options with escalating cost. “Twelve for *her*” revelation crystallizes moral calculus without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate via hum's progression (vibration→name→life) but pressure lacks meaningful tightening—no active opposition or trade-off beyond passive reception. Cost ("weight of Elara’s forgotten afternoons") is felt but doesn’t alter tactics beyond emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via dissolving journal and "ephemeral compass" pressure, narrowing Elias’s options to harmonizing vs. solving. Cost is visceral—the vanishing ink forces irreversible renunciation, crystallizing his stance under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through deepening: mural evolves from warning to "foundation," with the drifting raft as felt cost. Agency remains Elira’s reorganization tactic, narrowing options toward the clocktower act.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (preserving pristine crater) tightens via the three chemical pulses, but drone threat remains offstage coincidence; time pressure alone lacks active opposition to deepen the cost sufficiently for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (flawed navigation risking maiden voyage) tightens through Elias’s diagnosis-to-repair sequence. Cost is visceral: his isolation amid cheering crowd and the "dozen broken things" waiting, narrowing options to quiet endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen through Lena’s agency (deciphering patterns), narrowing options to stepping onto the ice, but the cost remains atmospheric ("relief") without tangible forfeiture; escalation lacks a visible price altering tactics earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency: archway's groan forces "quickened pace," while warming cobblestones narrow options by raising collapse urgency. Cost is visceral in "legs ached" and the fragile "for now" of the archway's survival.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens succeeds in deepening the hush’s pressure ("pressing against her marrow"), but the oxygen countdown lacks causal traction—time pressure fades before climax, weakening the tangible cost of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven by Elias’s agency—plucking the name narrows options to rewriting truth—with unmistakable cost (the burning name, societal disbelief). Stakes (“change the beginning”) viscerally materialize through the lattice’s unfolding, avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes signaled immediately: "debt older than orchard." Escalation via Accumulative lens—each cameo appearance costs Liora essence, deepening to final dissolution. Agency clear in "unspooling essence into bead's hunger"; cost undeniable in veil unraveling. Keeper's "drain it dry" shows tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten when labyrinth shifts via Elias’s touch—agency-driven under Accumulative lens. Cost legible in "bones aching" and irreversible wharf transformation. "Drowning man" simile slightly dilutes cost proof but final image reweights stakes decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (restoring faith vs. blight) escalates through Elias's agency: purposeful wandering narrows options to planting the seed, with visible cost (sundial cracking) reweighting "faith rebuilt" as labor, not miracle, under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Lena's manual code tweak for "Mizuho," narrowing options to analog transmission; the felt cost—irreversible mailing and erased chalk—reweights her marginal existence under Accumulative pressure without overt antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes (truth vs. censorship) tighten through Elias’s agency: synchronizing telescope/flame escalates pressure under Accumulative lens; cost crystallizes when enforcers arrive early, foreclosing escape with physical immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes tighten through deepening: spirits’ question forces agency shift from hesitation to release. Cost crystallized in "wounds didn’t need to heal to stop hurting" as conceptual price for closure. Accumulative escalation reweights "river between us" from metaphor to lived reality.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake (translating trauma) tightens through Lena's agency: coral handling evolves from self-grounding to gifting, narrowing options as she walks toward "other broken things." Cost legible in "knuckles white" and physical sacrifice ("ribs singing").

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes ("rediscover lost joy") materialize viscerally through scent/laughter; pressure tightens via communal projection reweighting grief. Cost unmistakable in "film would fade... knowledge network carries memory," though emotional toll remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through Liora’s agency: pressing the nickel narrows options to "threshold" realization; painting the door forces trade-off (certainty for curiosity). Cost is unmistakable—"breath hitched" at the blank mural, then physical departure with "garden swallowed her whole," reweighting options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes ("thoughts taxable") escalate via planted messages, narrowing options when Susans signal "they know." But external threat remains abstract—drones scan but never confront. Visible price (uprooted gardens) lacks felt cost on Elias; conceptual cost insufficient for 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (dissolving war through art) deepens via ghost confrontation, but his easy unraveling into "kelp and bioluminescent dust" slightly dilutes cost legibility. "Tasting salt and metallic tang" grounds escalation in visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten via emissaries' approaching torches; cost legible in "inkwell shattered" but dominant stake slightly abstract despite visceral countdown.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single stake (control vs. harmony) tightens via Liora’s deepening realization, not external pressure. Cost is palpable in elders’ mortar-set faces and the conceptual price of "letting water through." Accumulative escalation reweights options through blueprint’s emotional texture.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake (trust/silence) tightens through Elias's agency: sending the pigeon with music. Cost is felt in his rusty hum and ink-smudged ledgers. One meaningful deepening suffices, though "paper trails" concept doesn't actively shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by Elias’s agency (grain analysis → sinkhole run); cost unmistakable in physical/emotional shift at candlelight ("wanted to scream... but air was different").

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Elara’s agency drives escalation: her question to Kael ("You ever see this topside?") redefines stakes, narrowing options to shared vulnerability. The respite’s peak forces a trade-off (connection vs isolation), with cost legible in her choice to stay—driven by Accumulative pressure, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preserving fading memories) tightens via the cave's "breathing" urgency and sprouting seed. Cost legibility peaks when blood revelation forces integration of "thousand half-remembered lives," though time pressure lacks granular escalation before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by sensory density accumulation (laughter → shadow → tide spray) narrows Lior’s tactical window. Cost legibility weakened as conceptual price ("order hiding") remains abstract despite brilliant fire-eater/torch synchronization.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: observing gaps becomes ritual prerequisite, dust's hunger narrows options to blood-ink sacrifice. Cost unmistakable in transformed skin and "sea would rise without her" resignation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten as dawn breaks: mist thickens, wind turns, first boat arrives—forcing Elias from ritual to work. Cost is visceral in "the harbor would forget what it had almost remembered," reweighting transience under Accumulative pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake ("how to hand pain without cutting") tightens through Elias's agency: ex-wife's call → reinterpretation of cracks → drawing with charred stick. Cost crystallizes in relinquishing the box, foreclosing his isolation path with tangible weight shift ("steps were lighter").

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via gauge’s needle moving "sideways" deepens the dominant stake (hope as dynamic exchange) with felt cost in "the decorations dissolved into the water, meaningless," though agency leans slightly passive as patterns "revitalized" without visible struggle against the rising tide.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.1)
    Legacy burden tightens relentlessly: echoes swell, negative burns in pocket, door groans open. Agency peaks when match lights the varnish—foreclosing mystery path with visible cost in trembling hands and completed mural.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through deepening: heartbeat payment tightens pressure as it unravels, narrowing Liora's agency to walking away. Visible cost (soldier's aching ribs) alters tactics, though physical consequence for Liora could be more embodied during peak ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (legacy erasure vs preservation) deepens through egg placement with felt cost; thunder’s false promise escalates pressure under Accumulative lens but lacks one visible tactical shift beyond the central act.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through thread-untangling: laughter/sorrow/vein pulses narrow options toward sanctuary entry; cost crystallizes when threads snap sealing her inside, but conformity's threat remains abstractly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (ethical storytelling) tightens through Elias' internal deepening ("space between the told and the teller"), with cost legible in abandoned precision. Pressure grows accumulatively, but miner's outburst lacks tangible consequence beyond reflection, limiting escalation impact under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stake (honoring transience vs. valley's false permanence) tightens via spiral's unraveling—a single deepening under Accumulative lens.

Pressure grows through the wing's disintegration; cost unmistakable in "knot undone" as tactics shift to noticing silence.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (preserving vs. releasing memory) tighten through Elira’s reconfiguration act, with felt cost in dissolving regrets. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via sensory density, but the "forgiveness" motivation lacks sufficient friction against her goal during the ritual’s escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    Accumulative escalation via terminal messages ("INTERPRET THE DREAMER" deepening to "TO KNOW... CEASE ASKING") narrows options; storm's thrumming pressure makes cost legible in "bones" before ash seal.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Qishti’s agency: decoding evolves from curiosity to covenant-sealing, narrowing options until the passage forces faith over science. Cost is visceral in the final image—his threadbare robe unchanged, but the stars now "burn just a little brighter" with intimate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (stewardship vs. exploitation) tightens through Veyra's active rejection of predecessors' paths; cost legible in "do neither," but orchard visions lack distinct pressure escalation between choices.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully through swatch application and ledger tearing, but "narrative threads" mechanism remains underdramatized; cost legible via sinking ship yet sister's seamless return slightly softens the earned trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: reweaving braids escalates pressure until the door’s hum deepens, narrowing options to merge or document. Cost crystallizes in the vanished ledger—archival identity sacrificed for lived absence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Eldrin's agency under Accumulative lens—methodical ice-reading deepens pressure until the bloom's invitation. Cost unmistakable: fissure splitting ground and stone darkening foreclose resistance path. Single deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: retrocognition's cost (loneliness) and prism's hush narrow options toward the beacon's meaning. Agency in rekindling feels earned, though collapse timeframe's pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (sculpting identity from memory) tightens through Accumulative pressure: shadow’s "twitch" and colder memory deepen knowledge. Cost is visceral in abandoning conjecture for listening. Agency is pure internal shift—no external antagonist needed for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (grief's texture) tightens through chronicler's observation of ripple fade, narrowing options to silent transmission. Cost felt in "cloth worn thin" image. Escalation slightly passive—relies on insight rather than agency-driven pressure shift under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by child’s agency—each gravity inversion deepens the "freedom vs safety" stake through tangible choices, with bunker collapse delivering undeniable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via accumulating sensory pressure: vial’s darkening, refracted laughter, and recalibrated weight narrow options toward Elias’ philosophy. Cost is legible in passenger’s "better distributed" burden but lacks deeper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes ("break cycle of power") remain abstract until throne shatters; no personal cost shown during descent. Sunrise deadline creates real pressure but conceptual cost lacks visceral immediacy at peak moment. One tightening (below vs. upward) sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes viscerally felt through Lior's suffocation metaphor made literal in "charcoal dust coating lungs." Single escalation (shadow's encroachment → threshold reconfiguration) narrows options under Accumulative lens with agency in ring-turning.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via protagonist agency excels—the bolt twist narrows options to "break the loop or become it"—but the conceptual cost (redefined pressure/diamond relationship) leans slightly abstract in the final image. Visible price (bleeding palm) ties to stakes, yet the thematic weight ("space between what you owed... wide enough to breathe") risks overstatement without fuller physical anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes (identity as "dynasty ender") tighten through Elias' agency—striking then tuning the handle—culminating in felt cost: his entire self-concept dissolving into "the first to cross." Pressure grows via density, not events, under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by knight's agency—thread-tightening pressure forces the unsnap choice, narrowing options from silence to speech with felt cost (holy fire pain) that reconfigures the dominant stake: allegiance to possibility's shape.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming lost histories) tightens through Elias’s agency: his research transforms the button from artifact to "stubborn insistence on connection." Cost is legible when he imagines Daniel "whispering to a ghost"—a felt vulnerability that alters his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.6)
    Escalation driven by Lena's agency: puddle navigation → key turn → arson, narrowing options to "rewrite the revisions." Cost is legible in "her name just another whisper" as conceptual erasure forecloses legacy, reweighting stakes under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via density increase (mist thickening, panes weeping rainbows) under Accumulative lens, but the "hushed will wake" consequence lacks visceral immediacy. Cost is legible in audience's unnerved silence yet remains emotionally distant.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens: leaf runes and monument activations tighten pressure through Liora’s agency (building the seed tower), culminating in her irreversible transformation with visible cost (bark-dappled skin) that forecloses her human identity.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes crystallize when "pattern, not coincidence" shifts agency from fixing to unmaking. Visible cost in abandoning clock-winding, but escalation relies on situational pressure (waterfall's questions) over protagonist-driven tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten when the coin "answers" the crucible, raising cost to "reduce her to ash"; Liora's agency in redeeming the experiment under Accumulative pressure makes the weight's transformation feel earned and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: her realization (“You want to be laughed *with*”) drives the pivotal petal-scattering choice. Cost is legible in the gorge’s physical reconfiguration, though escalation feels slightly compressed—the laughter integration occurs rapidly without intermediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stake tightening when basin vision forces realization that "mercy was in the asking"; protagonist agency drives every escalation under Accumulative lens with undeniable cost in "mind a ledger of absences".

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen through Lior’s agency (decoding painting/log), but the "overlooked histories" motivation lacks sufficient friction until the climax; pressure tightens via sensory accumulation rather than explicit trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes crystallize through Elias’s agency—dust analysis drives the discovery, the barrel turn forces the irreversible choice. Cost is unmistakable in the pendulum’s shatter and ghosts fading, though the "weightless burden" concept could tighten its grip earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through Elias's agency: unstoppering the bottle despite warnings tightens options, and the visible cost of library dissolution ("glass walls running like wax") reweights reality's negotiability with undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when Taelis interrupts: "tampering with dead culture" vs "letting it speak" forces Elias's decisive act. Shard fracture narrows options to one pressure point, with visible cost in the dust and archaeologists' altered perspective under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (truth vs. decay) tighten through sensory density ("air thick with unsung notes"), but Elias’s agency falters at climax—the stone "took" his honesty rather than him actively choosing sacrifice. Cost is unmistakable ("thieves choking on truth"), yet the pressure lacks one visceral trade-off where his repairman instincts directly conflict with reclamation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency under the Accumulative lens: his psychometric touch intensifies pressure ("rock answered in fragments"), narrowing options until the arch's hum forces a stance crystallization. The cost—burning his father's notes while accepting "the shape of absence"—is unmistakable in the yard scene, reweighting the dominant stake (solving vs. preserving mystery) through irreversible action.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via deepening understanding (slide's layers → archway as loom) forecloses survival-focused path for connection. Cost visible in sacrificed GPS/driftwood and altered tactics (carving hand). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens but minor early stake ambiguity prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (understanding the flowers) tightens through Liora’s agency: her postcard-to-glass experiment triggers the deepening ("glass shivered... from something inside it"). Pressure accumulates via sensory narrowing (winter light → perpetual twilight) until the realization reweights options—"She didn’t paint it." Cost is legible in her renunciation of active searching, though escalation feels subtle rather than unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (truth preservation vs. destruction) tightens via debris arrangement, narrowing options to parley. Cost legible in diary dissolution, but Revision Board threat resolves too easily—their retreat lacks sufficient escalation pressure despite scarred officer's hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation—laughter/footsteps raise "will it vanish?" cost. Escalation driven purely by alchemist's concentration (agency), not coincidence. Cost unmistakable: bottle lightens as memory becomes tangible, altering tactics toward sustaining the town.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Elias' agency: prophecy forces shift from archiving to sketching his own fear. Cost legible in trembling hands and burial ritual. Escalation via density increase (Akkadian voice → "hinge" intimacy) under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single dominant stake—saving seeds from vortex inheritance—escalates through Liora's agency: her "remembering" triggers cap's softening, whispering the method invites vortex's howl. Cost crystallizes when roots thread into chick's bones, altering tactics via irreversible transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elias’s agency: the aftertone’s warping forces the rope reweaving under time pressure ("minutes before zero hour"). Cost is unmistakable in the physical toll ("pulse quickened") and implied sacrifice of normalcy, narrowing options to one precise solution.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes crystallize early: Eli’s belief in stillness’s meaning versus others’ dismissal. Escalation driven by agency—tracing the star’s path, whispering "I see you"—tightens under Accumulative lens via meteor shower’s density. Cost unmistakable: station’s transformation forecloses isolation, with "porous" vulnerability altering his tactics (leaving as witness). One decisive deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by beekeeper's agency (exhale triggering the seam's shiver) narrows options to one decisive choice, with cost unmistakable in the empty box's weightlessness—a perfect tightening under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) escalates through Elias's agency: decoding embedded messages narrows options to "unraveling" time.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake (beauty in brokenness) tightens when kite string snaps—forcing action that crystallizes his stance. Agency drives escalation: retrieving kite leads to "temporary connection" realization, with cost legible in "poem felt alive—not because it was finished."

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake ("Where do you belong?") tightens through Elara’s agency: her whispered answer unlocks the hologram, her touch triggers the tower’s tremor. Cost legible in "sculptures rearranged" and irreversible departure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: "distance is a wound" evolves from abstract riddle to physical cost (melted wax, scar/promise dichotomy). Pressure coheres via environmental clues (wind bending rocks), but fissure discovery lacks causal agency—coincidence complicates, doesn't escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Lira’s agency: the anomaly’s temporal expansion forces her to reinterpret "Home" as direction, not place. Cost is legible in the final image—she trades survival for transcendence, shown by the compass needle’s new orientation and the station’s "empty but no longer abandoned" state.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation builds through Accumulative density: whispers rising to "chorus of recognition," penumbra recoiling from "spaces between stories." Cost is clear in the splintering board, but the interregnum timeframe remains atmospheric rather than a tactical clock tightening decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens is masterful: glyphs shifting → map of hollows → realization language is "seeded" tightens the buried-talent stake into irreversible action. Cost is unmistakable in the mountain’s groan and Elias’s storm-churning eyes during the seed act.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through the tutor’s agency (decoding threads) rather than coincidence; the cost—absorbing regret into platinum—is felt in "rhythm of a heart learning to beat without shame," though the thunder motif’s escalation lacks visceral trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (truth vs ritualized absolution) tightens when chant falters after her whisper, narrowing options to carving or silence. Cost is unmistakable: spire shatters, elders' screams vanish into mist. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens; the "refract" action reconfigures meaning with visceral consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate via Accumulative lens through sensory density ("acid sea hissed closer") and cadence shifts, but statue's response leans slightly on coincidence rather than pure protagonist agency at the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: wrong turn → shell revelation → jump. Cost legible in burned paintings and villagers’ misunderstanding; "temporary eternity" reweights time’s value under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: scent-beckoning narrows options to a single, precise note, with cost legible in the "clean, bright ache of dawn" and fishermen’s altered behavior. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens, foreclosing brute-force methods via earned sensory trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes crystallize through Lena’s agency: translating "gulls turn black" riddles into "the way back" reweights her grief as navigable terrain.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation through accumulation of sensory gaps (lavender nets, gouged piling) deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens, but lacks a decisive narrowing of options; cost is legible in the relinquishment of memory yet escalation feels observational rather than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes crystallize perfectly around one choice: ink-stained maps vs. child's sob. Creek's rise escalates pressure causally. Slight deduction: ants' guidance feels convenient rather than earned complication.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation driven by queen's agency ("burned it without reply") tightens to irreversible trade-off; cost ("pain was exquisite") unmistakable and reweights dominance of "soul for truth" stake.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate via Elias’s agency: "revalued the shell" shifts from extraction to offering, narrowing options to jump. Cost ("landing was not") legible in closure. Single deepening suffices; pressure coheres under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (deciphering meaning) tightens when Elias connects screw to "pressure and yield," crystallizing his stance with cost: accepting sensory loss as "map."

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten texturally as the storm’s "second breath" gathers, narrowing options to act before rain falls. Lian’s agency—shedding the quill tip, whispering the rune’s true name—drives deepening under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in "scars rewove into thread of light." The feather’s drop reweights pressure, making the final readiness ("to write its name upon the wind") feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency: pouring the drop forces Elias’s choice ("step in or not"), narrowing options to irreversible reconnection. Cost is visceral—Elias’s cough, the splitting apple—and the orchard’s destruction lands as conceptual price, fulfilling Accumulative escalation’s demand for reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (unraveling cosmic illusions) tighten through dictionary's shifting definitions, narrowing options until tearing it becomes the only agency; cost is legible in "hinge between what was and what will never be" with conceptual price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’ counting agency; black water/burnt copper escalate cost visibly. Ship’s vanishing charges final image but conceptual price slightly abstract for peak band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (failure of imagination in monitoring systems) tightens through Lena's active observation and red pulse choice. Cost is unmistakable in chest ache lifting, though secondary pressure from Elias could deepen escalation beyond his single line of dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: choosing blue then refusing choice. Cost legible in "palms stinging" and heart monitor contrast. Single meaningful deepening (contradictions as seams) reweights probability with visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether the woman can "loop back"—tightens through Elias’s deepening revelations (disconnected number caller, dead mother).

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes crystallize through proximate causes: tracing the locket photo forecloses passive mourning, with cost felt in "bitterness became part of her." Agency tightens options via single meaningful turn (inking vellum), though moral calculus lacks competing goods. Lens-perfect escalation for length.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes deepen through Lena's methodical usefulness (radio fix, rheumatism diagnosis) narrowing options until Carter's ledger reveal reframes the "cure." Her agency in passing the rock carries conceptual cost: the realization that connection requires surrender, not possession. Accumulative escalation perfectly calibrated for length.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's sensory accumulation narrows options via celestial window ("only chance"), with cost legible in grief's transformation—not resolution—though constellations' mechanics slightly abstract the temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (editing vs. layering history) tightens via anomaly's transmission forcing stance crystallization. Cost legible in wasted years correcting past; escalation driven by Elias's agency interpreting signals under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes tighten when "shadow moved where no boat should be," forcing Liora’s lunge and Elias’ signing storm. Escalation driven by protagonist agency (camera as shield, net of silence) with visible cost in trembling hands and the camera’s transformed weight under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when vandalized portrait reweights from rage to map; Elias's agency drives escalation ("he understood: the archive wasn’t a tomb"); cost legible in ledger burning but secondary accent ("volcanic tenderness") slightly dilutes dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake escalation (theft → release) driven entirely by Lira's agency under Accumulative lens; cost legible in lagoon's "froth[ing] with abandoned sorrow". Minor lack of secondary stake depth prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven entirely by Lior’s agency under Accumulative lens: storm-scrambled maps force him to navigate via whispers, narrowing options to endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (boy's need for absolution vs. shame) tightens through guardian's light-weaving, narrowing options to silent witness. Cost is visceral: crumpled note left behind alters tactics (boy walks lighter). Slight deduction as escalation relies more on environment than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: window displays foreclose passive resistance, forcing council confrontation. Cost is visceral—the hammer’s strike makes "teeth ache," altering tactics (workers lower tools). One meaningful deepening suffices, but "hush" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes crystallize around carrying grief: Lena’s scream narrows options from stillness to shared action, with cost visible in her cracked face. Pressure escalates via Accumulative lens through accumulating silence (empty chair, dust) until the scream reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (boundaries vs transformation) tightens through hum's escalation and ice fracturing. Protagonist agency drives deepening ("ban had never been about keeping them out"), but external pressure from hesitant figures remains underutilized.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (fear of silence vs. desire for connection) tightens through Elias' plant-messages and concertina playing. Escalation peaks when Liora deciphers "awaken" from basil—proving communication possible—before the final note reweights silence as "beginning" with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens as hum evolves into voice, but external pressure (researchers' skepticism) lacks sufficient escalation to narrow options; conceptual cost earned yet slightly abstract during lens disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative pressure tightens through Lena’s agency: folding twelve cranes transforms passive grief into active "leaving," narrowing options from solitary relic-making to communal teaching. The cost—"hollow and waiting"—is felt in relinquishing control as cranes fly away, altering her tactics toward generative release.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (mapping belief-system collapse) tightens when the quant reveals her brother was the guru—a visceral cost transforming abstract analysis. Escalation lacks one tangible trade-off (e.g., Elias risking something to hand over the tape).

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens is masterful: each star-tracing step intensifies the unwritten calendar’s unraveling while narrowing Liora’s emotional options, with the cost ("whispers gone") unmistakably legible in the quiet after liberation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when Hollow resets clock—agency-driven narrowing from "reset too many times" to carrying sparks, with felt cost in "tracks ahead were new"; escalation flawless under Accumulative lens via dune luminosity shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake ("unravel the hum") is signaled early but remains abstract; no tangible cost or trade-off emerges. Pressure doesn’t escalate—wind-listening method unfolds without complication, and the "wild frontier" vision arrives via passive translocation, not earned agency. The felt cost (leaving the gear) occurs post-revelation, disconnected from active struggle. Stakes never viscerally threaten or constrain choices.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (courage for staying vs. going) tightens through Liora’s agency: her question to the silver-braided woman forces crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (safety vs truth) tighten through Elias's agency: following discoloration, confronting pianist, choosing to stay. Cost legible in "pain returning in flickers," but the pianist's sudden appearance lacks causal groundwork, softening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through Veythas’ micro-choices (tracing ink, whispering Lirien’s name), narrowing options via Accumulative pressure, but the pretender’s unearned appearance weakens causal escalation; his relief feels coincidental rather than a direct consequence of the scepter’s sundering.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate through Lena’s ritualistic assembly, narrowing options to a single path with felt cost (ignored protocols, dissolving atlas), but the "fossil fuel ban" timeframe lacks tactical pressure, slightly diluting the dominant stake’s urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens: Lena’s desperation for the stones to "mean something" tightens when their hum surges, narrowing options to either surrender or reignite. Cost crystallizes in the scout’s "hungry" face—a visceral reconfiguration of the lull’s abstract stakes into embodied hunger.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single deepening ("Rebirth" naming) sufficiently narrows options under causal lens. Cost undeniable (Council's heresy charge, physical sprout), but Reconstruction timeframe doesn't actively tighten decisions beyond initial context.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate through Lena’s agency: tourist encounter forces redefinition of grief as "roots," culminating in palpable cost when she imagines a future where weight isn’t grief. Single tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara's "redesign" action forecloses escape path, trading control for truth. Cost is visceral in "let the library’s hunger guide her," though "necessary dark" motivation could deepen earlier beyond whispered questions.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.6)
    Accumulative escalation via sensory density ("thrum of roots," "fissure didn’t spread") narrows options to endurance; cost legible in isolation as world burns outside the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.4)
    Single dominant stake (bury vs publish truth) escalates through Lydia’s agency: ledger discovery tightens options, plates arrival forces intervention. Cost is visceral—stomach twist, "weight of what she carried"—culminating in tea clink as earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes ("hush dissonance" vs. "pay with witness") tighten through firmware’s betrayal; escalation via protagonist agency (feeding paper) creates irreversible cost (amber crack), but secondary guilt ("cry not yours") lacks visceral testing.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through sensory density (humming tiles, burning flake) under the accumulative lens, narrowing options to "interject or collapse." Cost is undeniable (dissolved flake, shifted mural), though the "unlearning" backdrop lacks tighter causal pressure on Lior’s tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by Lydia's agency under Accumulative lens: intertwining branches to produce visions reweights Elias's stake with felt cost in "pocketed the pills." Pressure tightens through sensory density, not causal turns, perfectly aligning with lens.

    Dominant stake (voice for the world vs. stasis ban) tightens through Lior's agency: deeper cave entry, palm-press on fossil, and decisive speech. Cost is visceral—the fossil's disappearance—though escalation relies slightly on environmental response over character adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by Elias’ agency: cataloging buttons deepens knowledge, well descent tightens options, button discovery transforms prophecy from warning to choice.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (re-engaging vs. endurance) tightens through pillbox opening—Lena's agency narrows options from avoidance to commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (crossing at precise moment) tightens through fog’s patterned lifts and gutter rhythm. Cost legible when gutters fall silent mid-crossing, forcing irreversible action. Agency lies in coachman’s "now" decision under Accumulative pressure, though merchant’s impatience lacks sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (understanding resistance) tightens via the bee’s thrum deepening into "a string plucked in a room he couldn’t see," forcing his choice to embed the glass. Cost—emotional labor of remembrance—is legible in "resistance was remembrance," though chimney smoke’s role feels slightly under-tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether beauty persists after trauma—tightens through wilting basil and nicked thumb, escalating to Elias’s arrival shifting the “quivering hush” from warning to invitation. Lena’s agency in whispering “Grow toward the light” forecloses despair with visible cost (last rose petal fallen), though harbor’s pressure stays atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes crystallize through Lior’s agency: his whispered question ("How do you coexist...?") escalates into the book-grabbing climax. The cost—dissolving book, feather sacrifice—is unmistakable, but the stone circle’s hum lacks active constraint beyond atmospheric pressure, slightly muting escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes (keeping vs. releasing secrets) tighten through Liora’s agency: observing the thrush spiral’s placement leads to her own act. Cost is visceral in the thread metaphor’s culmination. Escalation under Accumulative lens is flawless, though the monk’s guidance slightly softens the pressure’s organic rise.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: spatial mutiny forces his key-driven choice with felt cost ("lungs tightened"). Pressure escalates via environmental shifts (tilting floor, coiling roots), but the organ’s role as complication lacks causal development beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation ("mist coiled tighter"), but Elias’s agency in deepening the vision feels slightly passive; cost is legible in his breath sharpening from "the weight of it".

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes crystallize through Elias’s sprint against Liora’s warnings: redeeming Orin’s name versus survival. The nail’s warmth compelling action despite alarms creates relentless causal escalation, with the burned journal’s ashes embodying the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single escalation beat (glass visions → road) suffices for length. Agency-driven deepening when Elias plays "road’s name" narrows options; cost legible in "bridge had nothing to do with it."

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (cyclical vs spiral paths) deepens through cage-bar discovery, narrowing options to acceptance; cost legible in released cigarette. Agency drives deepening under Accumulative lens without causal turns.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (uncovering hidden truth) tightens through Eldrin’s agency (seed planting), narrowing options to unbearable knowledge; cost legible in "weight pressing him flatter" with perfect band-guardrail execution for length.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (uneclipsing covenant) tightens via sensory accumulation, but cost legibility falters—future self's "covenant not ready" undercuts tension. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven tradeoffs; resolution hinges on revelation, not earned choice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency (stitching ashes into bark), narrowing options to a single trade with visible cost (the wilting flower), though Veyra’s late appearance slightly softens the pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through agency: recognizing "After" scrap forces Liam to confront value beyond appraisal, crystallized in "I’ll take it." Cost is visible—relinquishing certainty for "space between notes." One meaningful deepening suffices, but secondary stake (quarry job?) underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's climb (agency narrowing options to "reestablishing"), with cost legible in his realization that this isn't undoing but holding "both at once" like translucent text.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten when the key demands melting "the hour between midnight and dawn," forcing Elias’s crucible choice with felt cost (aching ribs), though moon-phase pressure remains atmospheric rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single dominant stake (weapon vs. method) tightens through shell confessions that progressively foreclose alternatives. Escalation driven by protagonist's agency—each buried shell deepens understanding until the crown choice—culminating in visible cost: the pearl's dissolution woven into the world.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation via graffiti density ("third bridge" revelation) forces stance crystallization; the cost of turning right (abandoning maps) is visceral in the "cracked earth" and "ivy parted" reconfiguration under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by her agency: tearing the page accelerates the library’s collapse, narrowing options to a single sprint; cost is unmistakable in the dissolving shelves and watch unraveling her own silences mid-escape.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes crystallize through agency: coffee stains' 'mulberry ache' third option forces shattering as the only path to propagation, narrowing choices to empire's cage or wild growth. Cost is unmistakable in the visceral thorns and social erasure ('she would let them'), reweighting 'destiny perforated' under Accumulative/Textural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (delivering the dead woman's message) tightens when Liora infuses the chip, narrowing options to a single choice: reach through. Cost is visceral—the chip's light spent, the grotto's altered hum proving irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (grief’s relationship to rebirth) tightens through Maren’s agency: "I want the source" declaration forecloses peace-seeking. Escalation via Accumulative lens—pressure grows as moss pulses, vines curl, until shoot dissolves "like wine into water." Cost crystallized in violet-sky realization: grief now "feeds the roots of what came next."

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (certainty vs. uncertainty) tightens through Elias' agency: unhooking cloak knots narrows options via tangible cost (threads dissolving).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake "how to vanish" deepens via pond ripples with visible cost (body snapping back to 62); Elias' agency in stone-dropping drives escalation under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to memory-based teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes crystallize through the lagging bird's anomaly, tightening options to stillness as the only survival tactic. Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (calling the pulse home) with unmistakable cost—the erosion of self into stone—reconfiguring "navigate without moving" from observation to sacrificial embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Marlin’s agency under the Accumulative lens: the keystone’s touch forces stance crystallization ("The sacred in the simple"), with conceptual cost legible in his rejection of the deans’ validation, though the automated hymn’s role in deepening pressure could resonate more acutely.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via static sharpening → resolved question → harmonic vibration narrows options to dissolution; dominant stake (aligning with purpose) tightens through Liora’s agency in arranging coins; cost crystallized in the rebirth’s conceptual weight ("coins smooth now, unmarked by time").

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven purely by reaper’s agency: crystallizing fears narrows options from abstract dreads to named hungers. Cost is unmistakable in "He already did" regarding regret, which forecloses emotional capacity. Single deepening (fears finding monsters) perfectly suffices for length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (cosmic imbalance) tightens through Elias’s agency: uneven drips signal worsening crisis, driving his bell-striking escalation. Pressure grows via Accumulative lens—dripping rates transform from observation to "language" he must speak—with visible cost in physical toll ("fingers bled") and the enduring imbalance. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation driven by Elias’s agency: nailing blank photos (failed expungement) to burning new ones (active release). Dominant stake ("past wouldn’t be erased") tightens through the photograph trail’s deepening meaning. Cost is unmistakable—"ashes swirling into hands... reaching to lift"—reconfiguring memory from weight to current with visceral finality.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Kael’s agency under Causal lens: custody hearing tightens options to merge or be dissolved.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (safeguarding space for innovation) tightens through the seed's physical escalation, narrowing Elias's options from solitary curator to communal steward. Cost is unmistakable in "business slowed... stopped" and the lawyers' arrival with "something that burned," though the astronomers' role feels underdeveloped for their thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Elias's agency (pulling the cord "harder than usual"), narrowing options from fabricated to authentic laughter with visible cost: his obsolete method becomes "mournfully eager no longer." The dominant stake (grief's expression) tightens through this single decisive intensification under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes crystallize through Lyssa's agency: her shift from waiting to laughter drives the unraveling; cost is visceral (world dissolution) and unmistakable in "words lifting from her bones" under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten decisively when the crozier shudders at doubt-feeding, narrowing options to "let it be worse"; the guild’s visceral flight crystallizes the conceptual cost under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake ("find beginning in every ending") tightens via Elara’s agency: discarding assumptions narrows options to surrender, paid in shattered dish and internalized hum. Cost legibility falters slightly—the emotional toll of mentor’s legacy remains implied rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.6)
    Escalation driven entirely by Lira’s agency: aligning the wheel against "unseen currents," then actively merging timelines despite "five minutes" pressure. Cost is visceral in the ferry’s shuddering and liquid silver water, reweighting the dominant stake (temporal navigation) through Accumulative deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency: "They’re coming to dismantle it" tightens pressure, forcing his admission "I’m proving they were never ours," which deepens knowledge and narrows options. Cost unmistakable in gallery's dissolution—visceral trade-off where "rational enchantment" resolves into mundane room yet connection persists, reweighting stakes under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes signaled early with Kael's "not meant to go there" cost, but escalation relies on Elira's monologue about spiral horizons rather than protagonist-driven deepening; agency shifts to alien knowledge, weakening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (finding her before mist takes her) tightens via glove discovery, narrowing options to touch/endure. Cost is legible in Elias’s physical collapse and new dual role, but mist’s agency slightly softens protagonist-driven escalation at peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (identity erasure) tightens through ink’s heartbeat sync, narrowing options to endurance. Lena’s agency in choosing to "defragment" drives escalation under accumulative lens. Conceptual cost is legible in the certificate’s lingering presence but "mattering less," though timeframe pressure feels implied rather than live-clocked.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate via Veyra's agency (ignoring tremors, pressing on), but "hunger" isn't sufficiently contrasted with fear to deepen the trade-off. Cost is unmistakable (death), yet the fatal choice lacks moral calculus between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten via arrowhead’s metamorphosis into seed, forcing Elias’ cosmic-joke choice. Cost is legible ("stay and rot or let the joke rewrite him"), but phone’s coincidental ring slightly undermines agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes deepen through violinist's agency: heartbeat signaling narrows options to one irreversible act. Cost crystallizes when statues "melt" into soil—conceptual price of rebirth is visible. Tightening occurs at "crack split the earth," but secondary stake (personal liberation) lacks sufficient friction against primary goal.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten credibly through Elias' agency (running to post office as drones close in), with scar and satchel weight as felt cost. But "haunted by letters" revelation feels coincidental rather than earned escalation under Accumulative lens, losing 0.3 for one escalation flaw that doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (silence as barrier vs. possibility) deepen through Lior’s agency: following song, shaping air. Cost legible in the vocal failure preceding the offering, but "wrong turn" escalation relies on accumulative pattern rather than causal pressure, slightly diluting escalation under Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: shifting from passive fragment-collecting to reading "spaces between" pages redefines options. Scarf dissolution provides undeniable conceptual cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative/Textural lens: failed photo (silver streaks) deepens into pulsing image, raising cost of the dream's dissolution. But pressure lacks meaningful tightening—adjusting aperture feels mechanical, not earned escalation under protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (freeing an idea vs. locksmith’s rule) tightens through her agency—pressing the thumb forecloses her rigid principle with visible cost. Man’s demand ("free her") lacks sufficient development to deepen secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s escalating memory gaps to the fairy ring’s hum, but "spaces held open" insight lacks visible tactical shift; cost is felt yet not leveraged for agency.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (fear of misreading exile) escalates through shadow’s lunge and Kael’s binding act. Cost of return remains slightly abstract, but "teach you how to return" and annotations’ glow reweight stakes under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder) tightens when seed "pulsed warm," narrowing options to theft. Agency-driven deepening: pruning knowledge directly enables solution. Cost visible in Elias's vanishing and "debt" framing under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens is driven by Elias's agency: his shift from accumulating silence to recognizing the net's lie narrows options to one irreversible choice. The cost—visible in the dissolving net and townsfolk's unlatched doors—is inseparable from the prism sanctuary's light, which transforms from "splintered rainbows" to "blood"-like pools, making the stakes viscerally felt through environmental reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake ("threshold of when") tightens through protagonist's agency (film overlay method); conceptual cost of abandoning Guild dogma legible in "quiet certainty" reconfiguring final image under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: her realization that "the cost of light was the shadow left behind" forecloses understanding as a path. Conceptual cost (burden of truth) is unmistakable in the sediment-like lie and dissolving keeper dream.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (will spire remain prison or become lens?) deepens via agency-driven escalation (diary interpretation); cost of years of misperception legible in "frozen steps." Tight for length with single decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through Elias's agency: snapping the string (choice) tightens pressure, culminating in surrender as renunciation. Cost is palpable in shedding identity ("not as a meteorologist... but as a thread"), though external pressure remains atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten texturally through the demolition deadline and the coin's fading pressure; agency drives the glass ceiling's creation with visible cost in the warped coin and "pillow damp with sap" after the collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through gear-by-gear agency: the second gear's resistance ("gummed with memories") narrows options, and the child's correction forces a trade-off (reinterpreting "light"). Cost is legible in the final image—"the quiet space between what was lost"—but the sister's physical absence slightly blurs the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation via Liora’s "reexamine the cracks" action narrows options from individual respite to collective burden, with cost legible in how "earth still hummed with old explosions." Pressure tightens through fruit’s sweetness and butterfly garden’s evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (duty vs compassion) is clear, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the girl’s arrival doesn’t narrow options—Liora’s action remains unchanged, muting trade-off cost.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (atonement for survivor's guilt) tighten through Elias's agency observing river patterns, but the cost of "dissolution" feels earned only in the final paragraph; escalation lacks visceral friction until the chrysalis release.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (where stories begin) tightens through Liora’s agency: her incising choice narrows options to embracing absence. Escalation via textural deepening—bottled moonlight’s flare reweights "quantifying absence" as visceral cost. Stakes feel urgent through sensory immediacy ("air smelled like first rain after drought"), avoiding abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elias’s agency (preparing/smothering memory) narrows options to ritual act under Accumulative lens; cost legible in "clean" taste and lifted weight, though pavilion’s passive resolution slightly softens protagonist-driven pressure at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation via Liora’s agency (stealing/rehabilitating weight, index cards) narrows options under Accumulative lens; Elias’s "spines bend or break" crystallizes the cost of endurance versus adaptation with visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes tighten through Lena’s agency: each mirror adjustment deepens entanglement until physical collapse ("knees hit the ground"), narrowing her choice to either flee or integrate the chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes crystallize through Lysara’s agency: reaching for the seed triggers collapse, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is legible in the "blank manuscript" and "smudged print," reconfiguring her path with visceral, felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes (can grief find voice in silence?) tighten through Elias’s tactile escalation—strumming cracks, pressing the insulator—until the cost manifests physically (numbed fingers, fevered insulator). Agency drives every beat; the grove’s reconfigured silence as "waiting" reweights options without coincidence, making the felt cost undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (deciphering the covenant’s silence) tightens when the girl asks "why you count spaces," forcing Elias to articulate his philosophy before making his dent-focused move. Cost is legible in his vulnerability: "Not of losing. Of playing at all."

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate through the live clock of approaching fireworks, narrowing Elias' options from recovery to action. Agency drives the tightening: his realization that empathy requires breaking silence forces the streetward choice with felt cost (lost workshop solitude). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stake (serenity within motion) tightens through Liora’s agency: planting accelerates Elders’ arrival, flower’s visions force confrontation. Cost is unmistakable—the exposed village secrets and unlocked vault alter future dynamics.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes viscerally felt through bodily cost (moss spreading, veins thrumming); escalation driven by Veyra’s agency (dive, seed retrieval). Inversion’s "hour ending" tightens tactics. Cost unmistakable in transformation, though secondary conflict depth limited by scope.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Veyra’s agency: flare use transforms knowledge (revealing leaning containers), forcing renunciation of "explanations." Cost is visceral—torn sleeve, changed worldview—under accumulative lens where pattern recognition reweights survival stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency ("struck the first chime—not to constrain, but to unfetter"), with visible cost in the sheet's destruction and elders' heresy charge; one tightening (silence→breath) suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency: playing to widen (not seal) the breach crystallizes the stake shift from "keeping out" to "following." Cost is unmistakable in "stopped fighting the tide" as the weave "breathed easy."

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stake tightening when press prints Elias’s unrecognized emotion narrows options to surrender. Agency-driven escalation (pressing palm to fragment) forces the cost—transposed hearts settling into bones—unmistakable in the final image’s weight.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten via courier’s agency when he rips the pendant, but woman’s appearance relies slightly on coincidence; cost remains unmistakable as mentor’s dissolution reshapes "passing on" as obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency: his commingling shifts from observation to terror when the prism "answers," narrowing options to destruction. Cost is unmistakable in the physical unknotted shoulders after hurling the prism.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through density: bead discovery → weaving → dissolution narrows options to silent sacrifice. Cost is palpable ("sender must stay"), but escalation lacks a decisive tightening beat under Accumulative lens; deepening alone caps near 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: feeding silk into the fissure narrows options (only one coil remains) with felt cost (magic spent).

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens: dominant stake (handling inherited sorrow) tightens through Elias’s realization about trees absorbing pain, narrowing options to "pass[ing] sorrow along." Cost is unmistakable in "hands... felt lighter," driven entirely by his agency with no coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes viscerally tighten via Liora’s escalating physical cost (burning throat, bleeding fingers) under Accumulative lens; the returned harmony reversal feels earned by her agency, not coincidence, with “it was her” crystallizing the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through Lena’s agency: Voss’s reflection forcing her to see "breadcrumbs" forecloses hiding, narrowing options to endurance or engagement. Cost is visceral—ending 12 years of seclusion—driven by her choice to descend and lock the door. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens via escalating paradox density ("mistake is not an ending, but a door").

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure (bread → wheat → communal weeping) under the textural lens, but the oven's sudden activation lacks visible cost during the baking beat, slightly diluting the "meaningful tightening" requirement for 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through vow dissolution ("time running out") but dominant conflict shifts abruptly from preservation to pursuit without showing Elias's internal trade-off; the cost of joining her feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=10.0)
    Lena’s agency drives escalation: her false starts ("feather on the scale") narrow Veyne’s options until the irreversible "shuddering note of a promise snapping."

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.7)
    Dominant stake ("unlock what [the lock] kept sealed inside him") escalates purely through Accumulative pressure: rust/grief jam → prismatic ghosts → painting’s pulse. Agency crystallizes in turning dial "to a memory," with visceral cost ("arms burned").

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.6)
    Escalation through accumulative density: map fragments → archive whispers → writing act narrows options to truth-telling; cost unmistakable when gilded craft is abandoned for bleeding ink.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single dominant stake (preservation through destruction) tightens under magnetic pressure. Elias’s agency in lighting the match narrows options to "flames don’t stop" vs. stagnation, with visible cost in abandoning the dome—a trade-off earned by the box’s pyre.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (can listening heal loss?) escalates through textural accumulation: mailbox clang → photograph → letter → courtyard replies. Cost legible in "weight of a voice she hadn't earned," but crowd's instant unity ("gasped as one") undermines earned pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: the dice roll triggers the lab’s response, narrowing options to dance-or-drown.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake tightening via gravity's physical cost (stone dissolution/ash flowers); "pockets of gravity yawning wide" deepens knowledge with visceral trade-off. Agency drives escalation.

    Escalation under accumulative lens: meteor showers and brick-tracing deepen the brownstone’s pressure until Elias’s blood-signing forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (memory preservation vs. systemic erasure) tightens through Liora’s agency: feeding the father-memory triggers the garden’s shudder, escalating to full archiving. Cost is unmistakable—freedom forfeited ("dragged away") but memories set free, proven when patrol hesitates at the lily’s light. Single deepening (memory-feeding) reweights options under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—unlinking decrees to forgive the unfinished—is signaled by the thorn's introduction and tightens when the Emperor appears, foreclosing escape. Agency drives escalation: the forger's press of the thorn narrows options to joint truth-writing, with visible cost in the Emperor's crumbling composure. Single deepening suffices masterfully.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen via shell’s three disclosures ("Kaelis," "third spiral," "hollow"), narrowing options until Veyra’s final renunciation. Cost is unmistakable: her voice removed from the universe’s song. Kaelis’ presence elevates stakes beyond internal conflict alone.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Lena’s agency—decoding the cameo appearances shifts widow’s focus from loss to survival. Cost is legible in the widow’s trembling hands and the locket’s "jagged edge," reweighting grief under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten when Liora’s whistle reveals the minnows’ response to "hidden patterns," transforming her abstract doubt into visceral cost (awareness of her own breath’s weight). Escalation driven by her agency under Accumulative lens; moon-path method shapes the pivotal attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten when the stillpoint’s "meaning" reveals the Liquidation was a quarantine—not a conspiracy but a cure. Cost crystallizes as Elias realizes his life’s work was "fertilizer," with the ground splitting open as irreversible consequence of his choice to "turn the key."

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (dawn as knife vs. scalpel) tightens via Elias' agency: sealing portico forecloses passive path. Cost crystallized in "silence worse than static" and risen city. Pressure accumulates through sensory density (static → wails → silence) per Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    Single dominant stake (contain artifact resonance) tightens through protagonist agency: ice thinning forces vibrational matching choice. Cost unmistakable in "unravel her from the inside out," altering final tactics ("bought time. That was enough").

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (patient vs. impatient revolution) tightens through viaduct's shiver; cost is Lior's irreversible departure. Sister's conflict remains off-page, weakening secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency: inserting heart into music box narrows options from reflection to irrevocable action. Cost is visceral—"sleeves soaked," ink bleeding—and legible in the post office beat, tightening the dominant stake of unearned absolution under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through Lena’s agency: discovering redirected files narrows options to override or comply, with system alarms and termination flag proving cost. "They unwrote us" deepens conflict meaningfully. Slight expositional dip in "EchoNet consumed it" momentarily stalls pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by Elias' agency under Accumulative lens: visions accumulate pressure until his stance crystallizes ("not as a peacekeeper... but as the one foolish enough"), with visible cost legible in the ice's proximity during his step.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate causally: ice split forces dog rescue, parasol discovery narrows options to cancel clinic; cost is legible when she accepts dried fish "like a reason to postpone," altering her death timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reconciling mismatch) tightens via letter discovery and sketching, narrowing options to acceptance. Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens, but cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten accumulatively: prophet’s "sigils of flame" burning nuance forces Lysan’s active consecration. Agency-driven escalation peaks when the parapet’s song "settled like a second heartbeat," with chest-weight cost unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (transmuting pain) tightens when the butterfly lands on the fence, forcing the archivist’s decisive framing. Cost is legible in the town carrying the factory’s whistle "in its ribs," though escalation leans slightly passive as she waits for light rather than actively alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (decoding silence) tightens through Elias's escalating experiments, narrowing options to collaboration. Cost is visceral: abandoning his isolated quest. Woman's arrival complicates but doesn't resolve; pressure coheres under accumulative lens though secondary character's role lacks tactical depth.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single stake (harnessing change) tightens through the clock hand’s spin, narrowing Elias’s options to collapse or restructure. Agency-driven escalation peaks when he syncs with the hand, though the cost ("packed his tools") feels subtly earned rather than unmistakably visceral per high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes crystallize around executing a "flawless goodbye," tightened by Lena's agency: playing *Morning Has Broken* despite Mrs. Calloway's protest, then releasing the shard. Cost is unmistakable—the scent of hope lingers only in her palms, sacrificed for the living.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: learning shadows "feed" (not vanish) transforms curiosity into survival stakes. One tightening (key turn) narrows options with felt cost ("thirteen years" latency, becoming potential shadow). Coincidence doesn’t resolve; her choice to enter the library crystallizes stance under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen when the child requests "how to keep it," narrowing Liora’s options to transmission or isolation. Pressure escalates through protagonist agency (sharing sea glass), but Elias’ backstory relies slightly on coincidence, muting cost legibility despite the girl’s visceral reaction.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stake (healing public shame through quiet growth) tightens when Javier arrives, forcing Lena to share her refuge. Cost is visible in her pendant sacrifice and admission of unflinching bravery, driven by her agency in initiating the moss ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via cameo density surge ("fragments came faster") forces Elias' surrender—"I'm listening" narrows options to dissolution. Cost legible in physical vanishing. Slight convenience in cameo-to-ark transformations barely undercuts Accumulative pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Mira’s agency: trembling fingers to cracked note to burning throat, narrowing options until song becomes sole remedy. Cost is visceral—"chest tight with weight"—and alters her stance irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist’s agency: "hurry was the enemy of keeping" deepens the dominant conflict, with visible cost in her curved spine and blood-seal. "World ending" abstraction slightly dilutes concrete pressure, but escalation under Accumulative lens remains impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake (preserving fleeting memories) escalates through wounded season's deadline and daughter's impatience. Cost is unmistakable in the warbled echo's imperfection, narrowing options to imperfect preservation rather than perfect recall.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes deepen when grotto itself presses weight ("heavier than others, older"), narrowing Elira's options from release to absorption. Cost legible in trembling hands and the hush becoming her cradle, not trap.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through widow's agency when she keeps the carving, reweighting "contain" with visible cost; escalation driven by crystallized time deepening, though one pivotal turn suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation via ghost confrontation narrows Lira’s options to surrender, driven by her agency ("raised the camera wheel like a shield"). The chorus of "You left me behind" imposes visceral cost that forecloses avoidance, tightening under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (belief in escape vs abandonment) signaled early via "fleeting attraction" hope. Pressure deepens through Lena’s mapping of "terminal’s new rhythm," narrowing options to repurposing. Cost legible in town’s lost belief. Deduction: carnival’s pressure could be slightly more active beyond scent/memory.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (making peace with abandoned dream) tighten through his physical interaction with the forecourt, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the crack "split beneath his fingers" rather than arising from a clear choice, weakening pressure buildup to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes crystallize through deepening ("lies were scaffolding"), not escalation; Liora’s agency in dropping the ledger forecloses her quest with visible cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Elias’s shift from decoding to active preservation, narrowing options to splicing the seed pod. Cost legible in trembling hands and "weight of revelation," but escalation lacks tangible opposition beyond internal doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' agency—following thread to locket—and deepen knowledge ("he left because the sea promised answers"); cost is legible in his transformed understanding, though escalation lacks one visceral pressure point beyond sensory accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (beauty’s rebirth in mechanized world) tightens when the egg "unfolds" into flawed genesis; cost is visceral—the palace groans, wings scrape stalactites—driven by Aldric’s agency (piercing membrane) under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (proving compassion heals) tightens when boy’s blood stains thread—a visible price altering tactics (using coin as anchor).

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (liberating memories) tightens through Liora’s agency: hesitation at "They’re not yours to take" forecloses safety, paid with the box’s death and her flight. Escalation via Accumulative lens—thread-snapping to city’s awakening—reweights cost unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes deepen through the carver’s agency: re-tracing Liora’s name triggers the crack, then hollowing the stone actively transforms grief; the cost is legible in his daughter’s trembling hands and the "wound" becoming "a door" under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation: each knot’s unraveling narrows options (breath→scent→voices→vision), forcing Elias’s stance crystallization. Cost—bearing violent truth—is felt when the husband’s push vision dissolves, altering his approach to the widow’s knock. Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (future rejecting boldness) tightens when wind howls and ice groans, narrowing options to endurance. Cost is visceral in Liora's "fear she had overstepped," but the timeframe ("before pen meets page") isn't leveraged as active pressure beyond thematic setup, missing full escalation potential.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through Elias’s agency (inviting Lira in), tightening the dominant conflict—cultural survival—into a single resonant act; cost is palpable in his disappearance, though the Ministry’s off-page role weakens causal escalation slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes ("mirage of safety") tighten through Liora’s ritualized dissolution, but external pressure (curator’s critique) remains observational; cost is conceptual yet legible in "understanding was the enemy of art" crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (preserving choir’s essence amid hatred’s erosion) tightens through arrival of members; Elias’s agency in reframing “presence over loudness” narrows options with felt cost, though timeframe vagueness slightly dulls escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (creating beauty from failure) tightens through fruit’s growth, but city opposition remains declared ("critics called gimmick") without on-page test during peak action. Cost legible in "patience" requirement and ruined past.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.2)
    One dominant stake—preserving wonder in mechanized routine—tightens through Elias’s agency: planting the seed starves the city of certainty, blooming wild wonder. Cost is unmistakable in the engineers’ dismissal versus the baker’s paused kneading, reweighting options under the Accumulative lens without causal shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is subtle but coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens: the shard’s activation narrows options to acceptance (streetlights flicker, door clicks). Cost is legible in her altered perception ("air tasted different"), though agency leans passive as the bay acts upon her. One tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.6)
    Revelations tighten stakes by foreclosing options (ampoule slip → helmet removal) under Accumulative lens; human's agency in pressing seam forces trade-off with visceral cost (ragged breaths/knees on sand); pressure coheres without causal shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Lena's realization that the climb itself was the missed opportunity, narrowing options to one irreversible choice: enter the café or embrace flawed motion. The cost is tactile and legible in her palm warming the door while walking away, though escalation from creaking step to revelation feels slightly compressed for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen via Accumulative pressure—child's laughter crystallizes his hope into action—but the cost (worn brush, vanished leaf) feels conceptual rather than visceral. Agency is passive acceptance of the fig tree's gift, limiting escalation's emotional weight despite coherent lens alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Liora’s agency: the lens’ oven test transforms passive observation into active intervention. Cost is visible in the lens’ destruction and the baker’s gasp, but the beekeeper’s "absorption" revelation occurs off-page, slightly muddying escalation’s causal thread under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.6)
    Dominant stake (stepping beyond fate) signaled by "unmake it" and tightened through ritual sequence. Agency in "One pull" forecloses shore-bound existence; cost crystallized in "the sea forgot his name." Escalation driven by Elias’ choices under Accumulative lens, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (filmstrip retrieval forcing dissolution) with felt cost (enduring whispering advisor), but "tricking fear" motivation lacks one tangible middle-beat sacrifice scaling to climax.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency (striking different objects) deepens the dominant stake (turning obstacles into instruments); sea's voice forces crystallization of stance, but the cost—while felt—isn't viscerally physical enough for 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (truth about watchers) tightens through Elyas' agency when he plays the whistle, triggering the pivotal resonance; cost legibility suffers as the city's "trembling" feels abstract versus personal sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake (truth vs protected faith) escalates through Elias’s agency: police threat → "parallels" evidence reveal forces Callahan’s stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable in Callahan’s slack face and implied institutional unraveling, narrowing options decisively under causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (preserving hidden histories) tightens through Elias's deepening connection to the Keeper, narrowing options to commitment with felt cost (lost marriage). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens; the carp/shadow moment intensifies pressure without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten causally when cross-referencing coordinates forces a single path to the chamber, narrowing options under blackout urgency ("surface teams would restore power soon"). Elias’s agency—testing the hypothesis, entering the chamber—drives escalation, with visible cost in his worldview shift. The conceptual price (truth as burden, not prize) lands unmistakably in "he never told them. Some stillness wasn’t meant to be shared."

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes crystallize early: preserving her daughter’s voice versus surrendering to the dream-recording. Escalation is driven by her agency—pressing the gem, reaching into the pane—with visceral cost (pain "rewriting" her skin). The "unfolding" revelation deepens stakes under the accumulative lens, though the shadow’s origin lacks subtle foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten when Lena selects the operator's choice moment over wedding/survival, narrowing options to one thread. Agency drives escalation: her refusal of warnings ("warnings were for people who believed in consequences") forces the cost—observatory collapse—felt in the sudden dark and indifferent storm.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes crystallize through Elias’s agency: hurling the watch hand (a renunciation) triggers the note’s discovery, narrowing options to confronting Harkin. Cost is unmistakable in the trembling paper, though the note’s arrival edges toward coincidence complicating rather than resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten decisively when Kaelis reveals "they won’t release the boy," narrowing options to Elias’s trade proposal. Agency drives escalation under the Situational lens—his "adjust terms" line forces Kaelis’s choice, with cost legible in her hesitation and the boy’s "shivering" raw wrists. No coincidence resolves; the moon phase subtly intensifies temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (empathy as gift vs. burden) tightens through Liam’s agency: throwing the ball forces the lake’s path to emerge. Cost is legible in the newspaper burning against his thigh and the tunnel’s collapse "like a held breath released"—a visceral trade-off for his new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: first failed vision (saffron breath), then costly brother-echo with "cold that pulls you under." Dominant stake (reforging bond) tightens via spice mechanics, but phoenix timeframe lacks live-clock pressure beyond atmospheric role.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten when ink reveals time as "ledger" of thefts, forcing Liora’s agency in "repenting for time"; cost crystallizes in saucer’s shatter and her physical release, narrowing options to only walking down—a decisive deepening under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (opening the dimension) tightens through Lien’s agency: each stitch attempt narrows options, with escalating cost (unraveling body). The tear’s resistance creates earned pressure, culminating in irreversible trade-off during "push."

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency when she interprets mirror reflection as prophecy and runs toward lava; cost crystallizes in physical transformation ("roughened her, polished her") under Accumulative lens where density increase reweights "texture of transformation" stake.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—opening the armory before light returns—tightens causally as Kael navigates gearwork ("one wrong twist, alarms would scream"). Cost is unmistakable: the fort’s "grip on the valley broken," paid through dissolving gunpowder. Agency drives escalation without multiple reversals, per scope.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via density increase (aurora fracturing into needle-lines) is driven by Liora's agency; cost is unmistakable in "dust burning through her skin" and the final image's irreversible burden, though the "something older" antagonist lacks concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (releasing the poem) tightens through storm’s pressure; timer chiming forces decisive action. Cost is unmistakable in "dust of old poems" as weight lifts—not through speech but surrender to weather.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (Council’s verdict) tightens via pattern-decoding escalation. Elias tracing light refraction—not attacking—narrows options, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is visceral: abandoning institutional validation for partnership, charged by "Lock’s been broken for decades."

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes crystallize through Lena's agency—threading the reel, playing toward the path. Cost is visceral (compasses pointing inward), though the refuge's emergence relies slightly on environmental convenience rather than pure choice.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Monsoon deadline creates live clock tightening tactics; cost ("her own mind") is visible in physical transformation. Agency-driven escalation (cataloging dreams → biting seed) forecloses safety with stakes crystallizing when Manik forgets his daughter’s name.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: compass’s color shift forces realization that "unsaid" apologies must be diffused, narrowing options to planting it, with cost crystallized in the brother’s slammed-door argument now reconfigured as mended net-humming.
