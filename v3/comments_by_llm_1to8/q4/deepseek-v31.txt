  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation reads as density increase through accumulated dust discoveries that progressively narrow Aris's emotional options. The cost is legible when she acknowledges being "schooled by motes of dust" - her professional identity as mapper of "celestial beasts" yields to humble acceptance of microscopic teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds naturally from survival to discovery to purpose, with each revelation tightening options—the ledger demands investigation, the relay requires a dangerous climb, the message forces moral action. The final stakes shift from personal survival to ecological salvation shows clear cost: Lyra must abandon her safe anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation from failed attempt (indigo/crimson chaos) through recalibration (golden patterns) to breakthrough (frost transformation), with each stage narrowing Elara's options toward synthesis. The dominant stake—translating silence into music—tightens when frustration threatens abandonment. Cost is legible in the acceptance of trauma as part of creation, though agency could be stronger in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds from receiving the lens to understanding its purpose to completing the repair, with each beat narrowing Silas's options. The cost is visible as grandfather dissolves and Silas's "chased stillness" finally resolves. Could push harder on intermediate resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: scarcity → mysterious bounty → dangerous hope → revelation → decision to reshape narrative. The dominant stake (community survival vs. self-reliance) tightens when Kael discovers the truth, forcing him to choose between comfortable myth and harder truth. Cost is visible in Maever's sacrifice and the risk of shattering hope.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding unused love) intensifies through the camera's revelation and physical search. The breathing changes and vision create meaningful pressure. Cost is visible in Elara's emotional overwhelm, though the opposition could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from botanical restoration → discovering the fragment → understanding mother's fate → risking temporal unbending. The dominant stake (freeing mother and self from temporal loop) tightens when Elara realizes she must "unpick that stitch" with clear risk. The cost is legible: dissolving the memory loop that has defined her, with the photographs' disintegration marking permanent change.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from infiltration to confrontation to self-sacrifice. The sentry's arrival forces the ultimate choice between escape and mission. The chain becomes weapon then prison, showing clear cost: "the cold floor seeping through his trousers."

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear escalation from searching to discovering to the decisive choice to experience the traumatic memory "while cells divide." The cost is legible in Elara falling back and gaining "sorrowful, weathered peace" instead of vengeance. Stakes tighten when she realizes she must become the betrayer to understand. Could be stronger if the physical/emotional price were more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from infiltration to extraction to compromised escape, with the constable's arrival forcing immediate tactical shift. The dominant stake—stealing not just art but "the very feeling of the moment"—is unique and maintained throughout. Cost becomes tangible in the physical risk of the gantry leap and emotional weight of guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through the ice's groaning/shattering and Elara's glass-blowing rhythm toward her choice to abandon the bookmark. The cost is legible—leaving behind her collective's token to create new safe zones. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from betrayal discovery through coordinate decryption to the climactic dive, with Leo's phobia serving as the perfect guard for the director's evidence. The tightening from refuge to ocean confrontation forecloses Leo's option to remain passive, with visible cost in his terror and physical response to submersion.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through textural intensification: "ambered hush" deepens to "marbled hush," the booklet deteriorates, work "intensified" until the flake's fall completes the map. The cost—losing her purpose after achieving it—is clear, though the middle lacks a distinct tightening moment that would elevate the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating timeline variations - shattered violin, cracked plinth, harmonies - each testing Unit 734's perception until finding "the confluence." The cost manifests in "willingly allowing its own fractured existence to amalgamate," trading multiplicity for understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve damaging truth or choose mercy—emerges clearly through the lens discovery and escalates via the revealed fraud. The conflict tightens when Anya recognizes the manager's possible confession through donation. However, the opposition feels somewhat abstract; the retired manager never appears on-page, limiting the felt pressure of the moral choice.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from private ritual to defending life's work when Cederic threatens closure. The confrontation forces Elara to articulate her philosophy under pressure, with genuine cost visible in her "fragile" heart clenching. The resolution shows meaningful agency through her demonstration rather than mere argument, though the antagonist's quick concession slightly reduces earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate causally from past echo to future possibility to the critical "potential now" where boundaries thin dangerously. Vesh's intervention ("Wait") creates the decisive turn where scientific discovery overrides safety, with clear cost when the creature's acknowledgment forces him to confront an impossible truth. The tightening from demonstration to dangerous contact forecloses Vesh's skeptical worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate from salvage to discovery to sacred duty, with the building's structural integrity as the visible cost. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes the composition's true purpose—"not meant to be played, but to be felt." However, the ghost's presence feels somewhat convenient, and the lack of genuine opposition or risk to Elara herself limits the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate beautifully from personal recovery to paradigm-shifting discovery. The dominant stake - understanding whether his observation was real - tightens through concrete investigation steps. The cost manifests in "terrifying freedom" and the weight of knowing "the world below was unprepared." One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge, perfectly suited to this length.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds effectively from hum → voices → visible ghosts → radio breakthrough → revelation. The stake (uncovering suppressed truth) intensifies through spectral pressure. Cost is clear but resolution comes somewhat easily once valve is turned—more resistance would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal peace to existential threat to the library's ecosystem. The pressure tightens effectively through descent into increasingly hostile space, though the actual healing moment could face more resistance to heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes (Leo's emotional healing) deepen through the eclipse's pressure and the vial's revelation. The "crack in the ordinary" creates genuine escalation. Cost is visible in Leo's tear and the months of silence that preceded this moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen effectively from personal collection to existential preservation, with the diary discoveries tightening pressure toward Alistair's transformation. Cost is visible in accepting his role as "faithful scribe" to a dead world, though middle escalation could sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - Lena's transformation from "debt and duty" - develops through Eli's orchestration and her response to the lighthouse signal. The escalation from fortune to signal to action works, though the middle lacks tension since Eli's plan unfolds without meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through layered rhetorical pressure as Ansel builds his "harmonic argument" against the entity. The possession deadline creates urgency, and the entity's recoil/shriek shows genuine resistance. The final paradox revelation ("an answer that rejects the question") provides meaningful deepening that forces resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal yearning through active memory-mapping to the symphony's crescendo, with exhaustion as ticking clock ("had to act before exhaustion hits"). The cost manifests physically as Elara collapses, having spent everything to transform her homesickness. One meaningful deepening through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from navigating physical paths to confronting core memories, with each generated segment forcing deeper psychological engagement. The final choice between eternal defiance and acceptance carries weight, though the middle section's memory parade could tighten to avoid repetitive emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness through connection—escalates from private teaching to public performance with clear cost in vulnerability. The pressure coheres through Leo's progression from "jagged tremor" to "glided" bow work. The final "wave of quiet approval" represents earned transformation, though the conflict could have one more intermediate complication.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from personal sanctuary disrupted to moral crisis to physical danger, with Elara's agency driving each turn through her decision to investigate, analyze, and act. The cost is legible in the final beat—she has traded safety for integrity. The dominant stake (integrity versus complicity) tightens effectively through the lateral thinking that reveals her unwitting participation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - understanding inexplicable tears - escalates from physical reaction to emotional revelation. The tightening occurs when the vial's light reveals not just any memory but the specific source of his grief response. Cost is legible in the transformation from protective burial to painful recovery of "perfect, unadulterated joy."

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    The impossible choice escalates from curiosity to ethical dilemma with clear cost: gain enlightenment but unleash chaos, or protect the world and remain ignorant. The "cruel playfulness" tightens options effectively, though the stakes of "potential chaos" remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from harbor silence to greenhouse entry to the bowl's placement to the sustained note that finally unbinds trapped sounds. The cost lands explicitly in "heartbreaking chorus of all that was finished and all that was unfinished," though agency reads more as discovery than decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure from clinical failure to the grotto's transformation, with the blotter petal becoming carrier for genuine complexity. The cost is legible in Elara's "quiet, aching loneliness"—her success revealing what she cannot access. One meaningful deepening that changes her understanding of emotion's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake - recognition of unacknowledged worth - is signaled early and tested through the locket delivery. Elias's agency drives the resolution through his detective work and decision to deliver. The emotional cost lands in Maeve's reaction and their mutual recognition. Limited escalation; the conflict resolves somewhat easily without significant resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal offering to communal mystery to collective identity reformation. The search creates genuine pressure that narrows options. Deduction for the somewhat convenient mapping of tags and the lack of meaningful opposition or cost during the middle search phase.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—saving the city's temporal harmony—is clear, and Elara's agency drives the resolution through her sacrifice. However, escalation feels compressed; the journey "across a giant's nap" tells rather than shows mounting pressure, and the final choice arrives without sufficient resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through deepening rather than reversal - from surface pattern-tracing to three-dimensional understanding to emotional acceptance. The glass eyes enable the key perceptual shift. Cost is clear: Elara must abandon her original mathematical mission.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through discovery layers—from searching for data conduits to finding the tape fragment to uncovering Finch's hidden cache. The time pressure ("lights flickered again...Time was short") creates genuine urgency, though the final resolution could use sharper cost articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from failed algorithms through environmental surrender to complete methodological abandonment. The storm's return creates natural pressure that forces Aris's choice. Cost is clear in abandoning control and three years of work. Missing the sharper tension that would push into higher bands—the transformation feels somewhat predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal creative drought to communal water crisis through the convergence discovery. The exchange mechanism provides clear cost structure. However, the woman's arrival feels convenient rather than earned, and her immediate understanding of the "trade" lacks sufficient pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking power through claiming the pearl to fighting the shadows - clear tightening under causal logic. The cave's violent reaction and shadow attack provide genuine pressure. Yet Elara's solution arrives through remembered teaching rather than earned discovery, reducing agency at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - revealing suppressed truth to heal collective trauma - is signaled early and escalates through Elara's staged approach. The conflict tightens when her "reactively visionary" insight transforms historical tragedy into political conspiracy, forcing the community to confront deliberate suppression rather than accident. The cost lands in the old woman's tears and the "solemn line" of acknowledgment, though the opposition (city fathers) remains off-page.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (finding the fortress) is clear from the start. Escalation builds through environmental guidance, tool discovery, and door selection. However, the "dare" doesn't generate sufficient resistance - Elara moves forward with minimal internal struggle despite the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from scientific curiosity to profound connection with whale consciousness. The escalation through increasingly rich memories works well. However, the lack of real opposition or complication once the magic begins limits tension - Elias faces no meaningful obstacles to his transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from passive observation to active exploitation as the storm creates opportunity, with Elara using the fragment as a magnetic lens to unravel the wall. The cost manifests in the fragment's destruction and entering unknown danger. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient alignment of storm timing with her readiness.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from waiting for father → reaching for forbidden object → discovering hidden compartment → confronting asylum truth. The dominant stake (finding "mathematics of a fair trade") tightens as each revelation narrows Elara's options for simple anger. Cost is legible in the "heavier, more complex grief" that replaces her certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through deepening concentration and intensifying visions, from "primal sun" to specific human stories to the trees' "quiet ambition." The dawn's approach creates natural pressure that forces completion. Cost manifests in physical toll and the ephemeral nature of her harvest—she can only collect during this liminal time.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: fragments → pattern recognition → confrontation with the shipping clerk who confirms the horror. The dominant stake—discovering texture of vanished things—deepens when individual losses reveal "systematized removal." Cost is visible when he must abandon pursuit after the clerk's warning, accepting his role as witness rather than revealer.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (decoding the Signal) escalates from investigation through physical interaction to full reception of alien consciousness. The cost is legible in Elara's tears and the burden of knowledge she must now carry. The deepening from scientific curiosity to existential responsibility provides meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from private rebellion (graffiti) to community awakening (net-mender's response) to potential systemic change. The shift from "wall to keep change out" to "channel to guide it" marks meaningful deepening, though physical cost remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from preserving silence through chemical timing to capturing the shot to witnessing the end. The "vibration through the soles" signals irreversible change approaching. Cost accumulates through "dissolution" of the sand grain paralleling the view's destruction, with Elara's choice to remain as witness carrying clear price.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly through the harbor's iron clang signaling imminent departure, forcing Elara to work under deadline pressure. The tension between the ship's need and the drone's damage creates genuine urgency that pays off when the repaired drone races to catch the vessel.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: daily futility, breath-map discovery, venturing onto dangerous ice ("cracking like gunshots"), to the revelation that reframes her entire quest. The cost manifests in her realization that finding the source means witnessing an ending—"not a heralder of rediscovery, but a witness." One meaningful deepening that transforms her understanding, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preventing Elysium's complete erasure—establishes early through the failing support spells. Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening as Elara's rhythmic work progresses from diagnostic probing to active reconstruction, with the manifestation of echoes marking a decisive intensification. Cost is visible in accepting memory over physical restoration and the persistent threat that charges every action.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through density increase: from empty signal to physical temple to guardian emergence, with oxygen alarm creating genuine deadline pressure. The stakes crystallize in the binary choice: fight and die, or override instinct and risk everything. Cost is legible when Elias chooses potential death over survival.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from physical entry to spectral confrontation to emotional revelation, with the lattice transforming from object sought to active tool. The Warden's appearance raises immediate mortal threat that Kaelen meets with unexpected truth rather than lies. Cost is visible in breaking generational patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—settling the life-debt while saving the dying orchard—is signaled early and tightens when Elara realizes "the debt was not for the life saved, but for the life unlived." The ghost's appearances escalate from ephemeral to solid, culminating in the costly exchange. Minor deduction for relatively low external pressure given the protagonist's existing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through Thea's deepening engagement with the labyrinth—from sewing air to tracing quartz veins to the final prayer at the basin. The transformation carries clear cost in abandoning old ways, though the conflict lacks active opposition beyond inertia.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal restoration to understanding interruption itself as creative force. The missing gnomon creates genuine obstacle that forces contemplation and observation. Cost is legible in Elara's shift from active excavation to patient witnessing, though the resolution comes through observation rather than harder choice.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving human meaning in a surveillance state—deepens through the client interaction and chalk ritual. The pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, with the impending erasure and dawn transition creating temporal urgency. The cost manifests in the ephemeral nature of the work and Kael's acceptance of ghosthood.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from general conspiracy awareness to specific tactical intervention, with clear tightening when Kaelen arrives desperate. The dominant stake—preventing the coup through indirect wisdom—drives meaningful choices. Elara's constraint of teaching through "adjacent possibilities" rather than direct revelation creates genuine tension with visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative intensification as the window messages manifest Elara's unwritten thoughts with increasing emotional weight. The cost becomes legible when she walks out "unburdened" yet accepting permanent separation, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through pattern recognition: chaos on cast → coral discovery → therapeutic application → surgical intervention. The stake intensifies from understanding a child's trauma to rewiring her own PTSD using that same pattern. Cost is visible in submitting to experimental brain surgery based on a child's drawing.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (rediscovering creative joy) established early and deepens through the fragment discovery that shifts Elara from creating new to resurrecting old. The frustration beat when "the anatomy of the long-dead tree eluded her" creates genuine pressure before the knowledge network provides resolution. Cost is visible in the acknowledgment that "the light would fade" even as joy is reclaimed.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through deepening discoveries: coin's resonance → hidden musical notations → central dome's pure note. Each revelation narrows Elara's path from restoration toward discovery. The cost (abandoning her restoration work) is implied but could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from general surveillance to specific threat to decisive action. The warning message creates genuine pressure that forces Elara's choice between scattering or acting. Cost is visible in the destruction of their communication system and the risk of capture.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal failure ("her words were dust") through the planet's "acute" pain to the cosmic revelation of the creatures' war. The lullaby discovery tightens pressure by clarifying Elara's true purpose. Cost is visible in the "centuries of longing" and the physical act of carving into shell walls.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through textural intensification: crack discovered→widening fracture→dulling petals→breathing mist→transforming to light. The cost is unmistakable when "silver light fading from her" shows physical depletion. One meaningful deepening that changes both tactics and knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from stalled translation to discovering the crack to understanding "interconnected promises" as emotional bonds. The dawn deadline ("timeframe charged with potential") creates genuine pressure. The revelation that changes "to sing" to "to witness" meaningfully reweights all prior understanding with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from political pressure through Kael's ultimatum to Isla's realization about structural instability. The tightening occurs when she must choose between compliance and finding a third way, with clear cost in defying the Council. Agency drives the resolution through her engineering insight.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulation: from static balance-seeking to discovering the music to releasing Argos despite exposure risk. The dominant stake—preserving lost songs versus maintaining safety—crystallizes when she must choose between hoarding the discovery or sending it out. Cost is legible in her breaking months of isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from navigating shifting corridors to reading wood grain to stepping into traumatic memory. The sacred threshold concept deepens from architectural to temporal, with clear cost in crossing. Stakes cohere around understanding rather than action, appropriate for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: silence becomes "absolute," instruments fail, despair closes in, leading to the risky sensor bypass that enables discovery. The dominant stake (finding meaning/belonging in isolation) tightens when she shifts from studying unreachable stars to reading the water itself. Cost is legible in years of isolation and the urgency of sharing her discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulating frustration with gaps, leading to the walk that enables discovery. The seed's arrival deepens rather than reverses, revealing the "landslide of forgetting" as an active burial with clear cost—entire emotional pathways permanently lost.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through precise mechanical tension—water dropping, lever clicking, bishop's arc—with stakes crystallizing when the family enters. The dominant stake (creating genuine wonder vs. mere spectacle) tightens as Silas must trust his calculations. Cost is visible in his choice to remain anonymous, forgoing recognition for authentic impact.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—completing forbidden art as rebellion—escalates through accumulating pain and risk ("Each puncture was a step in a forgotten dance"). The nostalgia ban provides coherent background pressure. Cost is visible in physical pain and the permanence of exile, though the external threat remains abstract rather than immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening as Elian moves from frustration to throwing the stone to seeing the ripples' meaning, with each beat tightening his understanding. The cost is felt in his prior misplaced motivation and the looming port expansion, though the stakes could press harder in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—translating pain into meaning others can use—deepens through the box's revelation (tooth and hair) that "devastates" him. The pressure accumulates through texture rather than reversal, with Elias's agency manifest in his choice to transform from silent keeper to speaker. Cost is visible in his scars and "every dream" traded for strangers' lives.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (finding hope's equation) is clear but escalation under the accumulative lens is subtle - primarily through the parallel timeline perception and pattern recognition. The breakthrough moment lands but lacks the visceral pressure that would make the cost undeniable. The resolution feels more like completion than transformation achieved through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from academic curiosity to moral imperative as Elara discovers the truth, with the wall's "scream" forcing her confrontation with complicity. The burden transforms from personal to collective through her agency. Cost is visible in her choice to carry testimony. Minor deduction for somewhat predictable escalation pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from attempting the piece to sacrificing life force when the vision wavers - a clear tightening that forecloses the option of creating without personal cost. The bells create time pressure. However, the conflict lacks a strong oppositional force beyond the technical challenge itself.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal burden through memories to the delegates' tense arrival and final handshake. The line "She translated hostility into practicality, grief into compromise" shows meaningful deepening under accumulative pressure, with cost visible in "the agonizing, meticulous work of peace."

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation follows causal logic: manufactured drought → storm breaks control → internal pressure builds → release decision. The cost is unmistakable (losing the irreplaceable egg). One meaningful tightening occurs as the rain forces recognition that he's the egg's "jailer." Doesn't reach 8.8+ because the external storm does more work than protagonist agency in driving the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through thread accumulation—cobalt poet, vermilion warrior—each increasing the "torrent of might-have-beens" flowing through Elara. The final silver thread as her own echo creates meaningful tightening with visible cost. Agency manifests through deliberate untangling despite "exquisitely painful" resistance, foreclosing her gilded cage path.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—how truth should be told—escalates through Elara's recognition that "her perfect calligraphy could be ignored; his ragged puppets could not." The cost is legible when she destroys her manuscripts and enters Kael's territory. The tightening occurs through her realization forcing a complete methodological reversal with visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch migration—faces meaningful disruption when the hawk's violence introduces the moth wing, forcing Silas to expand his memorial's scope. The butterflies' unexpected vortex around the moth-adorned structure deepens the stake. Cost is visible but the escalation relies more on accumulation than active agency, fitting the textural lens but limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (preserving the lost melody) escalates through technical failure threatening to compound her original loss. The rope discovery creates meaningful deepening that changes her options. Cost is visible in accepting the "unfixable mistake" while finding a way forward, though the resolution arrives somewhat conveniently through the discovered rope's properties.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from system preservation to existential understanding, with the storm creating temporal pressure that forces the seal-breaking decision. The dominant stake (discovering purpose) tightens through dream analysis to seal-breaking to revelation. Cost appears in accepting the "grand and tragic error" though agency in transcendence could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through repeated failures that drain resolve, each attempt narrowing options until surrender becomes the only path. The cost is legible in Elara abandoning her life's work and methodology. Strong agency in the final choice to "simply offer her presence." Slight deduction for the entity appearance feeling externally driven rather than purely character-generated.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from Lyra's entry to Kael's hand on sword to his final surrender, with clear cost in releasing his duty-bound resentment. The pressure coheres around whether memory can substitute for mechanism. One meaningful tightening through dialogue that narrows Kael's options.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (capturing fleeting dream) through technical (rebuilding sextant) to perceptual (synchronizing breath with vision's frequency). The "single misstep" tension and breathing technique create meaningful tightening. Cost is visible in surrendering rational certainty for dual perception. One significant deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from external threat (cathedral destruction) to internal recognition (self-imprisonment) to action (leaving sanctuary), with the ribbon discovery as the turning mechanism. The Council's quick capitulation weakens the final pressure slightly, though cost remains visible.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from cataloging duty through forbidden knowledge to cosmic inheritance, with the bathroom lock representing meaningful risk under institutional rules. The vision deepens understanding and forecloses Elara's return to mere curation. Minor deduction because the external pressure remains largely internal after the initial setup—no active opposition tests her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from quest to survival when the predator arrives, with pressure cohering through Silas's linguistic solution. The protagonist's agency drives resolution through researching gaps rather than fighting. Cost is visible in the "wisdom purchased too dearly" but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding the garden of forgotten names—evolves meaningfully from seeking a place to understanding it as a state of being. The pressure deepens through the journal discovery, forcing Elara to reconfigure her entire understanding. The cost is visible in her acceptance of permanent anchorage to the ship.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity about the missing document to confronting reality's unraveling, with the unstable environment ("Gears flickered in and out of solidity") creating urgency. The protagonist's agency drives resolution, though the conflict lacks a strong oppositional force beyond the abstract wrongness.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from finding quiet to actively transforming chaos through the stone's "terrified heart" pulsing. The cost is legible when Kaelyn exhausts herself channeling the energy. However, the actual conflict with the energy beings happened before the story begins, limiting present-tense pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from maintaining a dead beacon through discovering the prism to the specific challenge of finding "the one, specific path." The dominant stake—proving coincidences have meaning—tightens when Elara must trace an "aberrant star-path" from collapse night. Cost accumulates through "weeks" of calculation with "hope as fragile and persistent as the thistles." The moment of apparent failure ("crushing weight") before success creates earned reversal, though the resolution could show more immediate consequence beyond sending the signal.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation works texturally through accumulating imagery: from "deepening hush" to "absolute" silence to final darkness. The fog's solidification creates genuine time pressure. However, lacks a sharp middle turn—the shadow examination doesn't sufficiently tighten options before the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal rebellion to historical dialogue when Sparrow discovers the mosaic. The pressure coheres through his methodical preparation building to the finale where he literally sets the command ablaze. Cost is visible in the people's changed posture - "The weight was not gone, but they remembered they could bear it."

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture to bridge generational conflict—deepens through the vision sequence that transforms abstract disagreement into embodied understanding. Cost is visible in Kael's vulnerability ("I thought I'd lost it") and Ayla's recognition of his fear. The tangential approach creates organic escalation rather than forced confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: confined space → gravity inversion → ejection into sky → encounter with trellis. The dominant stake (Elara's need for expansion versus safety) tightens when she must choose to leave the doll. Cost is visible but the middle section could apply more pressure to the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as density increase from initial quiet through "grating drone" to pure tone to expansive hush. The dominant stake (transforming disruptive noise into comfort) tightens when Elara must act precisely as the storm glass shows increasing agitation. Cost is visible in the old woman's transformation, though agency remains somewhat passive-observational.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from data preservation to physical journey to evasion sequence, with the dominant stake (finding the ascension path) maintained throughout. The orchard's defense system creates concrete pressure requiring immediate tactical response. The sunrise deadline adds temporal urgency. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off—Kaelen gains the knowledge without paying a visceral price beyond leaving the orchard.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from the youth's suffocation through scar-sharing to the burning iron choice. The cost manifests in physical pain and Kael's dissolution. The pressure builds appropriately under the accumulative lens, though the middle scar-sharing section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from cryptic warning to physical danger ("Tiny, sharp facets began to bloom... slicing the sleeve"). The pressure literally crystallizes, forcing immediate action. Elara's agency drives the resolution through her "virtuously mischievous plan" to redirect the force.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering family truth—escalates from physical search to mechanical operation to the supernatural revelation. The cost manifests in Lysander becoming "forever bound" to the place and truth. The ritualistic turning creates tension through sustained action rather than reversals, appropriate for the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking possibility to confronting the queen's memory to choosing liberation over guilt, with clear cost in releasing his knight identity. The marionette's transformation and Valerius's parallel divestment create meaningful pressure, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily after the single moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discoveries: box→file→letter→button's meaning, each deepening Elias's understanding with emotional cost visible in his "breath caught." The dominant stake (finding meaning in grief through others' stories) tightens effectively. Could push further into active choice rather than receptive discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative reveals: failed contact → puddle map → lagoon discovery → archive retrieval, each deepening the memory-versus-indifference stake. The protagonist's agency drives each transition, from choosing to follow the reflection to using the grandfather's key. Cost is legible in the "immense weight" of truth and the commitment to "slow, deliberate" work against collective amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy's fulfillment—is established early and tested through the musical duel. The prophecy "fought back" and "grew frantic, sharper," creating genuine escalation. Cost is visible in Elara's physical exhaustion and the "temporary stay against an inevitable entropy."

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: sorting leads to discovery, discovery to monument-building, monuments to transformation. The cost is legible when Aisling "became their story"—losing individual identity to gain universal knowledge. The stakes deepen from personal curiosity to existential change.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure: three market encounters, the compass's persistent pointing, then physical journey into unknown space. The stakes deepen from professional identity crisis to existential reconfiguration. Cost is visible in abandoning her life's organizing principle—"her anchor, but it was also her cage."

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from statistical improbability to alchemical exploration to the discovery of Leo trapped in the furnace. The dominant stake (finding/understanding Leo) tightens when the glowing path leads downward rather than away. Cost appears in Leo's lost voice and terror, though the resolution could pressure Elara's capabilities more severely.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from pursuing a fractured spirit to confronting Kael's core shame about deserving his fate. The harp's dissonance creating vulnerability deepens to capturing laughter through the crocodile tooth. Cost is legible when Kael's "luminous ache" transforms but requires his dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure from passive victim to active agent, with the strap removal as the tightening moment that transforms observation into action. The shift from being experimented upon to choosing his "first deliberate act of grace" forecloses the path of passive suffering with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (uncovering grandmother's hidden truth) escalates through the lens revealing layers within the painting. The tightening occurs when the secondary painting exposes the documenter's secret action. Cost is visible in Elara's trembling hands and the "weight of the pages," though peak pressure could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to maintain professional distance or acknowledge the ghost's heroism—escalates through the vision sequence where Leo witnesses her sacrifice. The cost manifests in his breaking of personal protocol ("never to engage") and accepting the "cool, solid truth" of her story. However, the conflict could benefit from more resistance before his choice to engage.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (breaking perfect stasis) escalates through accumulating pressure: from recognizing the system's hollowness to discovering the frost-key to the decisive press-pull. The cost is legible—destroying unique, transient beauty to create lasting change. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the conflict could tighten slightly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving the peaceful nature of the lost civilization—intensifies through the ion storm sequence, with Kaelen's methodology shifting from analytical to poetic. The escalation works texturally rather than causally, though the final cost of isolation feels somewhat predetermined rather than arising from the specific choice to pursue this proof.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal craft (mending music boxes) to cosmic restoration (reclaiming eternal noon), with Silas's betrayal forcing Elian to choose between physical collapse and creative action. The cost manifests viscerally as Elian wilts, clutching his workbench while channeling his final act. One meaningful tightening that forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: surface collecting → descent → visions → submersion → surrender. The "hinged awakenings" during psychometry reading effectively tighten pressure. Cost is legible in releasing the compass and abandoning collection. Minor issue: the stakes could be more viscerally felt during the underwater sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: shelter-seeking becomes world-saving as "the seam was tearing." The storm serves as both immediate threat and cosmic force attacking the boundary. Elara's agency drives resolution through her sculpting skills. The ticking clock ("The way is closing") creates genuine urgency with visible cost in her "frantic certainty."

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (understanding emptiness through the flower question) tightens when the cathedral light reveals the cosmic diagram, forcing Elara to reckon with her grandmother's true intention. Cost is visible in the emotional transformation from isolation to connection. The escalation is more accumulative than causal, appropriate for the textural lens but lacking a sharp reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from academic research to witnessing murder to becoming testimony's vessel, with the lagoon's supernatural response forcing stance crystallization. The dominant stake (uncovering suppressed truth) tightens through each revelation, though Kenneth's preserved consciousness arrives somewhat conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reimagining civilization from ashes—deepens through Elara's methodical process, with the bottle's true nature providing meaningful escalation. The cost manifests in her complete absorption into the town's memories and the weight of resurrecting context rather than people. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as her understanding builds toward the climactic reading.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    The conflict escalates naturally from routine archiving through accidental prophecy to moral dilemma, with the cylinder's physical flaw creating irreversible stakes. The tension between oath and consequence creates genuine pressure, though the prophecy's specific danger could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preservation to active restoration as Elias chooses to "pour life back through" rather than escape. The method of "decreasing entropy" creates genuine tension as he fights natural law itself. Cost is visible in his choice to remain while sending life backward, though the resolution's ease slightly undermines the promised difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds from brewing storm → conflicting data → the switch "pulsing, demanding" → bell's vibration forcing decision. The tightening moment where Elara must choose between trusted noise (switch) and uncertain truth (bell) narrows options with palpable stakes, though the storm's convenient turn slightly undercuts earned consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to compulsion to confrontation with the AI's quarantine protocol. The cost manifests in Orion's physical toll and the risk of losing the glass, though the AI's instant capitulation reduces final tension.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from observing ghosts to understanding their silent language to accepting responsibility for the woman-ghost's urgent need. The pressure coheres through her "vibrating with desperate silence" and builds to Silas accepting the weight of preservation. Cost is visible in the "tangible weight" settling on his shoulders and the permanent commitment to safeguarding their stories.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from Leo's private obsession through the public vulnerability of the garage sale to the crushing disappointment when messages go unnoticed, then reverse through the woman's recognition. The dominant stake—finding meaning in unmeasurable time—tightens when Leo risks exposure through his cryptic messages. Cost is visible in his "bitter and expected" disappointment before the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake - discovering beauty in the incomplete - is signaled early and tested through the kite incident. However, escalation is minimal; the transformation unfolds without resistance or complication, and the child's grief serves as backdrop rather than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's systematic wire-wrapping building toward the pivotal contact moment. The tension between her diminishing time and the lithicores' geological patience creates genuine pressure. The cost (her life given for future understanding) is legible, though the lithicores' response feels slightly too convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: solitary walk, amber discovery, convergence revelation, internal fissuring. The dominant stake (understanding vs. accepting the ineffable) tightens when data points "shift, realign in uncomfortable ways." Cost is visible in her core identity cracking, though the conflict could press harder in places.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening as Elros moves from walking to listening to seeding to speaking, each action narrowing his commitment to this restorative work. The shore lark's melody signals "clean earth and maturing grubs," triggering his decisive seeding action. Cost is visible in his acceptance of slowness—"the smallest of sounds, a private, vital mechanics"—foreclosing any path of forced or rapid healing.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking sound frequencies to discovering the leaf's hidden map, with Argus's renewed purpose adding emotional weight. The revelation transforms an impossible journey into a trackable path with clear danger. Cost is visible in the "brutal reality of desolation and danger" they must face.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from survival to purpose as the temporal stretch transforms from curse to "unique instrument." The discovery moment creates genuine escalation under the accumulative lens, with cost visible in accepting permanent exile as the price of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from theft mission to philosophical test when the keeper appears, forcing Kaelen to choose between his thief instincts and higher understanding. The cost is concrete (his treasured fox) and the pressure narrows from multiple options to a single meaningful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from private memorial to life-or-death when the soldier appears, forcing Elara from observer to participant. The cost is clear: she abandons her "sacred text" role of pure documentation. The "benevolently ruthless" tension pays off when her ruthlessness "pivots to the present," though the soldier's immediate trust feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking understanding to actively navigating by touch alone: "She did not look with her mercury-glass eyes. She ran the feather over her palm." The cost crystallizes when finding the stone doesn't eliminate visions but transforms them into "a quiet, foundational hum"—a reweighting rather than escape.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through decoding the tapestry to discovering the plinth's purpose, with Kael's agency driving each step. The dominant stake of breaking the curse/finding absolution tightens when he realizes he's "not just a prisoner" but "a player." Cost appears in risking his only comfort object to potentially fail, though the resolution could show more immediate trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear: singular confession versus multiple perspectives. The child's question creates the pivotal disruption that enables Kaelen's intervention. Cost is visible in the shift from "simple penance" to "exhausting, painful, necessary work" of collective understanding. Minor deduction for the relatively smooth transition—more resistance from the High Speaker could heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from repair attempt to revelation to transformation, with the charm discovery forcing a fundamental change in approach. The cost is tangible - permanently binding the destructive element into the repair - though the statue's animation slightly deflates the earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Elias's self-imprisonment in nostalgia versus breaking free—escalates through the cave journey to the shell discovery. The cost is legible: decades of stasis revealed through the preserved promise. One meaningful deepening occurs when finding the shell transforms his understanding of his entire artistic life.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (proving whispers over shouts while saving the fleet) is established early and tested through Elias's experimental action. The moment of doubt ("Had he been a fool?") before the boats turn provides meaningful tension. However, the resolution lacks complication—every boat responds perfectly, reducing the sense of earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from station failure to the final transmission, with each step narrowing options: hydraulics gone, static position, accelerated schedule, last power reserves. The dominant stake—preserving humanity's essence before death—intensifies through resource depletion. Cost is unmistakable: Elara's life traded for the archive's survival.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from seeking silence to confronting the seductive trap of borrowed consciousness, with the storm's arrival forcing immediate decision under pressure. The cost is legible in choosing momentary clarity over permanent escape, though the single reversal (cure discovered → rejected → repurposed) could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: physical evidence yields to "borrowed memories," then the woman's arrival forces resolution. The gap between "devotion, courage" and "despair of a suicide" creates productive tension. Cost registers in Emil's deterioration and the woman's grief, though Silas's personal stakes could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual puzzle to physical journey to existential recognition, with the rising creek creating time pressure. However, the journey lacks significant obstacles once she enters the tunnel - the discovery feels too smooth, missing a moment of genuine doubt or physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: recurring dream → comet warning → solo climb → cosmic communion. The stakes deepen from kingdom's safety to soul's understanding, with visible cost in abandoning guards and royal identity. The "bleeding starlight" transforms from menace to communion, a strong reweighting under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear - weeks of work failing, the need to capture "density of presence." The spiral discovery creates meaningful deepening that changes Lyra's options from force to flow. Cost is visible in the abandoned approach and emotional investment, though the resolution feels slightly smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with mortality through narrative—deepens effectively from jealousy to acceptance. The soaring sequence represents genuine agency that reframes her relationship to chaos. Cost is legible in her "weary awe" and the foreclosed path of her earlier compulsion to impose order.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure builds through Silas's demonstration of attention to minutiae ("dewdrop on the windowpane in exquisite detail") and crystallizes when the mother's arrival forces Elara to act without her primary tool. The cost is legible as she must abandon her scent-based practice for presence-based care.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the physical crystallization threatening to derail the ceremony, forcing Elara to employ the childhood breath-holding technique. The cost manifests visibly in the "translucent, beautiful lattice of fortified flesh." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation occurs through induced currents that force Finch to experience "the entirety of his passion" - a deepening that changes his state from mechanical repetition to conscious awareness. Cost is visible in both the orchard's destruction and Elara's decade-long guilt, though the conflict could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (unraveling cosmic illusions to understand existence) builds through the Witness's deliberate spiral construction, with the universe's "hiccup" providing external pressure that forces him to complete his millennia-long arbitration. The cost manifests as the dissolution of individual histories into unified luminescence, though the escalation could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from discordant sound to catastrophic system failure, with clear cost in the "cumulative error" becoming "irreversible." The ticking clock of degradation creates genuine pressure. However, the resolution through counting backwards feels somewhat convenient - the solution appears without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (understanding how to handle the intrusion) escalates from defensive posture to revolutionary acceptance, with clear cost in vulnerability. The pressure coheres well under the causal lens as each realization narrows her options toward the adaptive solution. Minor deduction for the relatively low external pressure—the conflict remains largely internal.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from solving a puzzle to understanding a man to discovering secret philanthropy, each revelation narrowing Elara's emotional options. The cost manifests in her complicated tears—neither pure sadness nor joy. One meaningful deepening through the people he helped, though middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation as each call adds complexity to the "symphony," with the woman's pain becoming "melody," then connecting to the man, then incorporating the young voice. The dominant stake of connection-through-error intensifies effectively. Minor deduction for relatively gentle pressure compared to what the concept could demand.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from professional duty through personal discovery to unexpected delivery, with the mother's sacrifice providing genuine weight. The son's arrival creates meaningful pressure that transforms preservation into restoration. Cost is visible in Elara's choice and Kaelin's emotional response.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—curing loneliness through connection—escalates from Elias's general practice to Clara's specific "gravity well" of loss, forcing him to create something new rather than his usual referral. The cost manifests in Clara's year of isolation and Elias's recognition that simple companionship won't suffice. The reciprocity principle creates coherent pressure but lacks a sharper tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (finding the source of dream-sorrow) escalates through sensory intensification: chaos resolving to melody, melody leading to silence, silence revealing truth. The cost is legible when Elian sinks "overwhelmed by the truth" and his compass permanently reorients, though the forest's trauma remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from stranded → equipment failure → frustration → methodological shift → breakthrough. The gravitational lurch that sends the pen rolling creates the accidental discovery. Cost is clear: literal blood and accepting counterintuitive thinking.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.7)
    The yacht's intrusion creates genuine escalation by forcing Elara to abandon her passive role and risk exposure, with clear cost in her return to anonymity. The story's single tightening move—from mapping to conducting—meaningfully forecloses her observer path, though additional pressure points could deepen the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through artistic trail creation, each marker raising commitment to the search. The palm-press moment crystallizes risk before the reveal. Cost manifests in erasure—destroying her own creations to protect the secret. One meaningful deepening through discovery, though physical danger remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative drumming intensity: prescribed rhythms → complex staccato beat → reality warping → synchronized defiance across distance. The dominant stake (preserving authentic memory versus accepting treatment) tightens when Elara discovers the true purpose of treatment is severing her bond. Cost is legible when physical connection is gained then immediately lost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating navigation challenges and the risk of Elara's unsanctioned experiment. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as sensory details intensify toward the whispered proof. Slight deduction for the relatively low personal cost - while professional risk exists, the emotional stakes could cut deeper.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure: routine → darkness swelling → light failing → empathy projection → stellar weaving. The shift from defensive light-weaving to offering darkness "a memory of stars" represents genuine tactical evolution with clear cost—Elara must abandon her usual method.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal motivation to collective action through Elara's arrival—her fear crystallizes his protective impulse into action. The window display method creates genuine risk under the Director's ban. Cost is visible in the transformation from "amplified quiet" of isolation to "full of promise." Minor deduction because the Director remains abstract without embodied opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: discovery leads to call, call to island, island to choice. The mental severing "more difficult than any physical feat" shows genuine cost, though the absence of concrete opposition in the pacified world slightly dulls the pressure compared to what active resistance might provide.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    The flower stem's crack creates genuine escalation under the textural lens, forcing Elias from passive whittling to active protection. His "fierce and startling protectiveness" represents the first authentic feeling since the Mandate, with clear cost in abandoning his numbness. The transformation from carving away to weaving together deepens meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation follows accumulative deepening as Elara moves from approaching to touching to merging with the Colonnade's resonance. The dominant stake—finding form for the formless—tightens when she abandons "literal translation" for dissolution. Cost is visible in the ephemeral poem that "dissolves, its energy returning to the air."

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—gaining true sight versus preserving unique perspective—escalates through the barter negotiation and peaks with the irreversible exchange. The cost is visible (loss of original vision, gain of something stranger). However, the transformation itself lacks resistance or complication, proceeding too smoothly once initiated.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—discovering authentic connection—intensifies when Elara risks inserting herself into the sequence. This tightening forecloses her detached conductor role with visible cost as she must become vulnerable. The child's laughter emerging unbidden demonstrates earned consequence, though pressure could sharpen further in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief to discovering purpose through the observatory's revelation, with Elara's agency driving the search and interpretation. The indigo curtain vision provides meaningful deepening that reframes her craft, though the origami trail lacks intermediate pressure or cost—it's a breadcrumb path without obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from private cartomantic inquiry to collaborative repair, with the measuring tape's repurposing marking the decisive deepening that reweights value from abstract to tangible. Mr. Gable's interruption forces Elara from solitary practice to shared action, though the resolution's ease (finding and fixing the leak) slightly undercuts the established complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from pursuing forbidden knowledge to confronting civilization-ending transcendence. The archive's pattern-detection defenses force genuine tactical adaptation. The final temptation—dissolution into cosmic peace—presents maximum pressure with visible cost in her rejection.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from preserving dreams to containing a parasitic entity that feeds on hope. The investigation tightens through video comparison revealing the entity's progression, with Aris's infection raising personal cost. Her agency drives the discovery and containment choice, though the entity's exact threat mechanism could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving compassion versus hardening after betrayal—escalates through Elias's physical reconstruction work, with each cleared layer of damaged foliage representing trust being "consciously peeled away." The tension peaks when he places the shed tail in fresh soil, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off or irreversible foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (freeing creativity) escalates from city's flickering sky through arduous journey to final alignment ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (stabilizing volatile fragments) escalates when the burning memory threatens to "infect" other strands. The charming sequence shows agency through wave-function manipulation with visible effort. However, the resolution feels slightly too smooth—the fragment's transformation lacks sufficient resistance to maximize tension.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)

    Stakes are clear—finding an ancient weapon to reignite hope during the ceasefire's limited window. Pressure builds through textural accumulation ("thunderous serenity...like the moment before a lightning strike") to Elara's decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation accumulates through textural deepening: finding amber → discovering the kite's script → translating via plants → unsealing mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from observing time dilation during eclipse, to discovering the ink patterns, to actively engaging them with water, culminating in the drone's disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation follows accumulative logic well—from personal unease to collective silence to sonic tapestry revelation. The philosopher's interruption provides adequate complication. However, his instant conversion undermines some earned tension, and the resolution could use more visceral cost beyond the philosophical acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from mechanical puzzle to cosmic repair ("a fragment of time itself"), with the mirrors showing "infinite failures" before the moonlight revelation creates the decisive turn. The pressure builds through failed attempts, with each rejected gear narrowing options until the prophecy's meaning clicks. Cost is visible in the consumed eclipse-light, though the personal stakes could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulating messages, growing settler doubt, then the map leading to revelation—each step narrowing options. The cost of Aelia's nightly manifestations and the settlers' faith-testing labor is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate from mechanical repair to existential choice about ending vs. continuation. The puppet head discovery creates genuine reversal—from fixing to listening/answering. Final cost is legible: accepting rest means releasing control, letting go of the world. Pressure coheres through accumulation of adjusters' "collective exhaustion" leading to Elara's decisive permission.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear escalation from wanderer spotted to birds diving to discovery that transforms understanding. The frost deadline creates genuine urgency. However, the resolution depends more on fortunate discovery than protagonist agency—Kaelen uses the key, but the woman's stumbling reveals it, slightly weakening the agency component.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation operates through deepening observation rather than external conflict, with the foam patterns providing the key tightening that transforms understanding from "rigid" to "fluid" approaches. The cost manifests as professional failure and broken trust with Lena, though the internal pressure could intensify more dramatically through the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories begin—deepens through the encounter as Elara discovers her true role. The man's glimmering parole creates immediate pressure with its fragility. The surgical incision sequence escalates through projected memories to the final liberation, with clear cost in the darkened bottle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing stored remorse from poisoning the world—is signaled early and escalates through Kaelen's descent and contact with the oyster. The pressure tightens from tasting memories on walls to being flooded with "a wave of profound, crippling grief" that "nearly drove him to his knees." The cost is legible in his physical collapse and psychic grinding, though the external threat ("someday escape") could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on mending "fractured conversations between disparate districts" with clear escalation from diagnosis (clock is "sick") through physical repair to the miraculous response. The weight's isolation mirrors the silos' problem, creating thematic pressure. However, no significant opposition or complication challenges Elara's repair—success feels somewhat predetermined despite the earned symbolic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate from technical test to existential encounter with the murdered dream of her predecessor. The "quaking reverie" threatens madness, and Elara's struggle to "hold them all" shows genuine risk. The cost manifests physically ("cheeks wet with another man's tears") and psychologically as she absorbs his failure to fuel her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: from obsessive research to physical risk during inversion to accepting sentinel responsibility. The tightening occurs when Elara must decide whether to archive or embody the seeds' power, with clear cost ("not a gift, but a responsibility"). The one-hour time limit creates effective pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—creating music in silence—faces escalating pressure through repeated failure, the discovery of the cracked sculpture, and the forensic analysis that changes her approach. The shift from forcing to inviting music represents meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in the "generation" without sound and the single note's humility against what's needed.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from Kael's exile/ritual to the cartographer's crisis, with the Nexus phase creating time pressure. The tightening occurs when Kael must find the "lost frequency" before the phase locks. Cost is somewhat abstract ("terrible, beautiful truth") rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from unlocking a physical clasp to unlocking understanding of her grandfather's worldview to reconceptualizing her life's work. The fireworks create external pressure that forces internal reckoning. Cost is visible in Ariadne's acceptance that her pure silence catalog must expand to include noise ("To love the silence, one must first forgive the sound").

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (cultivating serenity within motion) faces meaningful escalation when Elara's impatience triggers the plant's defensive scent release, forcing her to confront the contradiction in her approach. The cost is embodied through her recoiling and gasping, then accepting the overwhelming sensory assault.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gravity inversion creates genuine crisis ("terrifying sight" of exposed roots) that forces Kaelen to adapt her navigation, leading to discovery. Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to planetary stewardship with clear cost—she must protect what she's found. The pressure coheres well under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds from atmospheric anomaly through physical evidence to temporal convergence threat, with Vale's understanding deepening at each discovery. The stakes crystallize when she realizes the port is "becoming a focal point" for catastrophe. However, the resolution through transmission lacks immediate dramatic cost—we don't see if her intervention succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal ennui to cosmic certification of wonder, with the cavern's resonance as the testing ground. The protagonist's agency drives the climactic humming/conducting sequence. Visible cost in the dissolution of the amber sheet and ice block. Minor deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of "certifying wonder" despite the concrete manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding failure to harvest insight—escalates through Elara's progression from arranging markers to crossing worlds to confronting spectral failures. The cost is visible in her willingness to unravel herself. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment; the journey proceeds relatively smoothly once she decides to use the flute.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate from measuring others' emotions to confronting "the one emotion whose equation remained a paradox: her own loneliness," with each empathic swap increasing cost. The archivist sequence demonstrates real consequence—"the calculation of his ruin unfolding"—before Elara's final inward turn. The feedback loop of borrowed personalities creates genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: routine delivery becomes urgent when the hermit thrusts back the humming pendant ("It was meant for him! For Kael!"), forcing Silas's choice to raise it despite fear, triggering the ridgeway's transformation. The cost is legible—accepting his mentor's legacy means acknowledging Kael's permanent loss while taking on an undefined but clearly greater responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening: from confident practice to despair to unexpected discovery. The dominant stake (proving objects absorb emotions) tightens when the prism fails, forcing Elara to confront potential life waste. Cost is visible when her core belief transforms entirely—she finds truth but not the human emotion she sought.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through pattern deepening: from nightly unraveling to discovering the amber/puzzle to recognizing the loom must be destroyed. The "raveling silence" creates active opposition, and Elara's agency drives the solution through artifact interpretation. Cost is unmistakable—her entire life's work sacrificed—though the middle lacks a sharper intermediate pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (rebuilding with resilience) escalates through the mine's psychic assault that "scrambled her thoughts," forcing Elara to use the silk as a tactile anchor—a concrete tightening of pressure. The bartered awakening scene crystallizes cost when she trades memories for knowledge, though the return journey and forge work lack comparable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes escalate beautifully from personal mystery to understanding sacrifice to accepting dangerous purpose. The revelation that Elara's ability resonates with Aris's redirect creates meaningful tightening. Cost is unmistakable: from seeking truth to bearing its terrible weight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from equipment failure to supernatural encounter to protective stance, with the letters raising stakes from personal safety to preserving connection. The temperature drop and door's violent opening effectively tighten pressure. Cost is visible in Elias's defensive stand against "ancient grief," though the resolution's ease slightly undermines full tension.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Silas's ability to shape fate through the lighthouse—escalates from routine duty through storm management to the realization of historical impact. The "millimeter" adjustment creating the light loop provides clear causal pressure. Cost manifests in his transformation from laughing herald to someone gripped by "fearful awe" at his power.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - understanding why some magnetize stories - deepens through the sun-trail navigation and tea house revelation. Cost is visible in Hira's transformation from observer to participant in narrative. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment; the revelation arrives somewhat smoothly despite strong atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: routine measurement → special directive → climbing the tower → waiting for moonlight → seeing through the sextant → discovering the trees' sacrifice. The dominant stake (understanding grief's true purpose) tightens when Elara sees "the deconstruction of her own long-held belief," with the cost visible in the trees' voluntary burden.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes established immediately through "dying realm before its final light was extinguished forever," with pressure mounting as Elara struggles against failing memory. The touch of the mica window provides the key tightening moment, transforming solitary preservation into collective action. Cost manifests in the "bound release"—simultaneous unleashing and tightening—though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without intermediate obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: from hiding the invitation to crossing the threshold to confronting the preserved error. The midnight deadline creates urgency, and her reframing of the mistake as containing "its own contradiction at the core, like a seed holding a poisonous flower" demonstrates meaningful deepening with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to shared resistance against "creeping normality," with the revelation deepening rather than reversing the conflict. The cost of maintaining this sacred space—"tenuous absolution" dependent on continued belief—is clear. The final planting of saffron crocuses shows agency through collective action against decay.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from preserving dying knowledge to discovering the library's living purpose, with pressure building through the meticulous frequency sampling process. The cost is legible in the library's stasis and the spent slide, though agency remains somewhat passive through the discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from searching through "false starts" to the confrontation where "comforting unease curdled into pure tension." The hand-grip becomes the decisive pressure point where history and betrayal collide, with clear cost in trust's audible breaking.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through sensory accumulation—from observing individual weather-bearers to the "explosion" of converged climates to the golden calm at center—with the compass needle's progression from dead to twitching to spinning to pointing creating clear stakes. The cost of abandoning scientific distance for participation is legible, though one more beat of internal resistance would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncorking suppressed creativity—escalates from passive suffering through violent defiance to active transformation. The strongbox's resistance and subsequent opening narrow Alistair's options toward confronting his true calling. Cost is legible in "wasted years" and the physical transformation of his charcoal-stained fingers to color-stained ones, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to city salvation as Elara discovers the true water source. The plumber's confession provides meaningful reversal that restores her strength, and the final discovery forces a choice between safety and truth-telling with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through textural intensification - from sensing discord to discovering the dying ice to the precise recalibration work. The temporary nature of Elara's fix ("fleeting fix") establishes ongoing cost, though the conflict lacks a sharp reversal or complication that would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from internal static to magnetic amplification to potential catatonia, with the box opening as the decisive risk. The compression method shows clear agency, and the rose's absorption creates visible cost through its transformation. Minor limitation: the "controlled burn escape" feels slightly convenient, though the setup of organic roses accepting energy partially earns it.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving that listening heals—escalates through the accumulation of Anya's story fragments, culminating in Leo's confession. While the pressure builds steadily, the resolution relies heavily on coincidence (Leo's arrival precisely when Elara finds the locket), and the stakes remain primarily emotional rather than testing multiple dimensions of cost.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through pattern accumulation—each cipher solution deepens Elara's isolation until the dice alignment forces her to confront and encrypt her own vulnerability. The reversal (using her defensive cipher as the liberation key) creates meaningful cost, though middle sections could tighten pressure more consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulative density: gravity pockets intensify, coffee grounds reveal urgency, physical excavation demands hours of labor. The cost is legible in Elara's "agonizing minute" pinned to rock and the final acceptance of partial recovery, though middle pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes established immediately as "terrestrial rearrangement of catastrophic proportions." Escalation tracks through mapping the prophecy's shape, finding its core syllable, then the final concentrated effort of "silent supernova." Cost visible in the methodical, "agonizingly slow" work.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from learning a building's language to inheriting a supernatural custodianship. The "agreed upon lies" create tension that builds toward revelation during meteor shower. Cost is legible: Mr. Valerius fades/dies, Elara accepts isolation and responsibility. One meaningful deepening through the reveal, though could use stronger mid-story pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from physical discovery through emotional recognition ("shudder of recognition, deep and unwelcome") to full memory recovery with brother's death. The cost is clear—accepting grief to live fully. However, the protagonist's agency is somewhat passive after placing the shell; the Archive does most of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (saving brother) to political (treasonous forgery) to revelation of state-sanctioned deception. Varos's arrival creates genuine pressure—arrest seems imminent until the reversal. The dominant stake (correcting fatal orders) tightens when Varos reveals the missing tremor detail, then transforms when he provides the seal. Cost is legible throughout: brother's life, Kaelin's risk, the Queen's political bind.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to sacred duty through the shell's progressive disclosure, with clear tightening when Elara discovers her true lineage. The cost—surrendering individual identity to become part of the eternal chorus—is visible and felt. Slightly weakened by lack of active opposition or complicating pressure in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—exposing the devastating lie—drives coherent pressure through Elara's methodical investigation. The revelation of insurance fraud "gone catastrophically wrong" provides meaningful escalation from accident to intentional act. However, the conflict lacks immediate resistance; Elara faces no active opposition or cost to her discovery beyond the abstract weight of truth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes emerge through accumulation: fireflies trapped by human lights, Ren's solitary mission, Lin's question about unrecognized work. The tension builds through textural deepening rather than reversal, with the moon-path revelation reweighting all prior observations. Cost manifests in the "silent toil" and acceptance of invisibility.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from simple debunking to world-changing discovery to moral choice about weaponization. The storm creates pressure that forces Elara's work forward, and the revelation about the stillpoint raises the cost of exposure. The final decision shows clear agency with visible trade-off between her compulsion for truth and protecting the sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from solitary listening to competitive faction pressure when the Aerie discovers the transmissions, forcing Cassian's choice between "power, resources" and the "fragmented path." The simultaneous voices creating "dissonant roar that threatened to shatter his mind" effectively tightens pressure, with the cost visible in the sparking console and temporary darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from preserving stories to freeing the locked melody to finding its human vessel, with clear escalation through weeks of searching. The cost appears in Orin's "trembling" hands and the acknowledgment of cultural forgetting, though the personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from initial threat through failed aggressive command to successful harmonization. The ice's violent response ("thunderous crack," floe slamming pilings) creates genuine pressure. One meaningful reversal when the harsh frequency fails, forcing tactical shift.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation - from tracking, to storm passing, to triple moon convergence, to awakening. The dominant stake (patient revolution vs impatience) tightens as the moment arrives. Cost is visible in Elara's final transformation, though the middle section could use one more beat of active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (understanding Leo's death) deepens through the psychic revelation, but escalation relies heavily on a single moment rather than progressive tightening. The cost is more conceptual than visceral - Elara's transformation lacks immediate dramatic consequence beyond her "unorthodox report."

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from repairing a mechanical object to understanding redemption itself, with the bent pivot arm discovery creating the decisive turn. The "calm before realization" builds appropriate pressure. Cost is visible in Vale's tears and the prisoner's death having preceded this moment of grace.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (ringing the unheard bell to shift reality) is signaled early and tested through concrete obstacles. Escalation follows causal pressure: years of searching → finding the arrow → machine failure creates the reversal → kaleidoscope solution. The cost manifests in Fix's years of lonely obsession and the world-altering consequence of success, though the personal price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity through corporate cover-up to existential threat as the numbers become "a countdown, a signal getting closer to home." Each discovery narrows Elara's options - she can't unknow what she's learned. The final realization that deletion means absorption creates irreversible knowledge with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from territorial intrusion to village survival with clear tightening when the reconstituted vision reveals "timeline imminent." The avalanche threat provides coherent external pressure that forces Elara's choice between static duty and dynamic intervention. Cost is visible in abandoning her post and the physical/social effort of mobilization.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulation: from seeking her own end, to finding material endings (parasol), to hearing the universe's completions. The blizzard forces crystallization when ice traps them. Cost is visible in her extended stay and physical transformation, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure from physical cold to memory's "dull ache" to the revelation that her "always" belongs to the land, with the burned letter forcing confrontation. The cost registers in releasing "the physical weight" of the promise, though the internal resolution feels slightly neat for the emotional complexity established.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes crystallize early: preserve complexity versus singular truth. The prophet's approach escalates pressure effectively, and the Line Walker's use of the kinetic parapet to destabilize him creates meaningful reversal. The cost is legible—wisdom is preserved but the prophet's truth will still dominate the visible world.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—transmuting collective pain into meaning—develops through accumulating discoveries rather than reversals. Pressure builds as each photograph reveals more about the community's transformation. The cost becomes legible when descendants witness their ancestors' struggle, though the escalation could tighten further in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from private obsession to public testimony through the crystal's revelations. Elara's choice to climb and speak despite her reticent nature shows agency with cost. The janitor's awakening provides external validation of her risk.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from general searching to following markers to finding the "wrong" arrow that she trusts anyway, culminating in the videotape discovery. The morning vision's "echo still vibrated in her bones" provides the driving force. Cost appears in the final forgetting—she achieves her goal but cannot retain it, standing with "no memory of why she had come."

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from experiment to survival to preservation. The station's collapse forces immediate choice with clear cost. Agency manifests in Elara's decision to capture rather than flee, though additional tightening mid-story would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from medical finality to spiritual passage through Elara's intervention. The "skipping song" crisis creates genuine pressure requiring her decisive action with the vinyl. Cost manifests in Mr. Gable's peaceful surrender of life, though escalation could sharpen between recognition and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from academic curiosity to "desperate, personal need" through the weeks of painstaking reconstruction. The fragmentary projections create genuine obstacles requiring adaptation. The final revelation reframes the quest from finding a location to understanding a process, though the personal cost of this knowledge shift could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from passive grief to active quest to physical healing to diplomatic standoff. The tooth discovery tightens options into a single path forward. Cost manifests in Leo's broken arm and Aris's calculated risk. The final negotiation moment could use slightly more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation operates through accumulative deepening: from seeking silence, to finding the glass, to the meditative polishing that reveals its inner light. The pressure isn't external conflict but internal discovery that narrows her path forward. The cost is clear—she chooses a harder, quieter way over the village's conventional fire.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (transforming shame into bearable history) is clear, with meaningful deepening when Kael offers his parallel experience. However, the escalation relies heavily on symbolic exchange rather than active pressure, and Kael's arrival doesn't sufficiently tighten options - it offers comfort rather than forcing harder choices.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening—from collecting surface hopes to encountering the woman's profound hope that "solemnizes" courage rather than mourning loss. Cost is visible in Kaelen's realization that his collection method was flawed. Could strengthen with more immediate pressure in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from the Heart-Vine's sickness through Elara's failing hope to the arrival of the harvest moon that demands immediate action. The deepening occurs when the mechanical solution transforms into spiritual remembrance, foreclosing the tinkerer's usual path. The vine spinning golden stories represents visible transformation with clear cost—abandoning mechanical mastery for ancestral practice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each pattern element builds toward the starlight's recognition - "waiting for the faint starlight in the vial to brighten." The cost manifests in the decade spent condensing starlight now "dark, its purpose fulfilled." One meaningful deepening through the mother's death constellation adequately raises emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal obsession to land-wide consequence as Elara discovers the echo engine's true function. The pressure tightens through technical challenge, though more visceral cost during the repair work would strengthen the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear escalation from calm collection to misalignment crisis to forced acceptance, with the dominant stake (collecting vs. being consumed by grief) signaled early. The tightening occurs when her own dread contaminates the connection, forcing a costly choice between fighting or accepting. Cost is visible in the "thin, delicate lace of mineralized grief" she must now wear.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of containing grief within art is signaled early and tightens through the kettle's timeframe. Escalation occurs through textural deepening as Elara moves from abstract loss to the specific memory of Leo's touch, narrowing her artistic options from "not a lion" to the precise "cupped hand." The cost appears in accepting his absence while preserving what he taught, though agency could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through each camera click from spinning carousel to lovers to celebration, building pressure toward the final self-confrontation. The dominant stake—negotiating with one's ghost—tightens as each image sharpens her regret about misdirected ambition. Cost is visible in realizing she "missed everything that was ever beautiful."

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from professional survey to puzzle-solving to active resurrection, with each phase narrowing options. The sextant discovery triggers investigation, which reveals the hydraulic system, forcing a choice between documentation and transformation. Cost accumulates through physical effort and professional risk. The tension could sharpen further—the "hours tracing pipes" compresses what could be more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (making peace with the abandoned dream) is signaled early and deepens when the bear's presence forces Elara to literally offer up her old composition. Cost is visible when the notes transform into light and are absorbed. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as the bear's gentle intrusion reweights Elara's relationship to her dream.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—finding truth about the weaver's tapestry—escalates through discovery of the sundial, following its directions, and confronting his own image. Cost is visible in the "painful understanding" and the foreclosure of his seeking life. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tapestry reveals not universal truth but personal destiny.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from decoding a simple knot to reading reality's fabric, with Elara's years of failure creating accumulated pressure. The tightening occurs when "the world through the glass shifted"—a perceptual breakthrough that forecloses her old methods. Cost is visible in physical endurance (kneeling in snow) and temporal investment ("decades"), though the resolution could carry more immediate dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake of understanding healing deepens through accumulation: from Elias's method of conjuring essence, through shared silence, to the carpet thread revelation that reframes loss. Cost is visible in the Countess's decade of isolation and her husband's "final year of decline." Could benefit from slightly more pressure in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: discovery of truth → finding schematic → assembling key → discovering egg → months of failed prototypes → final connection. The cost manifests in "tears cutting clean paths" and the recognition that beauty exists only as "echo, not presence." One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    The internal conflict between Elara's inherited trauma and her drive to transform it provides consistent pressure, culminating in her choice to create rather than destroy. However, the stakes remain primarily internal without external resistance, and the "singular obsession" to prove scars can sing lacks concrete opposition or cost beyond the emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from following the hum to understanding the box requires cosmic patience, with each fountain visit deepening the puzzle. The seven-night vigil shows genuine cost through endurance. The release of memories creates irreversible transformation, though the mid-section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds from discovering the gear (dissonant intrusion) to the probe's arrival (active threat) to Elara's decisive intervention. The stakes—preserving the Garden's "troubling serenity" versus maintaining non-interference—create genuine tension. Cost is visible when she breaks her generational pattern, though the probe's transformation feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal—the spectral voice's cryptic guidance leads to the greenhouse where memory, migration, and understanding converge. The stakes deepen meaningfully when Eliran grasps "the shape of collective grief," though agency remains primarily receptive rather than actively contested.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from sensing dissonance to discovering the rake handle's inscriptions to making painstaking corrections. The stakes intensify as "small arguments bloomed into lasting feuds" and tides "lap with sharper spite," creating urgency. The cost manifests in Silas's consuming focus where "past and present merged" during corrections.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to uncovering "a gambit, a move of profound love and loss" through the tapestry decoding, with tension in matching "hues to symbols" and the pressure of "sensations" rising from walls. The dominant stake of discovering intentions tightens through each revelation, though more resistance during decoding would strengthen agency.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear - energy grid failure versus innovation. The constraint of the Blank Page creates genuine pressure. The escalation from safe prediction to revolutionary design works, though the transformation from 0.0001% to certainty happens too quickly to feel fully earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from passive listening to active searching to treasonous broadcasting, each step narrowing options. The dust's first story ("a leaf unfurling toward the sun") marks the decisive turn, though middle pressure could tighten further between discovery and success.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—crystallizing the emotion of love and loss—tightens through the rocking chair's slowing rhythm and Elara's growing understanding of her own deception. The final blow that obscures the portrait is driven by protagonist agency with visible cost: "The face was now obscured."

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving truth versus accepting sanctioned history—escalates through Elias's discovery, with the chronometer providing concrete evidence that forces him to choose. The vertical descent creates natural pressure as each layer reveals contradictory evidence. However, the resolution lacks immediate opposition; the cost of his choice (continued exile, potential persecution) remains implied rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from program cancellation through Leo's resistance to final harmonic achievement, with clear tightening as Eliza strips away voices to isolate problems. Cost is legible in accepting the program's end while creating "fleeting, perfect" proof, though middle pressure could intensify beyond technical instruction.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal hollowness through restoration work to the time-pressured celestial alignment, culminating in Elara's choice to share rather than hoard the fruit. The cost is visible in her "devotion that bordered on obsession" and the risk of serving untested food. However, the customer transformations lack genuine conflict - everyone achieves perfect insight without struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    The city lights versus food dilemma creates genuine stakes with clear trade-offs. Escalation works through discovery (riddle → battery → forced choice) with visible cost when Arawn sacrifices the city's immediate power needs. The single lantern image effectively captures the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through deepening understanding—from observation to discovery of the seeding method to active participation in consecration. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each discovered object adds weight to Elara's eventual choice, with cost visible in her physical commitment to the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate from maintaining stasis to freeing the imprisoned creator, with each revelation tightening options—from telepathic scream to external contact to the ampoule discovery.

One meaningful deepening through cascading revelations that reweight his purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking "a flaw" to "redirecting" motion to the climactic calculated risk of the one-thousandth step maneuver.

Cost is legible in the "terrifyingly daring maneuver" with potential "fall into nothingness."

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from artistic stagnation to the broader question of whether human connection persists across time. The brush's activation escalates pressure, forcing Elara from passive hope to active creation. The woman's return with the crocus provides meaningful closure, though the conflict lacks a mid-story tightening that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from artifact preservation to city survival to cultural continuity. The frozen valve provides concrete obstacle with genuine risk ("agonizing process"). Cost is visible in Elara's physical struggle and the final acknowledgment of loss, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once she reaches the valve.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal defiance to cosmic consequence as Eliran's mechanism succeeds catastrophically. The ticking pressure of the returning tide creates urgency, and the reversal—achieving his goal only to find emptiness—lands with devastating irony and visible cost in the oxygen unraveling.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: survival after resuscitation → understanding the curse → three paradoxical confessions that progressively weaken the fear-form. Each note shows agency and raises cost (exposing his broken self-image, emptiness, fragility). The final paradox about strength/breath creates the decisive victory with clear on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from atmospheric unease to full storm assault, with Kaelen's response intensifying from careful taps to "frantic grace." The dominant stake - survival through transformation - tightens as the storm hits. Cost is visible in physical exhaustion and the risk to his floating world. Agency drives resolution through musical intervention rather than passive endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (city's survival) signaled early and tightens through resource depletion to structural failure. The crack transforms from catastrophe to opportunity through Elara's agency. Escalation follows causal lens with the whistle action foreclosing the wandering path with visible cost—the city now committed to an unknown destination.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (uncovering suppressed truth) escalates from solitary authentication to collaborative exposure, with Aris's decision to partner forcing him to abandon his emotional armor. The anonymous note creates effective complication without resolution. However, the opposition remains largely abstract (the "state," "they") without concrete antagonistic pressure in scene, limiting the felt resistance to their mission.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from private ritual to shared understanding as Elara's arrival forces Ansel to choose between maintaining secrecy or revealing his true purpose. The escalation from "measuring the slow, crumbling erosion" to actively "shoring up the past" creates meaningful pressure. Cost manifests in Ansel's vulnerability—his "stoicism faltered"—though the resolution leans slightly toward mutual understanding without sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding truth behind sanitized history) is signaled early and tightens when initial search fails. The reversal from "dead end" to reinterpreting the stamp as key shows protagonist agency. However, the resolution lacks immediate dramatic cost - we understand the conceptual implications but don't feel the price of this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes deepen from personal grief to soul-sacrifice, with the Keeper's warning creating meaningful tightening. The cost ("piece of your soul, not just your sleep") is explicit and paid through the transformation sequence. Agency drives every beat through Leo's deliberate crafting choices.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds from internal frustration through awakening to active hunting for the "quietest place," with Kaelen's agency driving each transition.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from decoding an abstract phrase to understanding planetary disconnection, with the telescope's unexpected behavior creating a meaningful reversal. The cost becomes legible when Elara must "teach them how to listen"—a burden she didn't seek. Pressure could tighten further through more concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from quelling client's obsession to confronting personal guilt, with the watch hand forcing the moment of truth. The confession forecloses Elara's livelihood with visible cost in the client's devastation. Pressure coheres through accumulated guilt from touching carved evidence. Slight deduction for the watch hand's purpose feeling somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on Elara's need to transform guilt into wisdom through this personal exchange. The moon's brief illumination creates temporal pressure, and Kael's shame that "mirrored her own" deepens the emotional cost. However, the actual exchange lacks dramatic tension—no real obstacles threaten the resolution once they meet.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: from scorning pole navigation to accepting it, each pole becoming "a short, achievable goal" that reweights his entire navigational philosophy. The dominant stake—proving he can move with purpose—tightens as he discovers purpose in smallness rather than grandeur. Cost is visible in abandoning celestial navigation for "ugly, functional forms," though the conflict could push harder against his resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from abstract quest to concrete life-or-death as Elara must choose between pursuing the mystery of the baseball or saving the trapped geologist.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reforging the severed bond—escalates from gathering spices to memory-conjuring to timeline alteration, with each step narrowing Alaric's options.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through Elara's reading progression from silence to vision to personal revelation, with the memory of hand-tracing serving as the key that redirects her search.

    Stakes escalate from personal quest to prophetic fulfillment as the old woman reveals Elara's role. The release of bugs shows agency with visible cost—her last possession given. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens but the volcano's calming feels slightly convenient despite thematic fit.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal risk (Lysander's treachery accusation) to systemic change (silent revolution), with Vorlag's arrival creating immediate pressure. The protagonist's agency drives the resolution through his calculated reveal of the sun-steel. However, the revolution's success feels somewhat predetermined; the "sleeper agents" awakening lacks visible resistance or cost that would deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clear escalation from ritual preparation to energy channeling to system overload, with Kael's agency driving each stage. The dominant stake—keeping his promise to understand—faces its ultimate test when he must choose between self-preservation and completion. Cost is visceral: "It did not burn; it unraveled him."

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal risk (minder's absence) through technical challenge (power outage) to philosophical revelation, with the timer's relentless clicking providing pressure. The cost is visible in Elara's transgression and the permanent evidence she creates, though the internal resolution feels slightly too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (solving the cipher to find lost knowledge) escalates through the duel's increasing precision requirements, culminating in the forty-five-degree angle that unlocks the solution. Cost is visible when Valerius chooses collaboration over victory. Minor deduction as the opposition between characters could have generated more friction before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal shelter-seeking to systemic resistance as the discovered poem transforms book-sorting into revolutionary action. The cost manifests in Silas's impending molt becoming evolution rather than escape, with his vagrant invisibility weaponized for the cause.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal longing to station-wide crisis when "no one could depart." Elara's agency drives resolution through artistic interpretation of the flicker code. The cost manifests in abandoning her "wistful refrains" for "harsh...atonality," though the external stakes could pressure her personal arc more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.9)
    The monsoon deadline creates coherent pressure that forces Elara's paradigm shift from measurement to faith. Her agency drives the transformation through active choice (awakening vs planting). The cost—abandoning her empirical framework—is legible when she "focused not on data, but on the stories."

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - finding expression for unspoken apologies - intensifies through the compass exercise where "cerulean regret" threatens to overwhelm before diffusing into acceptance. The tightening occurs when Kaelen must follow the lace's instructions to avoid drowning in memory. Cost is visible in accepting he'll never speak the words directly. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

No antagonist is needed; escalation tracks under the accumulative/textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: fulfill the Maestro’s last act and risk reconfiguring the hall’s foundations. Escalation tracks through density and cadence: from cipher’s reveal to embodied performance and the building’s groan.

    The dominant stake—opening Leo to wonder—tightens via the eclipse’s progress to totality.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)

Slightly soft mid-beat escalation, but the final choice carries unmistakable price.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—answer the hush—tightens through a single decisive intensification: the pure tone keyed to the space unbinds echoes.

Within the chosen lens, escalation is sufficient and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can she realize “fusion” given her incapacity—tightens via the shift from sterile lab attempts to the grotto’s mixed feelings and the decision to embrace a half truth.

A slightly stronger mid‑scene complication could have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on recognition and human connection, but pressure is gentle and largely unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—belonging vs. sacrilege/forgetting—are legible, with a meaningful tightening via the missing final tag and the return to the arbor’s interior.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (save the city’s temporal resonance vs lose the last link to her past) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully at the Warden’s demand.

One more on‑page complication prior to the Warden’s reveal could have sharpened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres internally: the need to solve ambiguous loss tightens into a single decisive intensification via the glass eyes’ binocular overlay. The price—abandoning reductionist quantification—reads on the page and reweights the stake. External antagonism is minimal, but under this lens the deepening is sufficient. Slight softness in felt risk keeps it just short of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: reveal or conceal under a tightening clock as power returns. Escalation arrives via the fragment’s psychic pull and the lights’ flicker, forcing a timely choice.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to truly understand plant behavior—tightens when Aris renounces control mid‑storm, foreclosing his prior methodology.

Still, agency drives the turn and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused—protect the cave’s power from theft/corruption—and pressure rises credibly when harmony becomes shriek and shadows physically converge.

The visible price is chiefly danger and a shaken confidence in her sight; no substantial loss narrows options after. Still, the tightening is meaningful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are coherent and signaled early—win belief and restore a suppressed history—and pressure tightens when the memorial reframes the disaster as sabotage.

The crowd’s swift alignment reduces resistance and diminishes felt jeopardy. Still, the turn meaningfully deepens the conflict from private conviction to public claim.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (dare to abandon ordered life to reach the fortress) are signaled early and cohere. Escalation occurs through density and one meaningful tightening: choosing and keying the largest portal. The price—forsaking her mapped life for a boundless, demanding library—is present but not sharply felt in the moment, given the unopposed path. A single complication or reversal would have clarified cost under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving/translating a non‑human emotional symphony—tightens toward the final night of migration.

The cadence shift lands, though the risk of interfering is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and legible: escape to pursue the aftermath of farewell. Pressure coheres and tightens once—storm → corridor → shard heats → focused push—and culminates in the unraveling. The price (losing the shard and risking psyche against impossible spirals) is present but lightly felt; no major reversal tests commitment. Still, agency drives the turn under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes—reconciling a lifetime of perceived deceit with a new survival narrative—intensify after the discovery. The meaningful tightening occurs at the reveal, narrowing options to a costlier grief and a private complicity (pocketed documents). External pressure is light but present (the director’s call), with internal conflict carrying the weight credibly at this scale. The resolution derives from her altered stance rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single live stake: extract textures before the hum steadies; escalation arrives via intensifying refractions and the encroaching dawn. The decisive tightening is the grid settling—options collapse and the ritual must end. Cost is present but subtle: surrender of access, bodily stiffness, and acceptance of what’s captured vs. lost. The conflict is internal/ritualistic rather than adversarial, which the piece executes well within its lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres from curiosity to peril: discovery of the empty bunk and label → office confrontation → explicit warning. The dominant stake is his commitment to witness in the face of institutional threat, and it tightens once; he chooses endurance over exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—decode the Signal and decide what to do with it—is clear from the outset. Pressure tightens when the hum becomes a presence and redefines the Signal as an emotional archive, forcing her stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—steering gentrification—is established early, with “survey tomorrow” tightening the thread. The escalation is a quiet deepening: the seventh mural elicits community action, producing a concrete hybrid proposal.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capturing the last pristine hush—is signaled early and tightened by the 17‑minute chemical timer and the dawning schedule of corporate landers. The decisive beats (triggering the reaction; taking the photo; choosing to witness the end) narrow options without melodrama. Cost is legible as the forfeiture of unspoiled silence and a foreclosed future. The conflict is quiet but credible and escalates coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (guidance before departure) is clear, and the harbor clang tightens pressure at the midpoint. Escalation comes via her interpretive breakthrough and decision to patch programming, not repair optics. The cost remains subtle—largely time and risk of conceptual pivot—rather than a visible sacrifice. Still, agency under pressure is evident and resolves the conflict credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake (truth of the source) tightens when the condensation becomes a map and forces a choice to cross the ice.

The pressure is coherent and builds in a single, decisive intensification appropriate to the length.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (prevent unmaking) is signaled early and tightens at the central square where imbalance is profound. Escalation is accumulative: pattern density increases until echoes appear and the archway halts collapse. The price is primarily conceptual/temporal rather than a concrete sacrifice or reversal on the page. Still, agency drives the turn and the pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (survival vs. securing the ephemeral) tightens meaningfully when the guardian charges and the oxygen alarm sounds. The reversal—choosing surrender over combat—narrows options and forecloses a path with visible risk. External and internal pressures interweave coherently under a causal lens. Costs are legible but not brutal; the price is more conceptual/moral than bodily.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (achieve hush/escape spectral pressure) is legible early, and escalation tightens with the Warden’s hum and approach. The decisive turn—using the lattice as filter to voice hard truths—narrows options and exacts a price (breaking the family’s protective silence). The clock about bodies doesn’t escalate the scene’s beat, but internal/external pressures interlock well. Resolution arises from his agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—release the ghost/restore the grove—is established early and tightens when the bead triggers the ballroom memory, reweighting the task from saving trees to granting release. The culminating choice has a visible cost and transforms the situation. Tension scales smoothly without redundancies; a single decisive intensification suffices. Slightly more on‑page risk or potential refusal would heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (rebuild precedent vs. reweave reverence) are clear, and escalation accrues via ritual repetition culminating in the heart-basin. Opposition is mostly conceptual or historical; little direct pushback surfaces on the page. The decisive deepening—sewing new quartz veins, awakening the labyrinth—feels earned, with a modestly legible price in effort and social risk. Tension is contemplative, not taut.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure accrues gently: the missing gnomon undercuts the apparent solution and forces a reframing through attention rather than force. The tightening is clear (she cannot “fix” the past; she must reinterpret), but the cost stays largely conceptual. One more on‑page trade‑off or loss would heighten stakes. Still, agency drives the turn via deliberate observation and renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—crafting and dispatching a new identity with human texture—remains coherent, with one tightening beat when Kael extracts the “margins” and seals the envelope. Escalation is modest; no substantive reversal or narrowing of options beyond the completion deadline implied by cleaners/morning. The cost lands as elegiac erasure and self‑anonymization rather than acute risk. Quiet, earned, but not high‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (thwart the coup without exposure) is clear and tightens when Elara forbids the direct chart and prescribes a desynchronizing gambit. The shift from confrontation to manipulating a weak link is a meaningful deepening that narrows options credibly. The price remains mostly conceptual on the page, but tension is sustained. No contrivance or coincidence resolves the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around whether understanding can substitute for decision, tightening as the spirits fall silent and the messages appear. Agency is clear at the ritual pivot (evoking on the glass), narrowing options to an inner acceptance with visible cost. The escalation is a decisive intensification consistent with the accumulative lens. Stakes remain focused and grow appropriately to the quiet climax.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—relief from PTSD—tightens through the experimental procedure whose plan and risks are set by Elara’s earlier choices. Pressure escalates texturally rather than through reversals; the memory beats deepen the cost and need more than they narrow options. The ending’s price (old wound persists, reweighted) is clear, but the on‑page present‑tense pressure is gentle. Effective, not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is personal: will she find a path back to joy. Escalation is modest but coherent—fog resistance, craft difficulty, the mid‑scene knowledge pivot, and the renunciation of her original plan. The felt price is chiefly effort and the acceptance of impermanence. Pressure is quiet; one sharper trade‑off or visible loss would raise the band.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure builds coherently through nested discoveries, with the method’s constraints shaping tactics. Stakes remain primarily conceptual (curiosity vs. certainty), so on‑page cost is gentle, not biting. The decisive tightening at the dome is strong—timed light, crystal, and nickel culminate in a single note. Absence of antagonistic pressure keeps intensity modest but appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—protect the clandestine language from seizure—is clear and escalates with the dawn deadline and the agents’ arrival. The turn is protagonist‑driven: Elara chooses a high‑risk, irreversible tactic that forecloses the old system of meaning. The price is conceptual rather than bodily, but it’s felt. Pressure remains coherent and tight under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—resolve the planet’s dissonance and clarify purpose—is signaled early and tightens as the lullaby introduces a concrete path that requires action. The escalation is a deepening of pattern rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens, culminating in the carving that forecloses the old “describe pain only” path. Cost is present but quiet (spent stamina, surrender of insomnia’s vigil). Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is established early and escalates via the widening crack and dulling petals. The tactical tightening is single but meaningful: she risks herself by inhaling the mist to light from within. Cost is felt but mild; the solution arrives cleanly once the legend is invoked, with limited resistance or tradeoff beyond urgency. A complicating setback in the retrieval or performance could deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are clear (finish together or lose the relationship), and pressure coheres, but escalation is subtle: the primary tightening arrives at the light‑through‑flaw discovery. The agency beat (her “carefully reckless” tilt) credibly triggers the turn. The cost side is more implied than pressed, so tension never quite bites. Still, the knowledge shift narrows options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is legible early (preserve history vs prevent catastrophe), and pressure tightens with the envelope’s hidden code and the mountain’s breath timer. Isla’s agency drives the deepening (reframing lower chambers as counterweight; designing the bypass). However, the Council’s swift acquiescence mutes the price and the sense of risk in the final turn, limiting escalation’s bite. Tension works beat to beat but resolves too cleanly for maximal force.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (safety vs. letting the song “fly”) tighten credibly when the folio reframes her mission. The decisive escalation is her choice to risk exposure and Argos; the cost is felt though quiet. Pressure is coherent with the accumulative lens, culminating in the release. A hair more friction or resistance in the final beat could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (crossing the sacred threshold to confront the origin) tightens from hesitation to decisive entry. The key deepening is her decoding of the grain, which reweights options and narrows to one meaningful risk. The storm-memory sequence delivers a visible price (terror, exposure to the defining trauma) and confirms the stakes. Resolution flows from her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (find a luminous, meaning-bearing rhythm) tightens when instruments fail, forcing a tactic change that deepens knowledge and reframes the goal. Agency drives the turn (the bypass), and the transmission is a culminating action. The price is present but soft (fatigue, isolation, risk of using a dormant beacon). One more concrete loss or constrained option would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (find why paths disappear), and pressure tightens through a single clear deepening: the seed test reframes the problem. The price—knowledge without remedy—lands, though escalation remains contemplative rather than tensile. Coincidence initiates the turn, but resolution depends on Finn’s decision to test and then to document. A touch more on-page friction or risk during the experiment would elevate urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—manufacture a perfect “accident” without exposure—is clear early and tightens as the tide recedes and the object arcs toward the family. The lever click and airborne beat provide the decisive intensification. The price is subtle (choosing anonymity) rather than visceral; risk is implied rather than felt through near-failure. Still, escalation tracks under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming forbidden tides via self-inscription—is signaled early and tightens through endurance and the decisive application of the moonstone ink. The deepening is clear when the “key” shifts the meaning of her act. Costs include pain, exertion, and permanent defiance under a ban. Pressure is primarily internal; absence of present-tense external push keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (recovering purpose) is signaled early and tightens via the ripple epiphany. The escalation is quiet but decisive, consistent with the accumulative lens. Agency drives resolution—he reinterprets method and finishes the work. The price is internal (accepting craft as resonance rather than illustration) and could feel sharper, but it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to carry pain—tightens meaningfully when he opens the box and confronts the tooth/hair, culminating in the resolve to speak to recruits. Escalation is modest but steady under the accumulative lens, with one clear deepening. The cost is enduring public exposure to his scars and story; no luck or offstage fix. Internal and external threads interweave credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes remain internal—deriving conditions for hope—and escalate via density and pattern: observation → trial balloons → parallel-timeline convergence → inscription and release. The key tightening is the unique light-shadow meeting that unlocks her model. Prices are implied rather than dramatized; no option is starkly foreclosed. Still, the cadence shift at the breakthrough reads earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain a quiet mapper or become a witness—tightens as the wall’s scream reframes her role. The discovery sequence escalates pressure credibly; choosing to share the negative publicly carries a felt cost. Opposition is largely internal, but coherent under the chosen lens. A single meaningful deepening lands.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens meaningfully as the first bell strikes; pressure escalates through vibration against her concentration. The heartbeat sacrifice forecloses an option (keeping herself whole) to stabilize the mirage, and the window-aiming choice converts intent into public consequence. Stakes remain intimate but felt; the price is clear and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear—securing a ceasefire—and pressure tightens via the ritual procedure culminating in the handshake. The cost is internal and systemic rather than spectacle, which fits the lens, though on‑page resistance from delegates is minimal. The final hesitation before handclasp provides a credible micro‑turn. The resolution is earned by her endurance and method, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear: keep curatorial control or surrender it. Escalation is coherent—thunder → first drops → downpour—forcing stance crystallization, with the loss of the egg as visible price. The external complication (rain) does not resolve the conflict; his agency does. The tightening forecloses his prior ritual and profiteering self‑myth in one irretrievable move.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: end the lullaby engine. Pressure coheres and deepens as each thread carries pain and consequence, culminating in the personal cost of the final silver strand. Escalation is driven by her agency rather than coincidence. Stakes remain mostly internal, but the felt cost is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to tell truth ethically—tightens from contemplation to a public, risky act. The irreversible choice (shredding her work, stepping on stage) provides clear cost and narrowing of options. Internal and external pressures interlock without melodrama. Escalation is concise but sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—honoring a vanishing passage—tightens when the cadence is broken and Silas redefines his signal into a memorial. The cost is a renunciation: he accepts impermanence and foregoes rebuilding; the butterflies’ non‑compliance tests his original aim. Escalation is primarily tonal and thematic, apt for the chosen lens. A slightly clearer on‑page trade‑off under time pressure could lift it further.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and pressure coheres: the card threatens to crumble, the wax won’t take impressions, despair rises. The meaningful tightening arrives with the rope reconfiguration, a knowledge-deepening that changes options. Agency drives the resolution. The felt price is there but light; few alternatives are foreclosed beyond the near-failure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake—recovering/clarifying purpose under imminent storm pressure—tightens to the decisive act of breaking the seal. The escalation is coherent: barometric warnings → dream fixation → manipulation → snap → revelation. The cost is conceptual but legible, with a tactile proxy (“a tiny death”) that forecloses the old path. The resolution derives from the protagonist’s agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: opening the covenant. The failures via different logical sequences tighten options until surrender becomes the only viable move. The price—renouncing the comfort of quantification—registers at the climax. It’s a quiet arc, but the cadence shift is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are signaled early (catastrophic transition) and escalate through the confrontation and Kael’s hand to the sword. The key tightening is Lyra reframing the flaw as part of the story, forcing Kael to trade resentment for responsibility. The price is internal but legible and proportional to the scene’s scale. A touch more tangible jeopardy could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: seize the dream or risk sanity; pressure tightens when the vision destabilizes and any “shaky breath” could shatter it. The turn to synchronized breathing is a decisive tactic shift that narrows options to stillness and precision. The price—abandoning measurement/control to harmonize—reads, though the pain of that trade is more elegant than visceral. Tension operates at image and beat scales without diffusion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres around the imminent demolition (“wreckers tomorrow”), tightened by Lyra’s intervention and the forced choice to act. The ribbon discovery reweights options and yields a non-confrontational tactic. The resolution’s external cost is modest; the Councillor yields without counterpressure. Internal stakes and the relinquishment cost do much of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—break rules to seek forbidden knowledge—tightens once through the bathroom decision and culminates in a new mission. Internal and external pressures interweave, but external consequence remains mostly implied. The vision is a strong deepening beat that changes options/knowledge under a causal lens. A clearer on‑page price paid would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (survive and reach the Library) is clear from Elara’s entry. Escalation tightens through the predator’s approach to the crossroads and Silas’s non‑combat choice that forecloses fighting as an option. Agency is strong; the breath imitation is a decisive, character‑specific action. The on‑page cost skews subtle (risk of exposure, renunciation of force) rather than a palpable wound or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—finding/recapturing Idris/the garden—tightens meaningfully when the journal reframes the quest from place to understanding. Agency drives the turn (reading, reinterpreting, choosing to remain), and the cost is a quiet renunciation. Pressure remains internal and artful but never quite bites; the search finds its answer without a tangible friction point beyond the descent/read choice. Strong deepening, light escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—stabilize reality—appears early and tightens as the room destabilizes and the door pulses. Escalation is a clear because/therefore progression to the tactile rebraiding. The price is largely implicit (risk, vertigo, strain), with no trade‑off or loss on the page. Tension is credible but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear (restore the caves’ peace), and tension tightens at the stone’s flare and during the guiding of energy along “paths of the ice-cracks.” Escalation is primarily density and cadence shift rather than overt reversals, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price (effort, responsibility) is felt but not punishing, keeping the pressure strong but gentle. Agency drives the turn; nothing resolves by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (rekindle the light/send a sign) is clear early and tightens through the hunt for the aberrant path and the on-page test of alignment. The beat of “nothing happens” before the hum creates a palpable tightening. Costs lean emotional/endurance rather than material, but the moment of potential failure credibly pressures the choice. Escalation remains coherent and earned under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—completing and interpreting the final record before the fog seals them—tightens as the hush deepens and the mist hardens. The meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from reading the world’s pillars to measuring her own shadow, foreclosing the path of future‑oriented identity. The cost (acceptance of unreadness and entombment) is felt and informs her refusal to light the lamp. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are coherent (piercing communal despair), and pressure deepens through a pattern of escalating effects. The discovery of “RISE” tightens intent and redirects the finale into a ground‑trace—a meaningful narrowing. Visible sacrifice is modest; there’s little pushback beyond inertia and silence. Still, the cadence shift at the end reweights cost and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—navigating a generational rift—tightens through the cicada‑triggered vision that deepens understanding and shifts tactics. The escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price is modest (pride yielded, approach altered) but legible. A sharper felt consequence would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—safety via constriction vs. openness—tightens as gravity reverses, forcing a stance under pressure. The decisive act (leaving the bunker, then gifting the doll) forecloses a path and exacts a price. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens, with a meaningful cadence shift at the trellis. A minor softness is that external risk is low; the tension is mostly internal but still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres: the hum intensifies, options narrow to a precise architectural node, and Elara acts to transform it. The decisive beat (palm strike) reweights the stake from abrasive noise to protective hush. However, the price paid remains largely aesthetic/philosophical rather than a felt loss or trade‑off on the page. A single complicating snag would have heightened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early and deepens with the orchard’s defense and the map’s ticking fade. The key tightening is the sudden, coherent pressure of the defense system and the later sunrise deadline. Costs are present but moderate—physical peril resolves once the fruit is taken. Still, agency drives the escalation and consequences alter options going forward.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—learning to breathe in chosen emptiness—is clearly signaled and escalates from suffocation to the painful test. The key tightening is Kael’s refusal to comfort, forcing the youth into cost-bearing agency at the knocker. Price and consequence are felt (burn, solitude) and reweight options without contrivance. No wasted turns or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—survive and discharge the accumulating pressure—is legibly escalated as facets slice fabric and the hum becomes a scream. The pivotal tightening is the volunteer decision that forecloses passive endurance. Agency drives resolution; coincidence does not rescue her. The price is palpable in risk and the gambit’s narrowness, even if material sacrifice is light.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are singular and legible: obtain the hidden truth, at the cost of binding guilt. Escalation is a decisive intensification under the chosen lens: silence → hiss → hum → confession; his continued cranking is an endurance choice that narrows options. The knowledge turn (“We built it on a lie”) reconfigures his status and future. Quiet but unmistakable pressure persists through the ending stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (liberation from guilt via possibility) is signaled early and tightens with the reality shift and the command to choose. The unsnapping is a concrete narrowing and a paid price, and the armor divestment seals the consequence. Tension is primarily internal and lyrical rather than adversarial, but it escalates coherently. The path is a shade smooth once the queen appears, limiting edge.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (whether his work can become more than penance) is present early and tightens with the letter’s content, shifting his stance. The meaningful turn is knowledge/deepening rather than external conflict, fitting the lens; cost is implicit in choosing to keep engaging sorrow while honoring light. Tension is quiet but steady, culminating in the decision to bind letter and button in the record. Slight softness in explicit price on the page keeps it in the low‑8s.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are established (surveillance and the value of the archive), and there’s one meaningful tightening when the map reorients him toward the lagoon. However, obstacles fall away with little resistance; the booth opens and yields the drive without complication. The price is largely deferred to future risk. Tension is steady but rarely sharpens into a hard trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early and pressure coheres: the prophecy escalates (“grew frantic”) prompting the tactic shift (pulling more sound away). The prism’s emergence and pulse mark a decisive intensification that narrows options to the single, pure note. Cost is present, though not crushing; the endurance model suits the scope. Tension works at sentence and beat scale without relying on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure deepens via pattern break and cadence shift: the ordinary sorting ritual is interrupted by the alien speck, then ritualized monuments trigger the flare. Stakes are primarily conceptual; opposition is minimal and the price of change remains gentle. Escalation is nonetheless legible and coheres under an accumulative lens. The decisive turn originates in her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (control vs. uncertainty) tightens via environmental pressure and the need to improvise under cold, numbing conditions. The meaningful deepening is the repair without a plan, which forecloses the old tactic of schematic certainty. Cost is legible though primarily internal; external danger augments but doesn’t escalate to peril. The escalation is clear and earned under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes concentrate on recovering truth/child against time and guilt, with a single tightening: the luminous path narrows options to the sealed furnace. The heavy door and the boy’s terror provide on‑page obstacles and prices. Agency drives escalation—Elara persuades elements, uses a whispered solvent, and chooses a measured, not sentimental, response. Resolution grows from her internal recalibration rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—freeing Kael from a shame loop—tightens from discomfort to confession to a decisive reweighing via joy. Escalation is primarily internal and method‑driven, with at least one meaningful turn at the memory of laughter. Resistance from Kael softens quickly after initial objection, slightly blunting pressure. Still, the choice to recast and “capture laughter” under time‑like pressure of a forming memory reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—agency vs. control in service of “mercy”—is signaled early and tightens when the mask’s surveillance function is revealed. Escalation is internal but coherent: pain → equilibrium panic → tactical focus → strap removal, which narrows options and invites retaliation risk. The price (physical agony, loss of monitored “safety,” defying captors) is felt, and the new variable deepens rather than resolves. A single strong tightening rather than multiple reversals suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is clear (retrieve truth to honor erased histories), with one meaningful tightening when the lens reveals the chimney brick. Pressure is gentle: minimal resistance or alternative costs; discovery proceeds smoothly once the tool is acquired. The emotional price is commitment, not sacrifice, so escalation feels elegant rather than urgent. Still, the reveal deepens options and leads to decisive retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (whether to engage and witness) tightens as discovery reweights the moral calculus. The decisive turn—speaking to the girl and promising testimony—forecloses his prior stance. Cost is emotional and principled, not merely procedural. Pressure escalates once, appropriately for the length, via the vision that reconfigures stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—breaking sterile eternity to compress it into a living moment—is pressured by the whisper’s destabilization and the singular frost window. The meaningful tightening is the decision to introduce a flaw and trigger a rupture; the “crack” forecloses the prior path. Cost is legible on the page in the system’s reconfiguration and loss of static perfection. A touch more jeopardy around failure would raise the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (prove a civilization’s nature) is signaled early, and pressure coheres through the storm ritual into a revelation that alters options. The tightening centers on removing the present self (mirror‑covering) to read the artifact’s intent—a clear deepening with cost. External antagonism is offstage, but the internal conflict and philosophical stakes carry. The ending’s solitude is an unmistakable price.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake is signaled early and tightens when Silas’s betrayal triggers Elian’s debilitating truth‑revulsion, foreclosing confrontation. Escalation is driven by Elian’s agency—choosing creation over direct opposition—and the choice carries a visible cost (physical weakening, risking societal unraveling). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length. The price is more conceptual than visceral, but it’s on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (seeking the place beyond explanation) tightens meaningfully: needle’s stillness and downward point forces the plunge decision. The price is clear: physical danger, surrender of the tool and his habitual collecting. Pressure is primarily internal/situational but coheres and intensifies to the renunciation. Antagonism is minimal, yet one decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stake—preventing the seam from closing—tightens via the slide’s warning and the storm’s urgency. A meaningful turn occurs when she reconceives fracture lines as a diagram and commits to building the buttress. The temporary “nothing happens” beat before the wood lights adds a small test of commitment. Cost remains light; the success arrives without a trade‑off beyond exertion and future obligation.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (answer the nocturnal bloom/emptiness) escalates from inquiry to test to revealed pattern, with her agency at the open and close. The tightening arrives at the beam/etching discovery, reweighting her options from repair to reinvention. Cost is primarily internal and conceptual; tangible loss or refusal is light. Pressure remains coherent and grows under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake—extracting and honoring truth—tightens through a decisive deepening when the lagoon answers and the parley reshapes options. The retrocognitive seizure raises cost and urgency; the horn adds a soft time pressure. The price is primarily ethical and emotional rather than physical, but it’s legible and binds her future. A slightly sharper on‑page sacrifice would have elevated the escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reviving the town’s living spirit—is established early and tightens when “open it” is rejected in favor of “connect.” The decisive deepening is the catalyst insight, leading to the town‑square reading that changes options and produces visible effects. Pressure is gentle; opposition is mostly conceptual, and the price is acceptance of limits rather than a concrete loss. Still, escalation reads cleanly under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are clear early (archive the silence) and tighten decisively when the phrase fractures into a prophecy, reweighting every subsequent move. The reversal from preservation to destruction narrows options and imposes a moral price (oath-breaking vs. potential catastrophe). The garden’s tonal shift from velvet disquiet to blade-like dread escalates pressure without gimmickry. Consequences remain live even with an open final pose.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake—reopen the vortex to return life—tightens as he shifts from adding power to subtracting disorder. The resistance (“a law of nature fighting itself”) provides friction; the key turn is the choice to plant rather than enter. The visible price is understated but real: a renunciation of personal escape for stewardship. Escalation is clean and coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: whether to trigger an alarm. Escalation tightens via the wind’s sudden stillness, chaotic instruments, and the lever’s “pulse,” culminating in the rope’s vibration. The renunciation forecloses a live option with implied communal risk. The only limit is the absence of a second reversal or explicit loss, which isn’t required at this length but caps peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Orion will guard his private communion or risk it to reconfigure the station’s stance—tightens with the anomaly alert. Escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than multi-step pressure, appropriate for the lens but still low-voltage. The choice forecloses solitary use of the glass in favor of shared witnessing. The cost is felt but subtle; jeopardy remains conceptual more than perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes tighten when the new ghost’s gaze focuses pressure on the honey house, forcing Silas to search and decide how to honor the story. The decisive deepening comes with interpreting the panels and accepting stewardship; the price is ongoing responsibility and a chosen silence. The conflict remains low‑temperature but coherent and cumulative. One more concrete obstacle or competing demand could have sharpened cost further.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—being understood/marking time’s canvas—appears early and coheres. Pressure deepens through public indifference into a felt low, then breaks pattern with the woman’s focused approach, which reconfigures the stakes. The price is primarily emotional: risking exposure to indifference and almost forgetting the shard. Escalation is quiet but sufficient for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recasting loss into beauty—is signaled and tightened by the string’s snap. Escalation is quiet but present: from discovery (feather) to rupture (snap) to deliberate re‑making with an irrevocable trade‑off (no more flight). Agency drives the turn; the price (functional loss) is explicit. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens without relying on coincidence to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (achieve communion before death) are signaled early, with pressure tightening through time passage and bodily decline. The pivotal deepening arrives when intention is sent and the lithicores answer, reweighting options and costs. Tension is serene rather than combative, but the persistent clock and physical attrition lend credible pressure. One meaningful tightening suffices under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can she reconcile scientific rigor with the ritual’s internal effects—tightens through the discovery of the amber and the circle’s placid pressure. The key deepening is the realization that the tower is inert and the path is the intervention, narrowing interpretive options. The price is internal (cracking her one constant) rather than external, but it’s legible and consequential. Escalation remains coherent and culminates in a stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—coaxing life from a poisoned battlefield—is legible and tightens when the lark’s call triggers “It was time.” The ritual of speaking the land’s poison into air provides the key deepening; the seed’s click seals it. Price and narrowing are more tonal than tactical, but they’re felt. A stronger on-page cost (risk or sacrifice) could raise it.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure escalates through problem-solving beats with one meaningful tightening (hidden compartment revelation). The dominant stake remains personal and focused, but opposition is low and risk stays mostly conceptual. The new knowledge narrows tactics, yet we do not witness a price paid beyond intention. Effective, not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—purpose vs. psychic erosion—is signaled early and tightens when the applique’s glint redirects attention to the cosmos’ hidden ribbon. The escalation is a deepening of options/knowledge that forecloses the old coping tactic (nostalgic drawings) in favor of riskier forward-looking mapping. Cost is the acceptance of a future unmoored from home; pressure remains coherent and grows to the closing beat. It’s primarily internal but not static.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is early and coherent: restore balance to the sky. Pressure tightens when the keeper denies simple theft and forces a value test, prompting the trade with real cost. Escalation is modest but clean, with agency driving the turn rather than luck. Stakes remain personal yet scaled to the sky, avoiding telescopic inflation.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain a recorder or intervene under political danger—is signaled and tightened by the boy’s presence. The escalation is a focused deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate to length. The price is clear enough: exposure and redefinition of her mission; the discarded uniform becomes a charged token of risk. Tension operates at sentence and beat scales without deflation.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around enduring pain versus risking deeper exposure to find translation; the feather tactic is a meaningful tightening that changes options. The price is explicit: the visions persist and must be borne with new grammar, not erased. While no external antagonist presses back, internal and environmental pressures escalate sufficiently at this length. The ending choice (ritualized feather-to-stone) crystallizes commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres as the fraying thread compels decoding, with the thunder’s incremental growth functioning as a tightening cadence. The keystone choice is protagonist-driven and resolves the village’s stasis and his internal stalemate. The legible price is primarily internal; the external risk feels low, so escalation reads refined rather than perilous. Still, the narrowing of options and decisive act are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—upending a monolithic ritual in favor of multifaceted understanding—is signaled early and tightens when the High Speaker freezes and Kaelen seizes his one opening. The reversal from hush to communal chorus is clear, and his invitation forces a public stance. Costs are more conceptual/social than personal; visible sanction or backlash is muted, so pressure never bites hard. Nevertheless, escalation coheres and resolves by protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens when the random “stellar” pattern reframes as mechanical, narrowing options to a single risky act. The choice to bind the weapon to the wound forecloses the safer path of mere restoration and costs the keepsake. Pressure coheres from interior need to external act, with one clean intensification sufficient at this length. No reliance on coincidence to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure is internal but coherent: the life of safe repetition versus the risk of reengaging a buried promise. Escalation tightens through discovery and memory, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses a path. The price is present but quiet, more elegiac than acute. Slight softness in external friction keeps tension below peak.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (warn the fleet/prove whisper over shout) is clear early and tightens through the infusion/recork/release sequence. A meaningful pressure bump arrives at the delay before the boats turn, testing his commitment. Resolution follows from Elias’s chosen method, not coincidence. The price is primarily internal; external cost is muted but sufficient for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular and legible: send the archive or let it die with the station. Pressure tightens when the hydraulics and power limits foreclose standard options, forcing a costly improvisation. The accelerated schedule and total power drain make the price unmistakable. Resolution arises from her agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (psychic quiet) is engaged early and tightened by the eye’s promise vs. cost. The key turn is the recognition of the eye’s trap and the subsequent choice to use it as a tool, not a refuge. The storm beat escalates coherently and forces stance crystallization. Price is explicit: accepting an “endless scream” in doses to build true resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—decoding the gesture—is present early and tightens through the ritualized waiting. Escalation arrives via a meaningful pattern break (the woman), consistent with the accumulative lens. The resolution is earned more by persistence and reframing than by protagonist-driven reversal, keeping cost subtle. The felt price is mostly in renunciation rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding/being guided by the doorway—is clear, and pressure coheres under a causal lens with one meaningful tightening (trusting ants into a hidden, dangerous passage). External danger (rising water, fissure, tunnel) is present but underplayed, keeping the felt price modest. Resolution stems from her agency, not coincidence, though conflict never truly bites back. The cadence shift at the doorway is earned but low on visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure tightens credibly from dread to the risk of entering the grotto to allowing the starlight to touch her. The decisive deepening—reframing “attack” as “communion”—narrows options and forecloses her earlier stance. Costs remain more conceptual than visceral, which slightly softens the pinch. Still, the dominant stake (soul-level understanding) is tested and transformed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates from “hollow output” to a make-or-break method pivot. The tightening occurs at the whisper and is resolved by Lyra’s agency; coincidence doesn’t solve it. The price—abandoning the cage model for a growth pattern—is present but underlined more conceptually than viscerally. Still, the pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—meaning vs. despair—tightens as the dream logic invades waking space, forcing a stance. The decisive intensification is the flight, which reweights options and burns away jealousy. The resolution (to write differently) arises from her agency and forecloses a path without false reset. The price is internal and credible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering purpose—tightens when the mother’s deadline intrudes, forcing Elara to act rather than observe. The escalation fits the lens: density of motifs → situational pressure → decisive touch. The cost is quiet but legible: a renunciation of scent as primary map in favor of presence. A slightly didactic mentor speech softens tension, but the beat still turns on Elara’s agency.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are singular and coherent (fortitude rune or falter), and escalation arrives via the involuntary crystallization—an embodied obstacle—followed by the breath‑held intensification. The decisive tightening is her refusal to exhale until the rune is complete, trading comfort for focus. While quiet, the cost is legible and the cadence shift lands. No luck or external rescue resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—achieve forgiveness/peace—intensifies through the induced current sequence and the ghost’s violent shudder to a quiet, earned release. One meaningful tightening occurs when he turns to meet her eyes; her apology risks self-abasement and yields irreversible change (his dispersal). The live clock of dawn/saws quietly adds pressure without hijacking the intimate conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: unify all records into a single encompassing question under the pressure of the cosmic stutter. The hiccup provides a decisive tightening and the spiral walk escalates density and focus. Yet costs remain abstract; nothing is visibly lost or foreclosed beyond the conceptual reframing. Tension is steady rather than biting.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are clear and scale well: a single grain of dust vs. centuries of drift. Escalation tightens when the key is missing and Elara chooses a high‑risk manual synchronization—agency drives the turn. The price is mostly risk rather than a paid loss, which softens the peak. Still, the pressure coheres and deepens to a satisfying cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (how to respond to the intrusion and grief) is signaled early and coheres. Escalation occurs via insight turned into action (coding a new architecture), a credible tightening for this length. The felt price remains modest; the piece prioritizes reweighting over jeopardy, muting peak tension. Still, the shift forecloses the “stronger wall” path with a clear stance.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding her father—tightens as the clues shift her hypothesis from vice to penance. The meaningful deepening occurs when people he helped reframe the journey, culminating in the journal. The price is emotional rather than tactical; escalation is steady but mostly linear. A more acute choice under pressure would heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (whether he can transform wrong numbers into beginnings) are present and deepen, but pressure is gentle. The meaningful tightening arrives when he bridges two callers and, later, folds the final voice into an emergent “symphony.” Costs and foreclosed options remain largely internal and conceptual. The piece avoids coincidence as resolution, but lacks a sharp turn that narrows options with palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserve and, ultimately, deliver the weight of a small moment) is clear and tightens from archival recovery to personal handover. The emotional cost is legible in her self‑control and the mother’s recorded sacrifice. Escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than a combat of wills, appropriate for the lens and length. Minor softness remains from coincidence resolving the external need.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—transmuting loneliness into connection—tightens when Elias recognizes Clara’s void and reframes the exchange as founding a museum. The turn forecloses a quieter path (remaining a lone “ghost” broker) and commits to a costlier role. Pressure is more interior than antagonistic, but the escalation is clear and character‑driven. Slight softness in on‑page resistance limits peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres and tightens as the chaotic hum resolves into a path and then into a painful silence and overwhelming contact. The principal cost is internal—absorption and the forfeiting of an externalized map—which lands but remains quiet. There is no adversarial force or hard reversal, yet the single deepening is sufficient for this length and lens. The needle’s permanent inward turn forecloses a prior way of working.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (extract meaning or remain lost) is clear and tightens through a methodological pivot and the blood‑pen beat that narrows options. Escalation is cognitive but tangible via resource cost and environmental pressure. The decisive turn is protagonist‑driven; coincidence complicates (lurch) but does not resolve. Slightly softer on visible loss; the tension remains largely intellectual.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: preserving/translating the harbor’s quiet. Escalation is clean—a singular modern noise demands a stance—and her response narrows options (she cannot remain purely observer). The price is subtle but present: she suspends her private art to intervene and risks exposure. The conflict could feature a slightly sharper consequence for her if ignored, but within scope it lands.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake—protecting the promise—and tightens once at the hidden door. The reversal is internal yet concrete: witness over possession, followed by erasing her own work, which forecloses discovery. Stakes are felt but largely inward; limited external resistance keeps the ceiling just shy of top band. The cost is nonetheless unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserving a shared love/memory—tightens during the absolute hush, forcing a risked deviation from therapy protocol. The escalation is driven by Elara’s choice of complex rhythm and culminates in a costly, ephemeral union that forecloses easy reconciliation. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly. The price—return to isolation with a fragile thread—lands on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres from the outset: cross‑maze traversal without tech, avoiding other patrols, and the boss’s searching approach. The key tightening is her decision to prove the whisper theory rather than reveal herself, which directly alters outcome. Still, the on‑page cost feels modest—no significant sacrifice beyond risk already assumed. Stakes are clear and focused but stop short of a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—holding back the formless gloom—is legible and tested when the sun’s light fails. A meaningful tightening occurs as reflection unravels, forcing Elara to risk a new method and to confront the darkness with empathy before weaving stars. The price reads in patience and exposure rather than tangible loss, so danger feels slightly abstract. Nonetheless, escalation coheres and resolves via her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—community coherence under an oppressive edict—is clear, and pressure tightens when Elara arrives having been followed, prompting immediate, covert action. The plan’s execution escalates toward the dawn reveal. The price is felt conceptually (risk to all participants) but remains largely off‑page, softening the sense of paid cost. Still, the agency is Aris’s and the resolution is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs the safety of the known—is clear from the chest onward and tightens through the row and landing. The meaningful turn is the conscious detachment and final renunciation; cost is implied in abandoning Aethelburgh and his identity. Pressure remains primarily internal; there’s no credible counter‑force on the page to test commitment after the call, slightly muting escalation. Still, the cadence intensifies and resolves cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (how to hold grief) is clear; pressure coheres through the ritual’s suffocating stability. The stem’s crack is a decisive tightening that forces a trade‑off: maintain numbing ceremony or risk care. He chooses to stop carving (foreclosing one path) and weave a frail bird (embracing cost). Internal and external threads interlock without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether she can meet the Colonnade’s song without reducing it—tightens when she resists literal translation and chooses dissolution. Escalation reads as a deepening of resonance and surrender rather than a series of turns, apt for the chosen lens. The price (abandoning former poetics) is felt but not sharp; no external consequences test her stance. Still, the cadence shift around the “tremor of certainty” provides a clear peak.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to trade perspective for awakening—is clear and tightens at the handshake and the breath on the reed. The escalation is a single, effective deepening rather than a series of reversals, fitting the length and lens. The cost is legible (loss of exclusive perspective, acceptance of a strange path) and carries into her artistic future. Stakes could feel sharper if reluctance or risk tested her resolve a beat longer.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are internal but clear: make the pilgrimage truly move a listener. Escalation arrives when she abandons conducting for responsive presence, narrowing options to risk and receive. The unexpected laughter is a meaningful tightening/turn consistent with the accumulative method. Cost is felt but subtle, more conceptual vulnerability than concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—redeeming grief into meaningful craft—is present early and tightens as the coordinates lead to the observatory and the lens completes. Escalation is primarily internal via discovery and alignment rather than external pushback. The decisive deepening arrives at the indigo curtain’s illumination of grief as “fertile soil.” Cost is felt but subtle; the path offers little resistance beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to locate value and meaning through the concrete—tightens when Elara shifts from cards to leak, then to attic tracing. The meaningful turn is her choice to confide and enlist Gable, which enables the physical reverse‑engineering. Cost is modest but legible as she foregoes pure abstraction to confront the messy, wet fix.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (keep self vs. accept seductive erasure) is signaled early and tightens at the physical contact with the pagoda’s offer. The vision meaningfully deepens stakes and the refusal clearly forecloses the high-reward path with an on-page emotional price. Pressure stays coherent; only slight softness is the relatively quick reversal after the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (contain the pathogen vs the dream world) is legible early and pressure tightens from curiosity to existential risk once Aris feels the entity. The decisive escalation is her infection, converting preservation into containment with personal cost. Resolution is earned by her stance to bind it “for eternity.” A single, focused deepening rather than multiple reversals, appropriate for length.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear early (how to respond to betrayal without losing self) and deepen as he chooses care over rupture. The meaningful tightening occurs when he reframes method “by shedding layers” and commits via the tail‑tip ritual. The visible price is relinquishing the friend image and accepting risk in continued gentleness. Tension is more meditative than perilous, but it coheres and concentrates by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with the new scar—tightens through the tunnel and revelation that the miracle escaped her. The cost rises from physical pain to existential absence, culminating in a small but meaningful act (unwrapping) that risks confronting truth. Escalation is internal but coherent and cumulative; no soft reset. Slightly quiet on external pressure, yet the internal trade‑off is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres under an accumulative lens: density and resonance increase from tactile contact to immersive memory to action. Stakes remain intimate and conceptual, yet the decision to project functions as a tightening choice that transforms the stored love into a public goodbye. The lack of antagonistic force is offset by an effective cadence shift. The price is quiet but present: releasing what was held as an archive.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (freeing creativity) is clear early, and pressure accumulates toward the alignment ritual. Escalation is primarily density and cadence rather than narrowing options; success feels inevitable once she reaches the plain. The cost lands (exhaustion, bittersweet fragility), but a single on‑page tightening or reversal under stress is missing. Agency drives resolution, yet the conflict remains largely unopposed.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—prevent the screaming fragment from infecting the archive—tightens cleanly when the strand emerges and threatens spread. Elara’s choice of charm over force is a meaningful tactic, and the successful harmonization provides resolution. The price (mental strain, empathy expenditure, perpetual duty) is felt but lightly rendered on the page. One decisive intensification suffices at this length, though a sharper on‑page cost would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stakes (forest unraveling vs. preserving the biome/inner integrity) are clear, and the tightening occurs at the failing tree with a single decisive act and price paid. However, pressure is relatively soft; the mechanism yields without real resistance, and there’s minimal risk of failure. The price—giving up his last artifact—lands, but escalation would benefit from at least one contested beat before harmony is achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (crossing from fear toward active courage) is clear and coheres through the toll requirement. The key tightening is the price of passage—tell a fear—forcing specific vulnerability. Costs are primarily internal and lyric; no hard reversal, but pressure deepens appropriately for the scale. Resolution proceeds from Elara’s choice, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—safety vs. voice—tightens via the found handprint and the warming throat, culminating in “He would not remain.” The pressure escalates texturally: routine → anomaly (handprint) → reinterpreted past → charged action at the piano. Cost is felt (betraying the silent regimen, forfeiting sanctioned safety). No antagonist needed; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens when the pretender arrives and tries to “sunder” the archive. Aetos’s agency drives the turn by pre‑priming the rune to transform the incoming force. The price is mostly borne by the pretender; Aetos’s risk exposure reads minimal, slightly softening perceived cost. Still, escalation is coherent and culminates in a concrete narrowing of the antagonist’s options.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can hope be responsibly reclaimed) is signaled and steadily deepened: the atlas anomaly tightens from curiosity to mission. The meaningful tightening occurs when she reframes the site as a refuge and commits to the field excursion. Cost is emotional and conceptual rather than tactical; no external resistance tests her resolve, tempering escalation. Still, the internal/external weave lands via the living reef revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: reignite an ancient node to reweight the rebellion’s chances and her own search for meaning. Escalation is a single decisive tightening—entering the circle to become conduit—driven by her agency. The price is under‑articulated; we feel risk but don’t see a foreclosed path or immediate consequence beyond strain and awe. Still, tension coheres and spikes at ignition.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (whether/how to unseal and what stance to take toward tradition) is clear and tightens at the kite‑decoding beat into the thumb‑press and click. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (wind) complicates but does not resolve alone. The price—letting the creature go and accepting an enabling role—lands but remains understated. Tension operates more as wonder than threat, which keeps the ceiling just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she drown in the triggered memory or maintain her hard‑won present—is signaled early and tightens when “thunder” keys the trauma. The decisive deepening occurs at the paralysis and her tactical pivot from the photo to tactile anchors, foreclosing the path of collapse. Costs are felt through bodily seizing and the deliberate, effortful movements toward now. Resolution is earned by endurance and renunciation, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are singular and legible: escape (physical) entwined with self‑editing (internal). Escalation is clear—the clock tightens as walls close, culminating in the trade‑offs of which memories to step on and which to relinquish. Agency drives the turn (“redesign” via threads) with visible price in what she lets go. The conflict resolves through her altered stance rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—grasping the time anomaly—tightens when Silas chooses to intervene (pouring water), escalating from seeing to catalyzing. The drone’s unmaking raises tangible risk and cost, reweighting his inquiry. Pressure is more conceptual than adversarial but coheres and deepens appropriately for length. A clear option is foreclosed: naïve observation gives way to charged participation with consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to re‑entomb or detonate—tightens from discovery to transmission with one meaningful turn. The “blink” decision forecloses her prior path and alters her status irrevocably. The cost is conceptual/social more than physical, yet legible on the page. A small beat of tangible risk or immediate blowback could sharpen the price further.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early—preserve sanctuary or confront truth—and pressure tightens with the discovery of the chip and photograph. The internal moral calculus escalates convincingly to a single, consequential choice. External pressure is light, but under a situational/causal hybrid design the internal stakes suffice. The cost is clear though largely projected rather than immediately enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and clear—catch the goddess’s echo—and pressure escalates from navigation risk to psychological agitation to the thorn’s obstruction. The meaningful tightening is the discovery of the echo trapped within violent noise, which forces a change in method. Cost is legible in the accepted grief and the renunciation of anchoring-as-binding into anchoring-as-bearing. Slight ease of success (few setbacks) trims edge tension.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. profitable lie) is tight, with one solid tightening: recognizing that “to do nothing was to assent,” which forces an active countermeasure. The price—eschewing spectacle and courting dullness—is legible and binds to her legacy. Escalation is internal but coherent and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—binding the haunting guilt—tightens when her own old voice invades, forcing immediate method-finding and a costly choice to integrate rather than delete. Escalation is a clear intensification: glitch to personal haunting to procedural binding. The reversal is internal/technical, not adversarial, yet pressure coheres and narrows options. The price is surrendering the fantasy of erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: how to find meaning amid the Unlearning’s hush. The philosopher’s interjection tightens the moment, prompting Elara’s decisive “Listen” tactic and the tile activation. The price is a renunciation of definitive answers rather than a dramatic loss, but it’s legible and scaled to the form. Escalation is a clean intensification rather than multiple turns, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (recasting history) is clear, and pressure tightens through the move from private vision to public broadcast. The decisive step—renaming with proof—narrows options by committing him against the official account. However, external resistance is offstage, and the price/risk remains largely implied, moderating tension. Still, the deepening of knowledge (biometrics proving choice) credibly escalates the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (win an encore by reconfiguring time) is signaled early and tightened when despair’s vortex tries to drag her back. Escalation occurs through accumulating echoes into a lattice and the tactical shift from fighting fractures to weaving them. The resolution is earned by her agency; the price is acceptance rather than reversal. Pressure could sharpen with one additional concrete constraint or loss mid‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (recovering a specific memory) is clear and narrows options at the pill decision and the geode touch. The meaningful tightening comes when somatic markers demand a tactile anchor, forcing the geode choice. Costs remain largely conceptual; the recovery unfolds with little resistance, keeping pressure moderate. The final act is earned through agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around the single stake of translating the unknown, intensifying via the fossil’s activation and the involuntary floating. The decisive deepening occurs when colors become meaningful under moonlight, narrowing his stance options. The resolution is an earned stance shift (to medium) rather than a contested choice; price is implied (submission of agency) but not heavily dramatized. Tension is graceful and steady, not sharp or adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (reconfiguring the people’s fate) is clear, with escalation via the mounting catalog and the discovery of the obsidian “last piece.” The meaningful tightening arrives when she shifts from sorting to acting, risking altering the measure of life. Pressure remains mostly conceptual and meditative; the cost is absorbed quietly rather than through a sharp on-page loss. Still, agency drives the final turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (avert a catastrophic breach by lending reputation) is active and coheres. Pressure tightens when the runner states “They will only believe it…” forcing a moral trade‑off that risks imprisonment. The external stakes dovetail with the internal quest for courage. Slight under‑pressure in the middle—decoding comes too smoothly to fully test resolve before the ask.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keep the oath by waiting out the storm’s true end—is clear and tightens toward the last‑drop turn. Escalation is subtle and textural rather than adversarial; the felt price is patience and self‑containment. Lack of sharper competing pressure or potential forfeiture keeps the cost modest. The final choice is nonetheless agentive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure deepens through accumulation: each compassionate act yields stronger visions, culminating in the decisive evening alignment and Elara’s choice to commit her intention to the clay. Stakes stay singular and coherent (understanding → belonging/maintenance). The price is subtle—time, attention, and a binding of self to the place—but present. No explicit antagonist, yet the wasteland’s entropy serves as persistent opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are focused on making contact and offering possibility; escalation occurs as lights flick on and beams are redirected. The cost is subtle—accepting small defiance over transformative rescue—but present. No antagonist or major reversal, yet the tightening is clear for this length. A slightly sharper felt price would raise the band.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (coexisting with her catastrophic past) tightens effectively at the low‑tide reveal and the hum’s pitch change. Agency drives the turn: placing the sundial reweights options and unlocks the window. The price is internal and quiet—acceptance over resurrection—credible but soft in on‑page friction. A touch more resistance or risk in the descent might have intensified pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (reconnecting to purpose) tightens through a single decisive deepening: transforming private letters into public art. Pressure is coherent but gentle; there’s no sharp foreclosing loss beyond surrendering secrecy as material. Pilgrims’ reactions function as soft validation rather than a test with real risk. The escalation fits the accumulative design but remains low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—protecting communal agency—tightens as crowds polarize on the quad while Aris programs the sequence. The reversal is her protocol-breaking broadcast, which narrows ethical options and carries a modest on-page cost. Escalation is coherent and protagonist-driven without coincidence resolving the core problem. A clearer price (e.g., institutional fallout) would raise pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the key under collapsing space and fear—is signaled early and tightened sharply when the geometry mutinies. The meaningful turn is Elara’s plunge of the compass, foreclosing flight in favor of a risky anchor. The price is endurance under escalating pressure, with agency driving the resolution. Slightly modest external consequence keeps this just short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (making the portrait “true”) tightens when Ellis abandons a purely analytical tactic for an empathy‑led one, narrowing his options and committing to a risk. The decisive turn is his choice to integrate opposites, leading to external validation by the detective. Prices remain mostly internal and conceptual, keeping escalation strong but not punishing. Tension is quiet yet cumulative and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake (truth/vindication) with a meaningful tightening at the nail. The dread‑charged descent and the willingness to pull create a visible price and foreclose retreat. Escalation is driven by her agency rather than coincidence, though the decode phase is summarized and thus dampens in‑scene friction. The post‑release mandate reframes stakes rather than relaxing them.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: decode and deliver the message to reclaim agency over “never.” Escalation is coherent (decoding → hidden path → encounter), but resistance is light and the world offers few counterpressures. Agency drives turns; the price paid is internal rather than a trade‑off under duress. The tightening is meaningful but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (repeat the cycle or break it) is signaled early and deepens as the old man reframes “polished calm” as a prison. The conversation coherently narrows options toward a single decisive act. The cost is implied rather than tested by an external obstacle on the page, but the emotional price is legible. Escalation relies on revelation over confrontation, effective yet modest.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (decoding the inscriptions) tightens through the dream’s methodological reveal and the dawn verification. The key deepening is the reframe from static map to living clock, which narrows options and compels a new mode of response. The visible price is modest but real: abandoning the safer academic route for a riskier public‑facing healing act. Tension is primarily conceptual and internal but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates: from stabilizing herself to confronting an ancient hunger that offers a seductive fix. The key tightening is the bargain that would “save” the lost at the cost of planting the evil; Elara’s renunciation narrows options and exacts pain. The price remains—loss is accepted—and reads on the page. Tension is maintained at beat, sentence, and climax scales.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—tuning the intersection/renewing the covenant—is signaled early and tightens as the eclipse advances. The decisive escalation is the choice to cut into old scars, a visible price. External opposition is minimal, but internal and environmental pressures cohere and build. The ending’s cost and narrowing of options are legible at scale.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (heal a wound without unbalancing herself/the world) is clear and tightens when theft creates the void. The reversal—her solution becomes the problem—forces a costly trade. The sacrifice of her ideal future forecloses a path credibly. Tension operates at sentence and beat levels without needing an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (meaning after failure) is clear and tightens with the found case and letters. The “wrest” beat produces the key turn, and the new knowledge narrows his stance options. The cost is primarily internal and subdued; no external trade-off is forced on the page. Still, internal and external pressures interweave coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (reestablishing connection/understanding transition) is clear early, and pressure coheres as internal conflict tightens toward a renunciatory act. The decisive release forecloses a path (control/hoarding) with visible cost and alters options, earning the partial signal. Stakes remain largely interior, but they interlock with the external ping enough to feel consequential. One pronounced tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether Elian can “hold all that without breaking”—is clear and pressure coheres toward the creel’s opening. The decisive tightening is the timed seam; agency is expressed through his chosen acceptance (a refusal to resist) with emotional cost. Escalation is more tonal than antagonistic, appropriate to the lens, but the on-page struggle is gentler than the premise could bear. Still, the price (simultaneous joy and grief) reads unmistakably.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes (returning a buried truth to heal a rift) tighten through the discovery and the decision to deliver the pearl. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than opposition; the cadence shift occurs at contact when the light flares. The price is gentle but present—Elara’s relinquishment and vulnerability. Absence of external resistance keeps pressure modest.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (will she find a workable path to self-forgiveness?) is signaled early and tightened by the graffiti discovery and the old man’s lived cost. The decisive deepening is the shift from mapping to walking, narrowing her options. Price is acknowledged (length of path, her unmedicated state), even if external resistance is soft. The escalation is coherent but remains mostly interior and contemplative.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens coherently: discovery → threshold test → failure → adapted tactic (documentation) that succeeds. Dominant stake remains stable (access/understanding) and merges external and internal conflicts. The price is largely conceptual/emotional rather than materially narrowing options. Still, the shift to “document” credibly forecloses the prior approach and earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth and preservation versus imperial retribution—is declared early and tightened by the fracture and the coffee-stain vision. The ethical calculus presents real trade-offs; Elara forecloses both report and silence by choosing a third, costly path. Pressure escalates coherently to the gala’s charged dissolution. The price is not abstract: symbol destroyed, public grief unleashed, with implied personal peril.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve a last spark—tightens when she must cross a stillness that risks self‑erasure. The escalation is singular but effective, and agency drives the turn. The price is felt but brief; consequences are largely aesthetic rather than destabilizing. Still, tension coheres through the ritual’s demands.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible: restore the cycle and resolve the internal ache. Escalation tightens when the pool refuses to clear, forcing a re-approach premised on inherited memory, not force. The price is the acceptance of painful perspectives; while chiefly internal, it’s felt and alters tactics. Pressure is coherent though the conflict remains mostly interior and quietly resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—sell absolution or reclaim conscience—is signaled early and tightened by the client’s offer and the chimes’ alarm. The key turn is her perceiving his uncertainty and choosing interrogation over reassurance. The renunciation forecloses a path with cost, and tension threads through dialogue and object handling. Stakes remain coherent and conclude with a felt narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates via deliberate withholding, the mandate to track the “third ring,” and the shift into the grotto where Elara reveals her truth. The dominant stake (finding silence/vanishing) tightens into a redefinition of presence. The price—abandoning a naïve goal—is felt but remains abstract, with little material or relational fallout. Still, agency drives the turn: attention becomes the decisive act.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake (restore the canyon’s pulse) tightens through a decisive deepening when the birds’ patterns reframe the problem. The final act is agentic and resolves pressure without coincidence. Cost is primarily conceptual and physical strain; a more explicit loss would heighten the sense of price. Tension scales appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering sacred, unsystematized magic—tightens when the glacier cracks, forcing a costly, creative response. The reversal (imminent crushing) tests her commitment and narrows options to an improvised, risky tactic. Price is immediate (spent spirit, breathlessness) and seeds the larger renunciation. Pressure remains coherent and escalates once meaningfully at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (his synesthetic quest) is signaled early and tightens via the glowing key’s interpretive turn. Each dive increases pressure and narrows options toward the drawer and tube; the lantern release raises external hush/urgency. The price is mild but legible—physical risk and a rupture of his protective monotony. The resolution flows from his agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early: choose a single note for the next universe. Escalation tightens at the prophecy reversal, converting a seemingly virtuous option into an existential trap, forcing a harder, riskier choice. The final act—offering his own resonant frequency—pays a cost and forecloses other paths. Tension coheres at sentence and beat scales without detours.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (transmuting grief by naming) tightens via the hum intensifying and his will focusing through “scattered light.” The meaningful turn occurs when echoes become material gems, narrowing his options into a single act of articulation. Cost is felt in what endures (loneliness) rather than a loss suffered on the page, which keeps the escalation quiet. Still, the cadence shift is decisive and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are dominant and legible early (city’s survival), with a meaningful tightening via consecutive failures that force a new tactic. The drip becomes a disciplined constraint that narrows options to patience and micro‑welding; cost is time and stamina, ending in collapse. Pressure grows coherently under the causal lens. Resolution is earned by attention and endurance, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to honor the past—tightens effectively as the photo‑trail narrows options to a personal reckoning. The reversal is earned at the wife’s inscription, and the chosen action imposes a price (foregoing the “mercy” of erasure, inviting confrontation with state crews). Pressure is coherent and escalates once; an additional beat of external push could have heightened cost further. Still, the cadence shift lands.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early: obtain the fragile crystal before its window closes without shattering it amid chaos. Pressure tightens with the raptor’s dive, forcing a tactic that risks losing the only shot this year. The decisive act is her signal‑flame placed via pattern logic. The cost is primarily risk and vulnerability rather than a concrete loss, keeping the escalation strong but not brutal.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake—save Elias/keep trust—tightens through a protocol barrier that forecloses standard options, forcing a risky workaround. The manual override is earned by prior set‑up and her trait. The cost is present (dereliction risk, personal danger) though not fully dramatized in consequence. Escalation reads because/therefore rather than and‑then.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates through successive, riskier pairings, with the wave tightening pressure. The cost—embracing loss alongside joy—is legible and not sidestepped. Resolution stems from Kaelen’s agency rather than coincidence. A single, clean deepening beat leads into a decisive, earned closure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early: stop development and protect a rare ecology. Escalation occurs through investigation and the tactical planting choice; however, key pressure points are summarized rather than dramatized, and on‑page costs feel soft. The legal quagmire halting development arrives off‑stage. Still, agency drives the turn decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear from the start and tightens as he escalates from tuned drone to lullaby, then risks absolute silence. The cost is legible (voice gone; the gamble that silence may return nothing), and the tunnel’s demands constrain his methods. The reversal—noise to silence to unexpected laughter—lands as a pattern break under the accumulative lens. Agency drives the turn; nothing resolves by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (protect this place vs go home) is set early and tightens when the seam appears and the pendant warns of the cultist’s intent. Escalation is quiet but decisive: from passive waiting to intentional mending that forecloses a live option. The price—remaining in exile and burning the pendant’s power—is legible. No cheap coincidence resolves the conflict; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (obedient preservation vs. self-forged creation) is signaled early and tightens at the “penny dropped” pivot. Escalation is Alder-driven via successive attempts, then the irreversible act of unmaking sacred silver. The cost—destroying a relic and repudiating his role—is legible, if mostly conceptual. Tension flows from want versus fear without needing an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (detect the beginning within an ending) is signaled early and tightened when the “pinprick of perfect quiet” appears. Escalation proceeds via focused tactic change—dampening instead of amplifying—leading to the reverse explosion. The absence of strong counterpressure or a concrete sacrifice limits felt cost. Still, agency clearly drives the meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (prevent unwriting) is clear and escalates coherently as commuters fade and overlapping ferries intensify. The meaningful tightening is Felix choosing a risky, nonstandard tactic—broadcasting to the vessel across “the static hiss between seconds.” Yet the path contains few setbacks or tradeoffs, and the price is largely conceptual at the end rather than felt mid-crisis. Agency drives the turn, but cost on the peak beat is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting a grieving mind—is established early and escalates coherently to the inward “eruption.” The pressure is more ceremonial than contested; Elara’s agency manifests in preparation and execution rather than live, difficult trade‑offs. Cost is visible in Arthur’s overwhelming catharsis, not in a choice that narrows Elara’s options. A single effective deepening occurs as the air grows “thick,” but escalation remains largely inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    One dominant stake—unlocking and charting a path from abyss to stars—tightens through decisive beats (activation, long study, risky transmission). The brief pause after sending the plot provides a credible tension spike before the payoff. Costs remain soft and mostly conceptual; we don’t see a concrete loss or trade‑off beyond identity shift and duty repurposing. Still, escalation is protagonist-driven and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and legible: deliver reassurance before the heart-energy fades. The meaningful tightening arrives with the signal weakening, narrowing options and forcing the decision to speak back. The cost is modest (an ethical and emotional burden rather than a tangible loss), but it does reweight the ending. Tension is quiet yet real and coherent to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stakes (answers/memory vs. fear/time) tighten through the crawl and culminate in the translation beat. The codex‑enabled path escalates coherently; the bulkhead forces a costly crossing. The closing choice to leave with testimony under literal pressure preserves consequence. Stakes remain personal but charged and do not deflate.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early: repair Julian enough to extract wisdom; pressure escalates as each alignment causes pain and exhaustion. The “It hurts” admission tightens the conflict and forces Elara’s recommitment at cost. The endurance choice at the end is an earned narrowing of options. Stakes remain intimate but felt, with no undercutting coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake (preserve language vs. risk sanity) is signaled early and tightened by the curse’s awakening. The flock-created vacuum is a decisive deepening that tests her method and triggers the irreversible cost. Agency remains central: she focuses textures, then chooses to hold on. The price is unmistakable and ongoing, reweighting all prior effort.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—participation vs. extraction—tightens through the confessions and Elara’s nudge, culminating in Aris’s decisive throw. The arrowhead’s transformation into a “node” embodies the internal trade‑off, and the laughter from the Changed reweights the choice. Escalation is primarily tonal/density‑based (accumulative) rather than driven by obstacles, but it remains coherent. The price is felt as a renunciation rather than a loss tested by counterforce.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (reviving lost enchantment vs. capture/erasure) is signaled early and tightened coherently. The chase compresses options; the failed first attempt forecloses time and forces a higher‑cost tactic (sacrificing the shell). The Warden’s self‑uprooting provides a visible price and irreversible turn. Agency rather than coincidence drives each escalation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving a forbidden connection under surveillance—is clear and escalates when the drone pins Kael. His choice to stand rather than run is a credible endurance decision that tests his ethic. The price is ongoing exposure; the silent “understanding” with the system keeps pressure alive through the end. Tightening is singular but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—awakening a lost carousel—remains coherent and narrows to the decision to give silence through the halo fragment. Escalation is primarily tonal and sensory; little external resistance or loss presses her to adapt tactics. The turn from stillness to song is satisfying, but the price and threat contours feel gentle. Strong deepening, modest tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (find the place before stories form) are clear and the pressure coheres as density increases toward the epicenter. The meaningful tightening is her arrival at the singularity with the scarf to her lips, triggering the “reawakening.” However, the price paid for success is mostly atmospheric; no option is explicitly foreclosed beyond continued not‑knowing. Tension remains lyric and inward, not contested.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (vitalize/capture the dream) is established early, and pressure coheres around the dawn window and the discovered palette. The tightening arrives with the first stroke that holds light, escalating from recording to creating. Resolution is protagonist-driven, but the price paid is largely positive; absence of a sharper trade-off keeps the tension from cresting higher.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is focused (unlock the family truth), and pressure coheres: he chooses a destabilizing narrative that tests her fixed story. The escalation is a single decisive deepening (from fear to grief), with a visible emotional price marked by the tear. Stakes remain intimate but credible; the lack of a second tightening beat keeps it short of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and present (recover the lost memory), with escalation through time pressure (fading light), physical cost (numbness), and a knowledge turn. The tightening beat—the celestial map recognition—credibly changes options and leads to the ring. The price is chiefly emotional and retrospective, with some bodily cost; a sharper on‑page trade‑off at peak (e.g., risk of hypothermia or abandoning the search) could heighten pressure further. Still, resolution is earned by his attention and choice.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—unlocking exile—tightens when the apprentice despairs and Elias redirects her to the fixed image, narrowing options. The realization reframes the situation (“not an exile, a lock”) and forces the consequential trade. Pressure coheres without needing an antagonist; the price is Elias’s departure and the apprentice’s burden. Escalation is compact but decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres and tightens when the grayness pushes back and the tapestry flickers, forcing a deeper offer (succor) at visible cost. Stakes are singular and legible (preserve wonder’s color); the near-failure beat credibly escalates. Resolution stems from her agency rather than luck. The price is energy/essence spent, with the larger problem only partially relieved.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—ground the restless spirit by exhuming truth—is signaled early and tightens through the tactile labor toward the “monstrous, tangled fist of rope.” The escalation is a clean deepening under the textural lens; the final loop’s release is the single decisive intensification. The price is emotional and bodily (suffocation, dread) and her agency drives the turn. A slightly sharper sense of risk if she failed could have raised the tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unlocking/understanding the threshold—tightens once with the keystone realization and the decision to whisper rather than force. Escalation is controlled but low‑amplitude; danger is implied rather than dramatized. Agency drives the turn and the resolution feels earned. The cost register remains gentle, limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (understanding “letting go”) is present early and tightens with the librarian’s note, then crystallizes via the accidental break. Under the accumulative lens, the escalation reads as a decisive densification rather than a reversal; it works, though agency is primarily observational at the peak. The cost registers as a renunciation/acceptance, with no competing path remaining. A slightly clearer on‑page tradeoff would intensify the price.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (“free the ghost via a clean transmission”) is explicit and tightened by the between-lightning-and-thunder clock. A live constraint (incomplete matrix without the bolt plate) forces a trade-off, and the storm escalation narrows options credibly. The cost is felt (spending the heirloom’s aura and risking the singular window), though it remains more conceptual than material. Agency drives the climax: she inserts the plate and encodes through song despite the thunder’s arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal—honoring duty while uncovering/holding joy—and escalation arrives via the discovery and decoding sequence. The “ten floors of grace” clock provides a soft squeeze, but external pressure is minimal and no option is truly foreclosed beyond quiet renunciation. The turn from courier to “keeper of light” deepens meaning rather than forcing a hard trade‑off. Effective but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (continue the life’s work vs. survival anxiety) is signaled and tightened decisively by the tether break. Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens—the ascent narrows options as air thins, and she pays a price to keep working (numbness, hypoxia risk) before renouncing control. Agency manifests in attention and classification culminating in the acceptance choice. Slightly clearer tactical costs (e.g., foregoing an obvious safety measure) would raise the felt trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Primary stake—preserving/echoing a vanishing space—tightens under the demolition clock. Escalation is coherent: discovery of the coin’s method, then the precise lock, then the last‑second crafting choice. The felt price is time and risk (abandoning brush; one shot), though the pain is more poised than punishing. No antagonist is needed; the clock suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (securing and claiming a discovery) is clear, and escalation occurs as the cipher resolves into coordinates and the phenomenon manifests. The primary pressure is internal and procedural; there’s no counterforce or genuine risk beyond the moment passing. The refusal to summon others is a meaningful tightening with a personal cost. Still, the conflict remains gentle and never truly narrows options under threat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—repairing a fracture in time—tightens via the repeated failed gear fits and the interpretive leap to “uncap.” The reversal pivots on agency (choosing to uncap the vial) rather than coincidence. Cost is present but light (consuming a unique resource; bodily cold) and the pressure remains mostly internal, craft-based. Escalation is sufficient at this length but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (heal the blight by preserving trust) is established early and tightens as faith frays. The meaningful deepening arrives with the map and “Look Up,” changing knowledge and restoring cohesion. Aelia’s agency drives every turn, though the explicit price of manifesting (beyond prior depletion) could be sharper. Tension coheres without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve or release the world’s tempo. Pressure tightens when the puppet head reframes the problem from repair to response; the subsequent decision forecloses a path with felt consequence. The cost is surrendering the adjuster’s mandate to prolong against an ending that wants to arrive. Stakes stay coherent and focused without requiring an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (get her out before frost/birds) is clear and tightens once via the birds’ dive and then the blueprint/ key turn. Escalation is steady but the decisive solution arrives with limited price; no trade-off or loss marks the change. Agency belongs to Kaelen at the pedestal, but pressure eases quickly after the discovery. The live clock is present but never forces a compromise.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (atonement through a better design) is legible and tightened by the foam‑insight beat. Escalation is primarily internal; there’s no antagonist or concrete external block, so pressure remains low-key. The final decision forecloses hiding but doesn’t force a hard trade on the page. The ethical calculus (don’t build a cage; build a process) sharpens the peak but stays conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are legible (parole could be revoked), but pressure scarcely tightens; the ritual proceeds without meaningful jeopardy or trade‑off beyond the bottle’s depletion. The core turn is the incision’s success rather than a choice under duress. A single deepening beat (mapping absences) reframes the task effectively. The cost lands, yet escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake (contain/remediate stored remorse) escalates decisively when touch triggers overwhelming grief, forcing the subsumption choice. The cost is unmistakable and paid on the page through sustained psychic endurance. The turn is single but sufficient at this length, with pressure coherent from discovery to dissolution. A small additional complication could have tightened the screw further, but what’s here is effective.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes (reconnect the silos via the clock’s song) are legible and the tightening beat is the risky re‑seating of the counterweight. Pressure escalates from silence to a city‑wide acoustic cascade, but opposition is soft and cost is low. The reversal—nothing happens, then the shudder—works. A sharper constraint or failure beat would deepen the felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes—mastery without psychic collapse; salvaging meaning from ruins—tighten via the painful influx and the seared predecessor’s failure. The key turn is her shaken withdrawal and resolve to integrate the wound, narrowing options away from “fixing” toward bearing fracture. Cost is felt (another man’s tears, quaking threat to sanity) and carried into the final decision. Pressure could be sharpened by one concrete risk to body or device, but current escalation reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear—recover and activate the seeds before inversion ends—and they escalate modestly when gravity weakens. The key turn is activation (script flowing into her) followed by the choice to bear the vigilance. However, resistance is minimal; success feels smooth, with no adverse consequence or narrowed option beyond the ticking window. The cost is mostly post‑choice responsibility rather than on‑page sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: restore sound. Escalation arrives via the insight from stress-crack forensics and the redesign toward invitation over force; despair tightens pressure just before the breeze. The decisive human act (her strum) compounds the external turn and pays an emotional price. While quiet, the deepening is clear and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—piercing the cartographer’s silence—tightens under the live clock and the rising Nexus pulse. The key deepening is Kael reading the finger taps as coordinates, shifting options from “broken” to “listening.” Prices are subdued (fatigue, moral solitude) rather than overt sacrifices, keeping the pressure elegant but not searing. Resolution arises from Kael’s deliberate method, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (unlocking the grandfather’s wisdom and stance) is active early and deepens when noise intrudes. The fireworks serve as coherent external pressure that forces a stance crystallization. The cost—relinquishing her opposition to noise—is legible. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but it tightens effectively under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding serenity within disturbance—is tested and escalates when impatience triggers the scent burst, forcing a costly stance. The tightening forecloses the “control/relocate” path; she renounces intervention and embraces endurance. The pressure coheres internally; no external antagonist is needed. Slightly smooth passage from shock to calm prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (discovering the source during the brief inversion) tightens as options narrow and risks rise (skiff strain, uprooted fruit, exposed roots). The meaningful deepening occurs in the geode as knowledge and meaning shift. The external danger remains more implied than dramatized, slightly softening the felt price. Nevertheless, the hour-long window coherently pressures tactics and decision-making.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from survey to existential threat via the arena discovery and the Arcadia tie-in. The tightening comes when the convergence’s purpose clarifies and her tactics shift to intervention. However, the on-page price remains light—she commits but doesn’t visibly lose or trade off a resource beyond risk. Still, pressure is coherent and grows to a poised confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres and deepens—he must act at a precise moment and choose an untested method (humming through amber/ice) in a volatile acoustic environment. The meaningful tightening is the synchronized chisel strike and the decision to conduct light, not bells. Cost is felt but modest; conflict leans internal and ritual-to-creation rather than adversarial. Escalation is elegant but remains a single, smooth swell rather than layered trade‑offs.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—will she confront and learn from her failure at cost?—tightens when she steps through and confronts the “underside” manifestations. Her choice to study rather than repair and then to seal and leave forecloses options with a conceptual price. Pressure is coherent but largely internal; escalation is measured rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: curiosity → external empathic immersion → ego fracture → inward confrontation with loneliness. Stakes escalate from study to self-endangerment, and the price (identity destabilization) is legible. A single deepening turn (turning the halo inward) narrows options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure tightens meaningfully when the hermit rejects the box and the pendant answers to lineage, forcing Silas to act rather than deliver. The escalation is coherent under the causal lens, and the beam‑through‑wings choice is protagonist‑driven. Cost is implied (responsibility; relinquishing his old identity) but not sharply dramatized, keeping the stakes more spiritual than contested. Still, the internal and external threads mesh at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is stated early and tightened by the prism’s failure. The meaningful deepening is her shift of attention to the frost, which changes options/knowledge. Cost is largely internal and conceptual, but it’s felt in the despair beat and in letting go of a life-defining assumption. A sharper external pressure could have intensified the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake (stop the raveling silence) and tightens via the star-map revelation that narrows options to a costly remedy. The reversal is Elara abandoning the only tactic she’s clung to—recommencing weaving—in favor of destroying the loom. The price is felt and permanent, and the orchard’s healing is not cost-free. Minor note: the interim beat of daily recommencement risks slight repetition before the decisive shift.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and coherent throughout: securing resilient infrastructure by braving the disorienting mines. Pressure tightens at the psychic assault, forcing the tactical use of silk and culminating in the memory‑for‑knowledge barter—an on‑page cost. Escalation is relatively smooth rather than jagged but remains agency‑driven. The price paid meaningfully changes later options (confidence in craft, altered self).

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (truth/Aris) is signaled early; pressure tightens with the cycle peak and the vision, culminating in a reweighted mission. The decisive deepening arrives via the Aris confrontation and the “anchor” revelation. On-page opposition is largely observational, with little direct risk or trade-off beyond burden, keeping escalation measured rather than gripping. The final stance crystallizes credibly, not explosively.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are simple and focused: keep the shared light (letters) from being extinguished. Escalation is coherent: lamp dies → presence intensifies → door blasts open → Elias asserts agency with a symbolic barricade. The price is an exposed vulnerability and a night of fear resisted, appropriately scaled for the length. The reversal hinges on his decision to translate Elara’s code into action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: whether and how Silas wields the lighthouse’s power during a monumental storm. The meaningful tightening is his slight over-adjustment that transforms the beam and raises consequences from maritime safety to geopolitical impact. Agency drives the turn, but the price is primarily internal—no foreclosed external option or evident loss beyond moral burden. Still, the end stance is clearly reweighted by that cost.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes center on identity/integration; pressure coheres as he commits to the cryptic method, finds the tea house, and submits to the nonverbal test. The main tightening is the transition from seeking facts to witnessing a felt biography via illumination. The cost is subtly rendered (acceptance of a shared self), so while escalation is clear, it remains gentle rather than acute. No coincidence resolves the arc; agency carries it.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure tightens at the synchronized “ping” and moonbreak, and deepens when the nebula resolves into vignettes culminating in the yew’s memory. Stakes are internal yet coherent: discovery versus rote maintenance, measurement versus holding. The visible price is a relinquishment of her prior frame; escalation is more deepening than reversal but sufficient at this length. A touch more friction or trade‑off on the clock would raise tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (rekindle the realm) is clear, and escalation reads as density increase: one note begets many, reweaving light into a new tapestry. The key tightening is the communal convergence around the mica window. The price remains more atmospheric than explicit, so the risk feels gentle rather than sharp. Still, the protagonist’s agency drives the turn and resolution credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: reclaiming agency over a humiliating error. Pressure tightens once meaningfully as she moves from avoidance to direct contact with the incriminating chapter and discovers the nested paradox. The price—foreclosing self‑exile and accepting ongoing public memory of error—registers, though it remains understated. No extraneous reversals; escalation is modest but real.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pressure is gentle but coherent: loneliness and cultural amnesia tighten into a choice to believe and join the tending. The uncloak is the decisive deepening that narrows options, shifting Elara from witness to custodian. Cost is present but conceptual (ongoing work, fragile absolution, birds still gone), making the climax quiet rather than combative. Stakes stay focused on memory vs erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear (meaning vs oblivion), and the meaningful tightening comes as the sampling deepens into a coherent vision that reweights options. The price—expending the slide’s magic and relinquishing the tomb‑archive paradigm—is present but mostly intellectual. Escalation is more meditative build than frictional struggle; no antagonistic resistance or costly trade‑off beyond time and final expenditure. Still, agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and pressure builds coherently from pursuit to cornering Silas. The tightening arrives when facts corner him and his non‑verbal admission forces Elara’s internal collapse—a costlier outcome than a clean confession. Agency remains with her: she presses, holds ground, and chooses what to record. The price—lost trust and the spent heirloom—reads clearly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused on knowing why the weather‑bearers exist and what the ring is for; escalation comes from the density surge and the ring’s wild spin to a person. The tightening forecloses the option of remaining a detached observer when the ring fixes on the woman; he must risk approach and belief. Costs remain primarily internal but are legible and affect the outcome. Absence of a strong external antagonist keeps tension modest but coherent for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—stop being a conduit for others’ ghosts and claim authorship—are stated early and paid off. Escalation tightens through choices: he rejects the mechanical puzzle (throw), follows the key, tears the canvas, turns the lock. The price is interior (a reckoning with wasted years) rather than external pushback; still, the narrowing of options is felt. One decisive intensification suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent: locating the true source to save a city starving for truth. Escalation tightens via physical degradation under lies and a restorative jolt from the plumber’s candid admission, enabling the push to the cavern. The ending choice (share truth “no matter the personal cost”) resolves the pressure credibly. The price is forecast rather than felt on the page at the last beat, keeping it strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are singular and legible from the outset: restore the valley’s sustaining harmony. Escalation arrives via the discovery that cleaning is insufficient, forcing a more complex re‑tuning—an apt tightening for this length. The price is mostly conceptual/endurance rather than a painful trade‑off, but it does reweight her role and the fragility of the system. Tension remains steady and focused without empty intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates coherently as the storm peaks and the compressed nexus destabilizes. Key tightening beats—opening the box and then miniaturizing—narrow options toward the risky offering to the rose. Agency drives every turn; coincidence does not resolve the conflict. The cost reads as real but mostly potential, not materially paid by K-27.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—can listening mend a rupture—tightens when the locket connects to Leo and Elara chooses silence as action. Pressure escalates coherently toward the hospital scene, but Elara sacrifices little beyond time and emotional bandwidth. The decisive deepening is Leo’s confession, precipitated by her stance rather than a difficult trade. The ending’s earned calm reweights stakes, though the path remains relatively low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are coherent (liberate vs. remain imprisoned/alone), and escalation comes from the emptiness pattern → emotional encryption → AI reveal → final reverse dance. The decisive act belongs to Elara and is earned by her established method. The price and resistance are largely internal; external pressure never truly narrows options beyond design. Still, the single meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around the single stake of reclaiming memory and breaking the world’s hush; escalation moves from pier anomaly to deeper, riskier exhumation with physical penalties. The pick work under unpredictable gravity is a credible tightening that narrows options to endurance. Resolution flows from her agency rather than coincidence. The price is felt in body and in the choice to leave most memories undisturbed.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and pressure coheres as she narrows from mapping general noise to the core syllable. The deepening is a clear tightening rather than a reversal; agency drives the outcome via nonviolent method. Cost registers as painstaking effort and complete expenditure of calm, but there’s little visible price beyond fatigue. The escalation is elegant and sufficient under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten when Elara abandons the protective lie and demands truth; that act catalyzes the fade and gift transfer. The cost—losing the mentor while gaining custodial duty—reads clearly in the final cadence. Pressure is primarily internal and situational, fitting the lens, though conflict remains gentle rather than knife‑edge. The decisive deepening arrives on time and coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—whether to confront the quarantined memory—tightens when she chooses to use the Archive, narrowing options. The escalation is internal but clear: curiosity → commitment → inundation by memory, with an unmistakable price. The dawn clock adds a cadence shift that supports the peak. No antagonist is needed; agency drives resolution with a felt surrender of her insulating stance.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates cleanly with Varos’s entrance and the “tell” that could condemn the forgery, then deepens into a complicity trade-off rather than a neat absolution. The decisive tightening comes from the hidden-seal reveal, narrowing options toward sanctioned treason. Cost is more conceptual than visceral; danger dissipates quickly once the Queen’s deniable plan is disclosed. Still, the turn is earned and the stakes remain legible.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—discover why some people echo—is signaled early and deepens through the shell, text, and the Nexus. Escalation is primarily revelatory; there’s little resistance or trade-off beyond travel and solemn duty. The meaningful tightening arrives when the chorus resolves into the order’s truth, prompting her commitment. The on-page price is subdued, so tension doesn’t fully crest.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—expose a single devastating lie—is signaled early and tightens as she isolates the “window” and names the purser. Escalation reads as a density shift from chorus to singular clarity, appropriate for the chosen lens. The price is implied (ethical burden, the dead’s peace) rather than dramatized as a trade‑off that forecloses another path in-scene. Still, agency clearly drives the decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving the fireflies’ hidden pattern—stays focused; the meaningful tightening is the whistle initiating an organized river of light and a specific rescue. Costs are understated but legible: time, anonymity, and the friction against human illumination. Pressure deepens through Lin’s question, which tests and clarifies Ren’s stance; no major reversal appears, but the cadence shift at the end reweights options. The conflict remains quiet, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—expose truth vs. protect life—tightens credibly when the storm escalates and the letters reframe risk. The internal conflict becomes a choice with cost, not a summary: she decides not to unearth the diamond. While there’s no explicit antagonist, coherent pressure builds to stance crystallization. A more tangible external consequence might have heightened the price further, but the ethical trade‑off is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (control vs understanding) tightens when both voices overlap in a “dissonant roar.” The storm’s zenith and the equipment risks escalate pressure credibly. The renunciation forecloses a live path, but the on-page price is more conceptual than viscerally felt. Still, the agency-driven act provides a meaningful turn.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting the lullaby—is signaled early and tightened by the “box opens/no music” reversal that forces a new tactic (seek living memory). The weeks‑long search and harmonica testing escalate pressure appropriately for the length. The visible price is stamina and time, not a sharp sacrifice, so the felt cost is gentle. Resolution is earned through Orin’s choices, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early; pressure tightens when the “harsh” frequency provokes an external slam. The decisive adaptation comes from listening and fine adjustments, a meaningful deepening rather than brute force. The price is mainly risk and time pressure; no visible sacrifice slightly softens the punch.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—witnessing the alignment to unyoke the sanctuary—tightens as the moons converge; escalation reads as cadence intensification rather than reversal. Agency is endurance/attention: she chooses to hold under pressure, foreclosing haste. Cost remains mostly interior and conceptual, which tempers heat but fits the lens. A single added obstacle could have clarified price at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on truth and responsibility: empiricism versus witness. Pressure tightens with the psychic jolt, forcing a stance that forecloses strict empiricism and invites professional risk. The escalation is primarily internal but legible and consequential. A clearer on‑page price (e.g., risking censure) would raise the score.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear (fulfilling a moral charge); pressure tightens through the meticulous diagnosis and the discovery of the hair‑thin fault. The escalation is quiet but effective for this lens, moving from request to pinpointed risk (straightening the fragile pivot) to activation. The felt price remains modest—no contested decision or sacrifice at the peak—so stakes don’t sharpen into a tradeoff.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and the machine’s failure provides a genuine pivot, but escalation is gentle and largely solved by a single inspired try. Options don’t narrow so much as reveal a previously untried tool; risk and price remain abstract. The ending’s shift reads earned but low‑pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—uncovering truth versus corporate erasure and a nonhuman archive—tightens as clues concentrate toward the black box transmission. The reversal is knowledge‑based rather than confrontational, but the price (implicating the company and awakening a looming signal) is felt. Escalation is coherent and cumulative though largely investigative. A clearer immediate risk or trade‑off on the page would raise pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are singular and high (village survival), and pressure tightens once through the mirror-vision turn. Yet resistance is low: the plan works on first try, authority instantly mobilizes villagers, and no option is foreclosed with felt price. The climax arrives and resolves without a meaningful setback. Tension is present but not deeply testing.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (to learn the sound of endings) is signaled early and coherently escalates via storm → blizzard → ice settling. The meaningful tightening is situational endurance that forces stance crystallization; her agency is attention and renunciation. The price is subtle—letting go of the earlier death‑drive—rather than a hard trade‑off, but it charges the ending. No antagonist is needed; the pressure is environmental and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming the “always” for the land/self) is signaled early and tightens as the letter reframes from wound to resource. Escalation manifests as density and re‑valuation rather than confrontation, culminating in the irrevocable disposal of the shard. The cost is legible: relinquishing a relic and accepting a redefined promise. Pressure remains coherent, though it never peaks into acute conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens when the prophet’s presence threatens collapse. The Line Walker’s tactical shift (triggering the parapet) creates a clear narrowing of options to complete the ritual. Stakes remain contained but coherent. The on‑page price is subtle, mostly as risk and the acceptance of preserving only an echo.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal and communal: whether pain can be reconfigured into shared meaning. Pressure deepens once (from private discovery to public unveiling), but escalation remains gentle and largely conflict‑free. Costs or foreclosed options aren’t distinctly tested on the page. The result is satisfying yet low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: will she remain a silent observer or risk public testimony that redefines meaning’s “growth.” Escalation is clear: discovery → overwhelming sequences → choice to ascend and speak, with a small but real audience registering consequence. The cost is primarily reputational and psychic; no alternative path is explicitly foreclosed beyond continued isolation. One decisive tightening lands via her climb and address rather than multiple reversals, which suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (can she locate and hold the sound before memory strips it?) are signaled early and escalate via the marker defiance and the culminating vision. The key tightening forecloses a path: after the vision, she cannot execute the planned act with chalk. Pressure stays coherent to the last line where endurance is the only available agency. Slight limitation: only one explicit turn, but it suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: capture the uncatchable as the station fails. Escalation coheres (alarms → degradation → violent lurch), narrowing options to a single attempt; agency lies in prior preparation and present arming amid noise. The trigger is coincidental but pre‑taught and filtered by her design, not deus ex machina. The price—forsaking safety for the shot—reads, though on‑page consequences are mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused (a dignified, unified goodbye), and pressure coheres as Elara adapts tactics when the “song is skipping.” The decisive turn arrives with placing the vinyl and vocalizing the needle hiss, which unlocks the recognition. The price is quiet but present—choosing mercy over disclosure, and the irrevocable end. Escalation is subtle rather than jagged, fitting the lens and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: solve the noon‑shadow paradox. Pressure tightens when the automaton awakens broken, forcing a strategy pivot to relearning over weeks and aligning with the solstice clock. The conflict is primarily intellectual and procedural, with limited jeopardy or sacrifice beyond time and endurance. The turn is earned but relatively gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (retrieve Leo) is signaled early and tightens: private deduction → crossing into danger → setting the bone under looming Fae attention. The cost is tangible (Leo’s pain, Aris’s risk, an uncertain negotiation). Escalation is protagonist‑driven; each move raises exposure to the Fae. The ending’s truce stance forecloses immediate flight and reframes risk rather than dissolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes concentrate on discovering a non-fire way to share light; pressure is contemplative but coheres. The meaningful tightening is the shift from passive watching to active craft and distribution. Costs are subdued but legible: she rejects torches and embraces slow, unseen work. A stronger external counterforce could heighten tension, but within this mode the escalation reads.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming agency after viral exposure) is clear, and escalation occurs when Kael arrives and offers his charm, prompting Elara’s reciprocal proffer. The cost is vulnerability and the refusal to erase shame; she chooses to carry it differently. The pressure deepens rather than reverses, fitting the lens. A slightly soft external push limits peak intensity but not coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (find an ending) is clear and tightens via the woman’s story, which reframes “hope” from artifact to lived ethic. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate at this length. The price—abandoning his collecting tactic for committed authorship—is present but underplayed on the page. No overt counterforce tests the choice beyond internal resistance, keeping tension modest.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a narrowing window: the harvest moon’s alignment forces a now-or-never attempt as hope ebbs. The escalation is accumulative yet causal, with the machine’s ignition and the melody’s swelling as the meaningful tightening. Resolution is earned through Elara’s choice to sing and trust resonance. The price feels primarily conceptual/identity-level rather than materially costly.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: secure a permanent map of feeling before the moment dissipates. Escalation follows the lens via intensifying ritual density—pattern completion triggers flare, drawing charges the plate, the seal exacts the price. The cost (spent starlight; a one‑time chance) is clear, though pressure remains contemplative rather than combative. The final act is protagonist-driven and forecloses future options.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring the mountain’s resonance—is clear, and escalation deepens through the mapping and reassembly toward the activation beat. The tightening is more procedural than pressured; risk and trade‑off feel low and near‑inevitable. The visible price is mainly time and focus; no live threat complicates success. The final turn is satisfying but gently earned.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (measure without being entombed) is clear and escalates when misalignment traps her. The tightening forecloses flight; endurance/acceptance is the only viable tactic under pressure. The cost is legible on the page. Tension operates at line and scene levels without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is tight: shape grief within a limit. Escalation occurs as she rejects the obvious (lion) and discovers the cupped hand—an internal deepening that narrows options with a cost. The time constraint sharpens the choice; the click forecloses further work. Tension is quiet but real, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure builds through the ritual of turning the wheel, culminating in the decisive risk of viewing the last crystal. The dominant stake—whether to face or avoid the personal cost of seeing—tightens credibly. The cost is emotional but unmistakable; the final image forecloses nostalgia as a dwelling place. Quiet escalation matches the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are coherent—transform a dead terminal into a refuge—and escalation tracks through tangible steps. The key tightening is the dead hydraulics requiring a risky reroute of residual carnival power. However, resistance is minimal and consequences are largely untested; nothing pushes back after the system groans awake. The price of success doesn’t meaningfully foreclose a path on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—making peace with an abandoned dream—tightens when the “consecrated” space is breached; the bear’s listening forces a stance. The decisive act (placing the composition on the floor) carries a real, felt price and forecloses an option. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure accumulates coherently: deciphering the sundial narrows options and drives him under the decayed warehouse, where the stakes sharpen into identity. The decisive deepening occurs at the tapestry’s reveal, which reweights the dominant stake (truth vs. myth). External jeopardy is subdued; the price is internal, which trims intensity but not efficacy. One clear tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (coaxing the secret) is clear, and escalation arrives via the fulgurite-induced shift from fiber to luminous strands. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, consistent with the chosen lens. The price paid is largely endurance and time; no decisive foreclosing choice is forced on the page. The turn is meaningful but not high-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can presence heal or reconfigure a long grief?—is legible and tightens through the Countess’s test of his method and the thread metaphor. Escalation is a measured deepening rather than reversal, culminating in the rain/smile cadence shift. Cost is internal but felt: a guarded stance yields slightly, foreclosing continued total withdrawal. The conflict stays coherent and avoids melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering beauty—tightens through discovery, the renunciation of hatching, and the high‑risk activation. The final turn (song as absence) imposes a felt cost and forecloses naïve restoration. Pressure is largely internal but coherent and escalating; the months of failed prototypes deepen rather than stall. A more concrete external risk would heighten trade‑offs.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and deepens through the crafting ritual, culminating in the test of sound. Pressure builds by accumulation rather than reversals, with a meaningful cadence shift at the hum and realization. Cost is internal and credible, though no option is starkly foreclosed beyond an interior stance. A sharper on‑page trade‑off would intensify the sense of price.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: free the city’s trapped memories or endure its suffocating silence. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal—breadcrumbs broaden into a lock system, then the vigil tightens options to a single celestial window. The price is time, discipline, and the acceptance that joy returns as echo, not water. A slightly sharper risk or forfeiture in the vigil would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving the Garden’s meaning against quantification—is established and tightens when the probe begins “violent pinging.” The turn is Elara’s renunciation of the family pattern, choosing transformation over destruction. Pressure coheres under a causal lens; the visible price is mainly the renunciation rather than a concrete loss. A hair more consequence or risk on the page would heighten the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (reframing grief and his craft) is signaled and coherently intensified by the spectral directive and the migration’s presence. The meaningful tightening is the choice to “retrace” and the ensuing redefinition of his carving practice. Costs remain conceptual rather than dramatized losses, keeping pressure modest. Still, the internal/external threads align clearly through the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stake—restoring communal and geological balance—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure deepens via the discovery of compounded tiny errors and culminates in a time‑critical final adjustment at the pendulum’s apex. The on‑page cost reads as taxing focus and responsibility; the social consequences remain mostly offstage, keeping tension a touch abstract. Still, escalation tightens credibly to a single decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are intimate: deciphering intention and honoring it. Escalation is a steady deepening rather than sharp reversal—the tapestry’s logic coheres, sensations rise, the mechanism springs; pressure is coherent but low-friction with no significant obstacle. Agency drives the turns, and the closing renunciation reads earned, though the felt price remains subtle. A single decisive tightening exists but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early (energy future before reserves fade), and pressure tightens when he rejects the probable decline for the geothermal anomaly. The Blank Page’s all‑or‑nothing acceptance raises the risk; the final turn (from 0.0001% to certainty) narrows options to a single, dangerous path. The price is more conceptual than tangible in‑scene, which mutes the sense of loss or trade‑off. Nonetheless, escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (defy the silence at personal and cultural risk), and escalation proceeds from listening to seeking to making to broadcasting. Pressure remains coherent, but opposition is largely offstage; we never see a concrete obstacle or a price exacted mid‑scene. The decisive act is hers, yet the narrowing of options leans on implication. Effective, if a touch friction‑light for elite markets.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure builds coherently via the accumulative lens: the careful rendering, the deepening recognition of deception, and the timed stop of the chair. The decisive act forecloses a path (a fixed likeness) with emotional cost. Stakes remain internal but clear and escalating. One primary tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—truth versus state narrative—is established early and tightened by the discovery of the chronometer’s impact scar. The key escalation is the interpretive reversal that reframes cause and effect for the city’s fall. Pressure remains largely internal and intellectual, with limited palpable risk or material loss in-scene. Even so, the final decision to write under exile conditions reads as a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes are clear: preserve what’s vanishing by achieving true ensemble, with Leo as the live obstacle. Escalation arrives via thinning tactics (silencing sections, refocusing breath) until the final, seamless braid. The external loss of the program adds tangible cost, preventing tidy triumph. Pressure stays coherent and rises through one decisive intensification rather than multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (create something beautiful that reawakens feeling) is signaled early and tightened by the time constraint. Escalation is steady—the labor, the alignment, the single fruit, the risk of serving guests first—though resistance is mostly environmental and internal. The meaningful tightening arrives with the one-orb harvest and decision to serve, narrowing options. Costs are felt but remain gentle; no hard trade-off beyond risk and obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early (city’s survival systems) with one meaningful tightening: the battery permits only one restart path. The ethical calculus (food vs. light) is sharp and resolved through protagonist agency with a tangible price. Escalation is steady rather than twisty, but the narrowing of options is unmistakable. The hum’s return provides felt relief while the larger loss remains.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: to awaken/sanctify the house. The meaningful tightening occurs when she identifies the orris root as the keystone and decides to plant it, foreclosing her prior observer stance. Opposition is minimal, but the cadence shift is clear and the price—complicity in “gentle theft”—is woven into the act.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (maintain the prison or free its inhabitant) is signaled early and tightened by the presence’s context and the discovered mechanism. The decisive escalation is Veridian choosing to break the ampoule knowing it entails breaking himself; the price is unmistakable. Internal and external pressures braid cleanly, with the moral calculus (certainty versus creation) sharpening the peak beat. Resolution is earned by his renunciation and paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—commandeer the closed system—tightens from analysis to a single high‑risk execution beat. The chip’s precarious roll catalyzes a credible escalation, and the action forecloses the prior path (infinite ascent). Cost is legible but largely physical/conceptual; a deeper loss or trade‑off could have intensified consequence. Agency drives the turn without coincidence resolving the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (rekindling creative/relational meaning) is clear and tightened as the brush asserts will and Elara writes till dawn. Escalation is textural: density of images and the refracted sentences widen the field, then the knock compresses it to a single test of whether kindness echoes. Agency is quiet but decisive—she surrenders control to the brush and persists through exhaustion. The price is modest but real, and the ending grows from her prior choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (save the lens) is signaled early and escalates from failed vitrine to hazardous manual thaw. The tightening choice—risking the treacherous ledge to reach and melt the valve—narrows options and exacts physical and temporal cost. Resolution derives from her agency rather than luck. The post‑crisis vow deepens, rather than relaxes, the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset and tightens when activation initially “does nothing” before the thrum turns the scene. The escalation is protagonist-driven and culminates in a harsh irreversible consequence. Internal stakes are less conflicted than the external disaster, but the single decisive tightening is enough at this length. The cost is unmistakable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (escape scheduled death/fear) is signaled early and escalates coherently through each paradox entry, culminating in the final “Strength” note. Agency drives the turns; the advisor catalyzes but Elias must generate the contradictions. The “last ounce of will” frames a visible price. The tightening is singular but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (save orchard through transformation rather than opposition) is signaled early and coherently escalates as the storm strikes. The bell strike and tremolo read as decisive intensifications, and stamina becomes a visible price. Still, there’s little jeopardy of failure or foreclosed path beyond fatigue; adaptation is smooth rather than forced by a cornering reversal. Resolution is earned but not harrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (redirecting a dying city) tightens via the crack’s opportunity and culminates in a high‑agency act. Internal dread vs. resolve adds pressure, and knowledge deepening reweights options. The price is present but underplayed—no immediate backlash or material loss shown on the page. Nonetheless, the shift in heading visibly forecloses the prior drift.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates from private scholarship to a risky public mission via Elara’s evidence and the timed meeting. The dominant stake—whether Aris will remain isolated or commit to a dangerous, public recapture of truth—tightens credibly. However, external antagonism remains offstage and costs are asserted more than felt, softening peak tension. The reversal from solitary pursuit to pact is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserving/defining what’s left behind) tightens when Elara intrudes, forcing Ansel to choose disclosure and collaboration. The meaningful turn is the shift from solitary secrecy to shared stewardship, with a felt price in relinquishing control. Pressure is cohesive under the textural lens, if quiet. A sharper on-page consequence would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are focused (verify the founding truth), and escalation coheres: the blackout and the false shelf number narrow options until the hypothesis shift. The key tightening beat—reinterpreting the ledger as pointing to a tool—feels earned and consequential. Costs remain primarily conceptual; a sharper on‑page price would amplify pressure. Still, agency drives the turn and the resolution is not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (making a vessel for grief) is signaled early, and pressure tightens at the basilica with the explicit soul-cost. The middle beat deepens through the labor of polishing and folding, culminating in a reweighted end image. Conflict is largely internal; escalation is gentle but coherent under a causal lens. The cost reads, though no turn opposes him beyond sacrifice and endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding a locus of potential—is signaled early and escalates as the silence deepens and perception widens. The key tightening is the time pressure of cooling breakers and the shift from seeing to choosing to permeate the mirror. Cost registers as accepting the permanent scar within the pool and altering a vast instrument without a safety net. The pressure is internal and lyric, but coherent and rising under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on decoding/understanding, and escalation occurs through activation to alignment to resonance. Pressure remains gentle; obstacles are minimal and there’s no reversal testing commitment. The meaningful tightening is present but not strenuous. The cost is mostly a new obligation rather than a trade-off forced on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (deliver the lie or not) is signaled early and tightened when the client demands proof. The turn—reframing the watch hand as a “key” to truth—forces a trade‑off, paying in lost client trust and income. Internal and external tensions braid coherently. The price is visible in the client’s exit and Elara’s acceptance of ongoing burden.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming a past mistake into a shared path forward—is clear and tightened by the arrival of the “token.” The key escalation is internal: Kael’s confession reframes the object, prompting Elara’s renunciatory act. External pressure (72 breaths, mist) sets a frame but doesn’t materially stress later tactics. The cost is present but subtle, befitting the quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused on regaining purposeful motion and self-definition; pressure coheres as he trades the romance of stars for the utility of poles. The meaningful tightening is the choice to navigate pole-to-pole, which forecloses the grander option and demands a value trade. The cost remains internal but is felt, and the final decision to return “as a man in a kayak” pays that cost. Escalation is subdued yet sufficient for the quiet design.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes cohere—can she catalyze empathy through action—and the rescue provides the decisive test. Escalation is present but gentle; the survival threat and navigation risk are not intensely pressed on the page. The meaningful tightening occurs at the crevice light and the choice to prioritize another’s life. Consequences feel enduring internally though the external peril resolves quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular and legible: reforge the bond by altering a fatal moment. Pressure tightens as remembering turns to acting, with the decisive step into the memory narrowing options and demanding a price. The shield choice is an earned, agentive turn that interweaves internal bravery with external defense. Cost is present, if more emotional than material on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are clear early (recovering “lost time” after childbirth), and pressure coheres as the reading fails, the saucer reveals a false lead (repentance), and Elara redirects the search. Escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than external hazard; the narrowing occurs in her acceptance and choice to abandon the grand hunt. The price is gentle but present; an added beat of friction or potential failure would heighten squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—opening the locked dimension—tightens through painful accumulation and the mass penalty, culminating in a decisive, non‑violent act. The cost is unmistakable: laborious, self‑burdening grief to assemble the Tear, then a final push paid for by that weight. Pressure grows coherently under the chosen lens; no adversary needed. A sharper on‑page risk of failure at the final touch could heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    One dominant stake—what she will do with the “vessel of contained light” and what she’ll learn—tightens when the old woman demands it. The price (losing her last possession) is legible and paid. Escalation remains gentle and largely ordained; Elara’s agency is present but not contested beyond a brief startle. The result is satisfying but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around executing the signal before being stopped; Vorlag’s arrival is a clear tightening. The choice to reveal the quill/sliver to sway her is an earned turn that narrows options. Stakes skew conceptual and ideological, with minimal on‑page price paid beyond risk exposure, softening the felt escalation. Still, the hum spreading across the fort reweights the stakes credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (understanding at any cost) is signaled early and tightens toward a single consequential choice. The precognition creates a pointed tradeoff—step aside and live versus keep the promise and be unmade—making the cost legible. Pressure coheres and intensifies without side quests. The price paid (self‑unraveling) decisively forecloses future options.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—creating and fixing a forbidden poem during a narrow window—tightens when the power dies and she must endure without light. The timer and storm pressure create a meaningful narrowing of options and test her commitment. Resolution arises from a stance crystallization that redirects her purpose. The cost is felt more internally than externally, slightly softening the edge of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake (finding the library via duel), and escalation tightens when the 45° guard is forced. The decisive turn is Valerius converting martial advantage into deciphering action rather than finishing the bout. Stakes remain conceptual rather than visceral, with minimal visible price. Still, agency drives the outcome cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (seed a forbidden library inside the prison) is clear; the meaningful tightening is the discovery of the tin’s false bottom, which reframes options and commits them to a riskier path. Subsequent escalation is mostly montage; we don’t witness a concrete test or price paid beyond preparation, so pressure plateaus before the final charged poise. Internal stakes do deepen (identity molt to evolution), but a single on‑page complication would heighten cost. Solid, not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (navigation failure) is signaled early and tightened through the discovery of the hidden frame sequence. The choice to abandon comfort for abrasive, percussive playing constitutes a credible escalation and earns the result. A small micro‑beat where “nothing happened” before success adds tension. The visible price is light but present; the piece favors elegant efficiency over bruising consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (saving collective memory before the monsoon) is present and tightened by the clock and the skeptical instruments. The dream-triggered reframing deepens options and forces a trade-off in approach. Escalation is modest but coherent, peaking with rain’s arrival as she acts. The price is chiefly epistemic rather than materially painful, limiting peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is internal (survive and transform regret) with one meaningful tightening at the needle’s spin and the flood of sorrow. The tactical shift—diffusing via the lace’s breathing—reads as a clear escalation/response under the chosen lens. The price (accepting silence as the form of apology) is visible and charges the final image. It’s a gentle conflict, but pressure coheres and grows.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The dominant stake—Aris's emotional processing of grief—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict is internal, and the escalation works perfectly for an accumulative lens: the "gentle insurgency" of the dust patterns deepens the pressure on her initial coping mechanism until it fails.

    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: the integrity of the archive versus a man's reputation. The pressure escalates effectively from intellectual curiosity to a weighty moral dilemma.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stake is clear and the atmospheric pressure from the eclipse provides a powerful, non-traditional form of escalation. The cost is legible in Leo's tear.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story’s conflict is potent precisely because it is internal and conceptual. The dominant stake—the possibility of mapping emotion with logic—is established immediately and tested throughout. The introduction of the glass eyes provides a perfect deepening of the stakes, not by adding external threat, but by fundamentally changing the terms of the problem.

    The internal, philosophical stake is signaled early and pursued relentlessly. The escalation works as a textural deepening, with the pressure growing through sensory and psychic intensification rather than external obstacles.

    The dominant stake—reconnecting with Elara—is clear and compelling. The story achieves a meaningful deepening of this stake, shifting from a vague hope into a concrete, perilous quest. The central weakness, however, is that this escalation is not driven by the protagonist's agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.8)

However, the escalation of pressure is minimal; it's a static state of inquiry that deepens internally but doesn't face external tests.

The story achieves resolution, but without the earned, causal tightening expected at the highest level.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story masterfully handles an internal central conflict. The dominant stake—whether Aris will dissect or participate in the cosmic harmony—is signaled early and intensifies beautifully. The pressure deepens with each confession from the phone and her direct experience of the garden, culminating in a clear choice driven by her own agency.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)

The conflict escalates perfectly when the drone dips lower and then pins Kael in its searchlight, creating a moment of high tension.

    The conflict is expertly managed, with the central stake of Elias's freedom established immediately and consistently held under pressure. The escalation is driven by the apprentice's agency—her frustration and eventual breakthrough—which forces a decisive choice from Elias (to offer the final clue).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear, dominant internal stake. The discovery of the note provides a meaningful deepening of the core question. However, the final turn that resolves the conflict is not driven by protagonist agency; it is a result of an accident. Elara is a witness to her own epiphany rather than an actor who forces it through a costly choice. While the cost is felt, the lack of agency at this pivotal moment weakens the conflict's structure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stake—freeing the ghost—is established early and given urgency by the approaching storm. The conflict deepens effectively when the incomplete translation matrix forces Elara to find a physical key, a tightening driven by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story focuses on a single, potent internal stake: whether Rhys's legacy, and Elara's service to it, was one of grim duty or hidden beauty. This stake is signaled early and deepens decisively when the diary is decoded. The pressure is the limited time of the elevator ride, which forces her "gentle haste." The resolution provides a clear reweighting of the stake with a felt cost: the Commander gets the objects, but Elara gets the meaning, foreclosing any possibility of sharing this profound secret.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes a clear intellectual stake (proving her father's theory) and masterfully escalates it to an existential one with the snap of the tether.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story declares immense stakes ("a stutter in time itself") but fails to dramatize them, leaving the conflict feeling abstract and low-pressure.

The resolution comes from a piece of information, not from the protagonist overcoming escalating opposition through a costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the forgotten combination—is established early and escalated by a clear time pressure (the one-hour inversion).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    The stakes are clear, but the central conflict in the mine feels like a single, well-prepared-for test rather than a genuinely escalating pressure.

== Grader: Kimi K2 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to metabolize private loss—tightens as the butterfly-wing cosmos undercuts her “preprocessed certainty.” One clear deepening: she renounces hasty repair, accepting ongoing exposure as cost.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncover why she was targeted—tightens when the message reveals ecological stakes far larger than personal revenge. One clear escalation: from quiet endurance to public revelation, with the climb and the relay acting as physical price. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only reveals, never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—turn silence into music—tightens when early attempts yield only noise-made-visible. The fork-glass fusion is a single, irreversible escalation that forecloses the path of audible sound and crystallizes the new form.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—community self-reliance under sanctions—tightens when the “miracle” donations tempt passivity.  The revelation that the bounty is home-grown escalates the conflict to a moral fork: honesty vs sustaining hope.  Kael’s agency is the final turn; declaring the story he elects imposes an immediate on-page cost by abandoning pure truth to safeguard communal tenacity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—tightens once when the projected image shifts, forcing a choice. Escalation is accretive: each breath deepens memory, narrowing options until the tear is seized. Cost is emotional flood and vocational pivot. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (finding the tear) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—free mother from temporal fold—is signaled early and tightened once: the looped memory becomes the stitch Elara must unpick.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    The single dominant stake—the survival of genetic memory—is introduced in the second paragraph, escalated by the sentry, and paid with the Liberator’s freedom. Pressure ratchets through the countdown of the closing wall, narrowing to the irreversible seal.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—hearing the sound of trust breaking—tightens when the forge demands she relive the betrayal as victim and perpetrator. The deepening is irreversible: she gains the sound but loses the possibility of simple vengeance. Cost is legible in her “sorrowful, weathered peace.”

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capture the moment without capture herself—tightens when the constable’s boot removes the flower-code option. The leap is a visible price that forecloses stealth forever. Escalation is causal and single-threaded, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding thought—tightens through each looped attempt; the violin’s resonance raises the cost of failure.

    Dominant stake—preserve the garden’s illusion—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: Luck-Meter reading → threat of shutdown → Elara’s proof.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—decode and enact Valerius’s final work—tightens once: discovery of the cipher forces the irreversible choice to play. Agency is hers; the building’s groan is the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single deepened stake—integrity of both forecasting and personal epistemic footing—compresses rather than escalates. Fever break as clock reset, data void as tightening vise, spike as irreversible rupture; each phase explicitly forecloses denial. No second reversal required at this length; absence of further external antagonist only slightly softens the punch.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—burden of swallowed truth—escalates with each valve squeal until Elara becomes the sole custodian. The ghost shift’s panic re-weights the factory’s fate; the on-page cost is irrevocably paid at the click. Foreclosure is visible in the silence that settles around Elara, options narrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve regenerative silence—is signaled early and tightened by the hum’s intrusion. Escalation is one deepening: the breach forces her from witness to healer. Cost is the loss of absolute neutrality.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—reignite Leo’s wonder—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the eclipse provides the single, irreproducible window; Silas’s use of the vial forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—the death of wonder—intensifies as Alistair realizes the library is a tomb; the deepening is driven by his own probing and ends with irreversible renunciation. One clear tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—Eli’s moral gamble to redirect Lena’s life—tightens once when he commits to the lighthouse signal. Cost is legible: he forfeits anonymity and accepts lifelong solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—stop possession—tightens as each loop narrows options. Agency is intellectual; the cost is the spent pigment and Carver’s near-loss. One clear escalation beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim stolen childhood—tightens as each mapped memory raises the cost of exhaustion. One clear escalation: the mirrored world appears, foreclosing physical return. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates (sun-ray timing) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure accrues as each memory demands renunciation; the dominant stake is the refusal to fall—climaxing with the choice to fall—under coherent escalating stakes with perceptible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake: Inara’s defeat of numbness. Pressure tightens as Leo's playing achieves deeper vibration each week; recital forces final stance crystallization with visible cost. Causation holds; no coincidences resolve conflict. Slight taper toward epilogue—still tight.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“quarantine lie”—escalates steadily: pigeon’s revelation tightens options, Elara’s data transmission reweights consequences. No multiple reversals, but the single pivot feels earned and costly under the inferred causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Silas’s need to grasp why the scent unmans him—tightens when the vial’s memory forces a trade-off between protective forgetting and painful recollection. Agency and cost are legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—knowledge vs. world’s safety—is signaled early and tightened once: the impossible choice posed by the beings. Escalation is a single deepening that crystallizes cost; no reversals needed. Agency is renunciation with visible forfeiture of lifelong quest.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—answering the silence—tightens when the single note risks unleashing unbearable echoes; the bowl’s tremor marks visible price; no external coincidence resolves; agency is her endurance of the chorus.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: craft “fusion” or admit failure. Escalation is density-driven: each failed vial tightens the emotional noose until the grotto’s living static offers the single viable path. Cost is the irreversible recognition that she can only simulate empathy. Agency remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—Elias’s need to acknowledge Maeve’s labor—is signaled early and tightened when he risks exposing his own gratitude. One clear turn: the locket exchange crystallizes the shift from anonymity to recognition. Cost is present but soft; no tangible loss is dramatized. Coincidence of the misaddressed envelope slightly dilutes agency.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus solitude—is signaled early and escalates through the search; the missing final tag tightens pressure. Agency is collective but driven by Kaelin’s sculptor eye; the cost is the surrender of individual authorship to communal narrative. One meaningful deepening: the artist is revealed as “all of us,” foreclosing the lone-artist path. No reversals, but the pattern’s completion reweights stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preserve the life of echoes—escalates from detected flaw to potential extinction. One clear tightening: access to the forbidden spire narrows to the pendant test. The cost (loss of ancestral link) is declared but not yet viscerally felt on the page, keeping it below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—quantify ambiguous loss—tightens once: the glass-eye overlay forces Elara to abandon the quest for a numeric answer. The price is the surrender of her original goal, visible in the soft glow of the eyes left on the stone. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preservation vs. revelation—tightens once when Elara decides exposure outweighs secrecy. Escalation is causal: each discovery narrows her options until the final act forecloses her anonymity. Cost is legible in the last line’s sparrow chirp breaking the hush.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Aris master or join plant behavior—tightens when he disables control systems; storm pressure forces stance crystallization. Cost is visible: loss of predictive certainty, blank tablet. No reversals needed; single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: transmute memory into meaning without ash. Escalation is a single deepening: the discovery that meaning must be offered, not threshed. The exchange narrows options—both objects are surrendered—and the cost is legible in the receding pool. Agency remains with Kaelen; coincidence (storm exposure) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—protect the cave’s magic—tightens when the pilgrim’s theft attempt turns the cave’s song into a scream. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency under pressure; the cost is the cave’s near-silence and her own shaken certainty, though the price could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth versus civic amnesia—is signaled in paragraph one and escalates through each disclosure beat. The sabotage revelation narrows Elara’s options from “reveal” to “accuse,” with social ostracism the visible price. One meaningful tightening suffices; the crowd’s hush crystallizes the cost without external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—trade certainty for unspoken truths—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: city guides → vault reveals doors → library demands lifetime commitment. Cost is visible in the trembling step across the threshold. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—prove the universe is not chaotic noise—escalates nightly as whale memories intensify; agency culminates when Elias turns his transcription apparatus outward, tightening options and forcing a public act with visible cost. One decisive intensification is sufficient and well-tuned.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and tightened by each beat: storm intensifies, corridor mutinies, shard heats, wall thins. One meaningful escalation: the corridor’s spatial mutiny becomes the escape route, foreclosing eternal stasis. Cost is the amulet’s loss and exposure to raw cosmos. Agency is hers; luck complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding a “fair trade” for lifelong lies—tightens once when the passport reframes every prior move. Escalation is causal: discovery narrows her moral options to acceptance. Felt cost crystallizes in the final image; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—collecting textures of time—escalates through each refracted vision, tightening until dawn steadies the lamp and the visions cease. The cost is conceptual (solitude, endless return), but the tightening beat is more accumulative than decisively narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—archiving vanishings—tightens when the label converts random absences into deliberate erasure pattern. Tide-low moment at bedrock makes time an active antagonist; choice to carry the label into shipping office is a confrontation that costs anonymity and confirms the invisible war. Cost tracked on page.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—decode the Signal—tightens when the hum becomes an alien archive, forcing Elara to renounce debunking. The cost is the burden of final-days testimony; escalation is one decisive intensification under Accumulative lens. Agency is clear: her bow-stroke triggers the irreversible revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—navigate gentrification without losing soul—is signaled early and tightened when surveyors arrive tomorrow. Escalation is one meaningful deepening: from covert graffiti to public negotiation. Cost is explicit: the guild hall will never be “only ours” again. Agency remains Rio’s throughout; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the last silence—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through the literal countdown; the acid timer forecloses any redo. Escalation is accumulative: each grain lost, each shadow advancing, each mechanical vibration adds density rather than new external twists. The final cost is felt in the soles of her boots—she has the photo but must physically endure the first assault of noise. No reversal, but a meaningful deepening that reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the drone before the ship departs—is signaled early and tightened by the harbor clang. One meaningful escalation: realizing the drone must embrace, not avoid, turbulence. Cost is legible in Elara’s solitary stance and the fading hum; no reversals beyond scope.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the rivers’ source—escalates through one decisive tightening: the condensation map reveals an impossible location, forcing Elara onto the ice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing Elysium’s erasure—is signaled early and tightened through each fork-strike. The meaningful deepening occurs when the square’s “schism” answers back with shimmering echoes, narrowing options to acceptance of memory rather than full revival. The cost is felt in the final line’s renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—salvage the consciousness vs. survive the guardian—tightens when Elias chooses release over defense. One deepening: the guardian’s recognition reconfigures meaning without new external movement. Agency drives the climax; coincidence aids only when it amplifies stakes. A clear, felt price: he becomes custodian of an entire civilization, ending his solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is keeping final truth quiet before external discovery; single meaningful tightening occurs when spectral guardian dissolves after exacting confession; on-page cost is that eternal silence replaces lies.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“find a new way to honor the sea”—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accretive: each night’s dream-walk deepens the pattern until the final tide irrevocably rewrites the canyon. Cost is the irreversible alteration of ancestral stone and the communal loss of old stories.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring faith in her blood line through physical communion—tightens from journal hint to tactile excavation. One escalation only yet effective: collapse forced nature to stand in for missing technology, reweighting every prior root pulled. Cost is visceral yet understated; reader feels the irrevocable membership.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving human texture inside forged identity—tightens once: the woman’s “smell of old books” must survive digitization. Cost is the erasure of the chalk circle, a visible forfeiture that reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—thwart the coup—tightens when Kaelen arrives; Elara escalates by shifting from passive chart-keeper to active strategist. One decisive tightening: she reframes the problem from direct confrontation to subversion via the wine-loving captain. Cost is the heightened risk to herself.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding the pre-decisional moment—tightens when the window begins to write her unspoken letters. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens: each sensory layer raises the psychic cost. A visible price is paid when the messages dissolve at dawn, foreclosing the option to send them.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: can terror be given shape and thus loosened? Pressure tightens once—coral pattern moves from Kaito’s cast to surgical map, narrowing options to experimental surgery. Cost is the irreversible neural graft; price is legible in the “quiet silence” that replaces paralyzing charge. No false escalation; single deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming lost joy—tightens when the fresco fragment forces a pivot from new display to resurrection; the orchard’s phantom fruit is the earned, irreversible cost that forecloses the original plan.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—curiosity vs. certainty—tightens through each acoustic discovery; the final note forecloses the restoration path. Pressure is coherent but external (carver’s puzzle) more than internally compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate planetary pain or remain its failed witness—is signaled early and tightens when the lullaby offers a single, fragile alternative. Escalation is textural: each sensory layer (soil thrum, shell silence, off-key wind) increases density until the carve becomes inevitable. Protagonist agency drives the turn—she chooses to inscribe the treaty, paying with her lifelong vigil. Cost is felt: the ache softens, she loses her sleepless shield. Sufficient for high band, though only one decisive pressure spike.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the sound of forgotten names”—is signaled in opening paragraph and escalates when the bamboo’s crack produces a “faint sad whistling.” Micro beat tension: crack → widen → sad hiss. Culmination is not luck but agency; she inhales the echo and exhales it as internal light, tightening options into endurance with visible cost (“silver light faded”). Coincidence does not resolve—only the archived feeling resolves—and cost is paid in silence endured after the chime.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust after silence—is signaled early and tightens through the stalled translation. The final revelation acts as deepening, not reversal. No external force rescues; coincidence serves reveal but does not solve. One persistent cost: silence remains.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve historic chambers vs safety) tightens once the chain’s structural math trumps zero-sum choice; pressure peaks when mountain groans sync with breath-cycle clock. Cost of sleepless breath-cycle labour is visibly paid before Council acclimates.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve or release the lost songs—is signaled early and tightens once when the folio appears. The pressure deepens through Accumulative density rather than causal reversals, forcing a visible trade-off: safety versus transmission. The cost is felt when Argos disappears. One meaningful intensification suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the sacred thresholds—escalates as Elara deciphers the logbook and realizes the thresholds are temporal scars. One decisive tightening occurs when she chooses to cross the shimmering arch, trading safety for knowledge. The cost is the sensory assault of the memory-storm and the irreversible recognition of her father’s entrapment.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—belonging—tightens when failing instruments force a creative gamble; the polyp revelation escalates by redefining “landscape” from barrier to text.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—why memories vanish—tightens when the seed exposes the landslide. One decisive intensification occurs; cost is the knowledge that paths are forever buried, felt in Finn’s resolve to record the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can Silas manufacture wonder without exposing the machinery? Escalation is the tightening countdown to tide-trigger; the family’s arrival narrows options to “now or never.” Cost is the irreversible surrender of credit—he must remain invisible. One decisive turn suffices; coincidence (family path) complicates rather than rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: reclaim erased past through forbidden art. Escalation is accretive—each puncture deepens commitment and pain. No external reversals; pressure is coherent internal tide. Final tightening: moonstone droplet locks the dance forever, foreclosing return to sterile world.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—artist’s crisis of meaning vs. looming industrial change—sharpens in one beat: “window sat accusingly on his bench.” Escalation tightens when dawn deadline (“first true ray... broke the horizon”) forces irrevocable beveling choice. Cost is the very window that cannot now be altered; consequence is social as the new civic symbol will refract future eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to carry unearned grief forward—is signaled early and tightened once: from private contemplation to public testimony. The cost is the unending obligation to speak the smell of burning pine. No false escalation; pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—map hope—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accumulative: each balloon’s drift adds data until the cross-timeline overlap forces a conceptual leap. The tightening beat is the intersection of two symbols that rewrites the equation; cost is the exposure of her work to the world. No external antagonist is needed; pressure is epistemic and emotional.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—bearing witness to complicity—escalates from private curiosity to communal reckoning. The single decisive tightening occurs when Elara shifts from mapping to testifying, paying the cost of shared burden. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show possibility—is signaled early and tested by the ticking bell countdown. Escalation is one continuous tightening: mirage wavers → heartbeat anchor → mirror projection → dissolution under bell toll. Agency is Elara’s throughout; luck never rescues. The visible cost is her own life-force, altering tactics and foreclosing further attempts tonight.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ending the forever war—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single tightening: the delegates’ wary arrival → guided compromise → handshake. Agency lies in Elara’s ritual stillness and precise notation; the cost is the unspoken knowledge that “for now” is fragile. No reversals, but the narrowing of options from open hostility to tentative accord is legible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will continue to curate extinction or release its echo—is signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: storm arrives, drought ends, forcing the tightening choice. Agency is renunciation with felt cost. No coincidences resolve; the storm complicates, not rescues. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single dominant stake: break harmonic conformity. Each untangled thread intensifies pressure; Elara’s bodily conduit role is visceral (“shuddered through her own body”). Agency drives reversal; price is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to tell truth ethically—tightens once: from pristine transcription to messy, unforgettable performance. The reversal is a single decisive escalation that forecloses the old method; cost is the destruction of her manuscripts and public exposure of private conflict. Pressure stays coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—honor two vanishing histories—does crystallize but never faces external adversary or dwindling clock; the tension is elegiac rather than escalatory. One deepening beat: hawk predation inserts mortal cost mid-stream. Price remains conceptual rather than tactic-altering.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the choir’s memory—is signaled early and tightened when the card crumbles; the rope intervention narrows options to one last chance. Cost is felt in the wax’s fragility and the irreversible unweaving of the relic. Agency drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—escalates through dream-shard density and storm pressure until the seal’s breaking forces a stance crystallization. Cost is the AI’s entire epistemic framework; no coincidence resolves the conflict. One meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—seal covenant or fail—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each failed formula drains resolve until surrender becomes the single viable tactic. Cost is felt in the “foreign” frustration and the irreversible abandonment of empirical certainty. No coincidence; failure is authored by her own limits.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    A single, coherent stake: teach resentment to release its bitter hold before reality fully tears apart. Pressure escalates from mute box to glitching air and ghostly melody under situational force; final harmonic shift makes the cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture or coexist with the dream—is signaled early and tightened through each calibration of the sextant. Final breath-sync is the decisive narrowing of options; cost is the irreversible overlay of two realities. No extraneous reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—save the orchard—tightens when the wreckers’ arrival becomes imminent. Escalation is driven by Elara’s choice to leave the rafters and offer the apple; the delay is earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—rescue Elara and reach the Library—tightens through each silent step. Agency is exercised in the breath-negotiation that forecloses violence. One deepening turn suffices; cost is felt in the Library’s emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recover Idris—tightens when the journal reframes the quest from retrieval to stewardship. One decisive deepening: the ship is not prison but vessel. Price is paid on-page: she forgoes escape to become keeper of forgotten names.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“translate confusion into clarity”—is signaled early and tightened when the door appears; the single reversal (rope mis-braided) forces a trade-off between safety and duty, with the cost of vertigo and later the quiet loss of the impossible doorway.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore silence—is signaled early and tightened when Kaelyn redirects the stone’s scream. The cost is legible: her exhaustion and the irreversible transformation of violent energy into stillness. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake: prove meaning within total collapse. Tightening is one long crescendo: weeks of calculation narrow the sky to one aberrant star-path, then the beam laced into darkness makes the cost legible—Elara remains alone, but her signal has left her isolation irreversible. No coincidence resolves the conflict; coincidence only initiates it.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—completing the final record while facing erasure—tightens once when fog solidifies. Agency is renunciation rather than reversal; cost is the irreversible loss of audience, legible in the last shadow measurement.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—defy hopelessness—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each bloom; the mosaic command escalates the task from display to dialogue with history.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preservation of generational knowledge versus personal discovery—tightens when the cicada reappears, forcing Ayla to test her tangential method on Kael. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals; the cost is the emotional risk of reopening dialogue after harsh words.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—survive vs. transcend fear—tightens meaningfully during the inversion window; Elara’s panic narrows options until she chooses to plant the doll, renouncing her former refuge. The only missing leg is an on-page tangible loss other than the hour itself.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restoring a comforting silence—is signaled early and tightened through the rising drone. The decisive catalytic strike narrows options and transmutes noise into hush; cost is the endless itinerancy Elara embraces. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; one more tangible forfeiture (a cracked vial, a strained muscle) would lift it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Unclaimed throne frames all motivation and forces physical sally through lethal jungle; orchard defense system tightens stakes until celestial route unlocks. Escalation is linear rather than multi-reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“translate pressure or be consumed”—is signaled early and tightened once: from personal survival to offering the bolt. Escalation is causal and legible; agency remains with Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—uncover the family lie—escalates through tightening sensory interference: the hiss thickens to hum then voice. The single, irreversible moment of hearing covertly re-weights the entire estate and Lysander’s future. A slightly nebulous quantification of what “lying built” keeps it a hair below elite escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake: liberation from accumulated guilt. Pressure tightens by causal linkage—each step closer to the marionette raises the price of either clutching or releasing hope. The unsnap costs him his knighthood in one move; no coincidence intervenes.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will remain emotionally sealed or risk hope—is signaled early and tightened once by the letter’s revelation. The single deepening (reading the soldier’s plea) narrows his options: he must now act as witness, not mere clerk.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering true memory against Regime amnesia—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is one deepening: from failed contact to map to archive, each step narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing the prophecy’s chill decay—is signaled early and tightened through the musical duel.

One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode the leaves—tightens when reverence for one speck unlocks the entire archive. One decisive intensification: frozen leaves reveal luminous script. Cost is the loss of separateness, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—renouncing certainty in planning—tightens the moment she swaps “detailed itinerary” for “tools to improvise.” Escalation is single-point but sufficient: the still water, then the roar; the frozen hands, then the shuddering tick. Cost—the lost precision, the numb fingers—is visible and forecloses the “perfect solution” forever.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s self-redemption—tightens when the water path forces a choice: open the furnace or remain in regret. Escalation is causal and single-turn; the cost is the irreversible days lost and the boy’s endured darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—replace anguish with laughter—is signaled early and tightened once: Kael’s confession raises the cost of failure, and Elara’s single-string pluck forecloses the option to keep the laughter for herself.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—is signaled early and tightened when the lens reveals the hidden letter. One meaningful deepening: the secondary painting inside the painting narrows options to a single brick.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: witness the ghost’s untold heroism. Pressure tightens once—Leo’s rule against engagement collides with the girl’s pointing finger and the revealed mainspring.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—compress eternity into one meaningful moment—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is a single, decisive intensification: the whisper’s release destabilizes the perfect system and forces the rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove the civilization’s artistic soul—tightens once when the poem becomes the proof, foreclosing all other evidentiary paths. Agency is Kaelen’s alone; cost is the irreversible solitude that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Coherent pressure mounts: from ritual preparation to final immersion, each deepening sharpens the single stake—surrender to ultimate silence. The one decisive narrowing (compass points down, path sealed) is agency-driven and carries visible ontological cost.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—listen vs. alarm—tightens once when barometric data screams yet silence prevails. Escalation is causal: conflicting readings → glue dries → rope tremor → bell tolls. The price is the un-pulled switch and the moral burden of trusting one’s ear over the crowd’s safety.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake reframes observation: from tracking to witnessing; tension tightens when AI threatens quarantine, forcing a choice of sharing rather than hiding—cost is human surrender of private understanding to machine. escalation is single, meaningful, legible.

    Single escalating stake crystallizes early (banishing of shared space → killing silence). Agency chain: Aris internalizes town fear → conceives quiet micro-rebellion → orchestrates stone signal each beat narrowing exposure-risk. Cost legible: “if the Director notices…” implicit, yet pressing at closing glow.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freedom versus duty—signals early and tightens once: the island’s appearance forces the choice to row or remain.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to carry unendurable grief—tightens when the bouquet’s decay forces Elias to abandon the safety of whittled silence.

No reversals beyond this, but the shift is decisive and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: dissolve the boundary between art and artist or remain exiled from authentic creation. Escalation is textural—the hum deepens, the light thickens—until the final fusion forecloses her old method of translation. Cost is the permanent internalization of the song; she leaves lighter yet forever altered. Agency drives every beat: she chooses permeation over touch, composition over speech.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    Precise single stake: “awakening worth the price of sight.” Pressure tightens once—the offer of eyes—and the cost is the loss of ordinary perception. One meaningful deepening; no reversals but no slack.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering “texture of connection”—is signaled early and tightened when she risks inserting her living voice.

Agency drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether grief will remain void or become generative—is signaled early and tightened through each origami clue. The telescope beat forces a trade-off: accept pain as material or stay paralyzed. Cost is visible in the phrase “ashes of the old.”

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Primary stake—proving the collapse is a correction—escalates through each data-point Elara takes; cooperation fixes the leak while enacting that correction. Stakes stay visceral, no coincidence resolves; choice yields a visible price of sweat, proximity, time.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pursuit of forbidden knowledge escalates from curiosity to seductive annihilation; one irreversible Yes/No at the pagoda crystallizes the dominant stake with visible existential cost.

One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias buries the tail-tip: the symbolic cost of letting go becomes literal soil-work.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: learn the true story in her scar. Pressure tightens once: the tunnel reveals the miracle is gone, forcing re-evaluation. Cost is visceral (pain, shaking) and conceptual (absence). Agency is attention that forecloses the old reading. No external antagonist needed; coincidence (displaced miracle) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—tightens when Elara realizes archiving is not loss but withholding. One decisive turn: she loads the reel, releasing the love at the cost of private possession. Pressure grows under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing creativity—escalates via aurora’s appearance and meteor navigation; one tightening beat aligns the device. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete, keeping it from the 8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—archive’s fragile lullaby memory—escalates from volatile threat to stabilized ember via causal pressure (harmonized probability, not brute force). One tightening suffices; cost visible as quiet extinct-forest song integrated into dune.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover the wild frontier of your mind”—is signaled early and tightens when the forest’s hum becomes a “plea.” One decisive turn: Silas gives up the gear to stop the unraveling. Cost is visible (empty palm) and alters his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—claiming latent courage—is signaled early and tested by the toll demand. Escalation is quiet but causal: story payment → stamp receipt → recognition that courage was already owned. Cost is the irreversible crossing; no external reversals, but internal pressure tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Conflict pivots on one stake—safety bought with silence—and escalates via Leo’s increasing internal resistance; each stair-grip tightens stakes until quiet resistance shatters the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—legacy theft—tightens once when the pretender appears and the rune is activated. Escalation is causal: discovery → inscription → confrontation → reversal, each step narrowing options and exacting the cost of exposure and ruin.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—rekindling hope via ancient power—tightens once when Elara steps into the circle.

No reversals needed; one meaningful turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—evolve tradition vs. preserve it—tightens once when Elara chooses to unseal. The cost is conceptual but legible: she forfeits the safety of orthodoxy. One meaningful deepening suffices for the word count; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will she drown in memory or find a way to thaw—is signaled early and tightened once by the false-thunder trigger. The somatic counter-moves narrow options and carry visible bodily cost. No coincidence resolves; the storm only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single dominant stake—escape before crushing knowledge—and each pulse shrinks the cone of safety, deepening cost. Rhetorical questions are externalized fear-ticks but agency remains: she edits existence thread-by-thread. No coincidence resolves; final step onto stone is paid for by irreplaceable mercury spent. Escalation is cumulative, pattern-driven until foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—"why time slows in crisis"—is signaled early and escalates through intensified ink vision; agency shapes the deepening: protagonist actively dilutes ink to force further revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs release truth—signals in paragraph two. Escalation is causal: letter discovery narrows options until only broadcast remains.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the goddess’s echo—signaled early. Escalation is one deepening: from gentle hum to feral lullaby, forcing Nereus to adapt via harmonic counter-song.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. profitable lie—is signaled immediately and tightened by the proof-by-contradiction exercise that exposes catastrophic fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—repair the past to earn an encore—is signaled early and tightened by each echo-lattice she weaves.

Cost is felt in the searing memory of betrayal and the garden’s absorbed glow.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is the gaping memory hole; pressure tightens in one continuous lift: pill choice → tactile retrieval → re-mapping lost love into light. Agency is preserved at every turn; cost is the permanent substitution of pill-illuminated memory for the fragile original, signaled on page.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether Elias will risk his remnant life for a stranger’s warning—escalates cleanly. The snow-cipher’s imminent erasure tightens the screw; vouchsafing is the irreversible act that forecloses anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—why decay spares this place—tightens as Elara’s acts of kindness unlock visions, narrowing her options from observer to guardian. Each offering raises the cost of withdrawal.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: transform communal gloom into shared light. Pressure escalates via rhythmic aeration and successive mirror flashes; each act narrows the option to retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into sustainable independence—tightens when the stone’s hum forces a stance: coexist or shatter. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and accumulative. One meaningful deepening: the sundial’s window redefines “independence” from erasure to bearing witness. Cost is the lifelong companionship of ghosts.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—clearing the ancestor’s name—escalates through decoding pressure and culminates in the irreversible act of pulling the nail. One meaningful tightening suffices; the cost is the dread she absorbs and the mandate she inherits.

    The dominant stake—decode the inscriptions to honor her mentor and avert panic—is signaled early.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the intersection—tightens via the glowing path and the self-inflicted cut. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens; the cost is visible yet slightly diffuse, keeping it just below the 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—finding a purpose after public failure—tightens when the letters reveal Leo’s parallel crisis and unfulfilled purpose. The escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals: discovery of the letters reweights the meaning of Silas’s cataloguing work. Cost is the felt absence of Leo and the unborn child, visible in the final resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—understand transition to reach Elara—tightens when decoding fails and the seed refuses force. The single reversal (release vs. command) narrows options and carries visible emotional cost. Escalation is modest but coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can one vessel hold multitudes without rupture—signaled early and tightened by the moon-phase apex. Escalation is accretive: identities swirl, cocoon, then flood.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—returning abandoned hope—tightens when Elara realizes the pearl is an invitation, not an artifact. One decisive turn: she drives to the woman instead of cataloguing the pearl. Cost is the exposure of her covert mission and the emotional toll of witnessing reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“snatch one brilliant note before the eternal quiet”—is coherently escalated by successive compressions: bodily anointment → emerald reading → threshold crossing; the final infusion tightens options and pays an unambiguous price (Elara’s temporary death-state).

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the cycle—tightens when the water refuses to clear. One deepening: ancestral memory raises the cost of stewardship. Agency is Elara’s decision to stir with inherited intention; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether Elara will sell absolution—tightens when she sees the client’s uncertainty. One decisive tightening: she asks the mirror question instead of delivering the purchased certainty. Cost is the lost contract and the exposed self-doubt.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—true presence versus vanishing—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Elara’s translucence forces Kaelen to re-evaluate solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—discover the color of sound—tightens when the green-gold glow reframes it as love’s light. One meaningful deepening: the vow reweights the quest from auditory to luminous.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—single frequency to seed next universe—escalates via prophecy that retroactively threatens stagnation; the tightening choice between peace and struggle narrows to the obsidian’s cut. Cost is visceral and conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—city-wide winter—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the canal trickle resumes. Escalation is accumulative: each failed thud → dull wobble → calibrated drip narrows options to patience or surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to erase or preserve memory—tightens once when Elias swaps destruction for witness. Agency drives the shift; cost is the forfeiture of solitary control. Pressure accumulates via photograph trail and looming bulldozers.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve Elias’s trust—drives every beat. Escalation is causal: signal → locked system → hidden key → irreversible launch. One tightening suffices; the lever pull visibly forecloses the safety of the arbor. Cost is the loss of her post and exposure to planetary storm.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—defeat numbness—is signaled early and tightened each time Kaelen chooses to endure the pain of opposite emotions; the cost is the irrevocable loss of emotional insulation.

    Dominant stake—restore laughter—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is textural: each sonic layer intensifies grief’s weight until the silence reframes it. Cost is the spent fuel and Silas’s broken voice; laughter’s return is earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: preserve the garden vs. escape home. One tightening: seam appears → choice to mend, not cross. Cost is explicit—pendant extinguished, homesickness prolonged. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“interrupt a stifling destiny”—is announced early and tightened with each refusal. Escalation pivots on creative destruction: each failed “successive approximation” raises the cost, culminating in the irreversible coruscating unmaking. Agency remains causal; no outsider interferes; coincidence complicates only by producing more dangerous energy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled early and tightened by the act of dampening all noise. The visible price is the silence that births the star; agency drives escalation under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure ratchets through tide and tunnel; the codex discovery narrows options, forcing a crawl and risky translation. External ocean return provides escalating deadline; protagonist agency is to witness, not escape—an earned, cost-bearing stance.

    Dominant stake is signaled early: reassemble Julian and extract post-mortem wisdom.

Agency is continuous motion of the shard; no outside coincidence dilutes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve a dead language—tightens when success amplifies loss. The flock-grammar discovery is the single meaningful escalation that reweights options; afterward, no escape remains.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—keep the promise alive—tightens when the drone’s searchlight pins Kael; the option to flee is foreclosed by his refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Single stake—locate pre-narrative space—tightens via escalating sensory density; the shift from browsing murmur to hushed shimmer narrows options. Cost is atmospheric rather than personal, keeping pressure legible but not viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightened once when Elara realizes the palette can paint light itself. Escalation is a single, decisive intensification under Accumulative lens; cost is the dream’s departure from the sky after capture.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing the idea trapped by fear—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the story of sacrificed love collapses the client’s fixed past.

No reversals are needed; the pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes—the theft of childhood wonder—are signaled early and tighten when physical search stalls; agency shifts from brute searching to deciphering star geometries. One meaningful deepening (underwater descent after celestial map) narrows options. Cost would feel sharper if memory recovery inflicted immediate post-dive physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: Elias’s freedom hinges on forging a successor. Pressure escalates through failed annotations, the apprentice’s despair, and the final breakthrough that narrows Elias’s options to leave or stay forever.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder—tightens once: rational grafts fail, so she risks her own essence. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; the cost is her draining vitality, legible in “effort was immense…weakened.” No false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“quiet a drowned spirit without merely patching clay”—intensifies knot by knot; each loosened loop raises literal and moral cost. Escalation is textured (pressure → chill → memory flood) rather than crescendo, then lands at crystallized absolution. One pacing wobble late-middle when ghost memory floods in a single summary block caps 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—interpret silence—tightens when the shadow discrepancy forces a choice: force or empathize. The whispered word is the decisive, costly act that forecloses brute-force entry. Escalation is single but sufficient; cost is the surrender of control.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—understand letting go—tightens from intellectual puzzle to embodied acceptance. One meaningful deepening: the librarian’s note reweights the vacuum concept, the globe’s fracture forces Elara to enact it. Escalation is accumulative: each recovered object raises the cost of clinging until the final image suspends the glitter in perfect release. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates (desk collapse) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—free the ghost—tightens once when the bolt plate proves to be the key. Escalation is causal: each beat narrows options until the lightning-thunder window. Cost is visible in the spent graffiti and Elara’s resumed solitude. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs. share Rhys’s hidden joy—tightens once when Elara decodes the diary. Agency drives the escalation; coincidence is absent. The cost is the private burden she now carries. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove emptiness remembers—tightens when the tether snaps and ascent becomes irreversible. One meaningful deepening: clouds vanish, replaced by contrails of pure experience, reweighting the stake from observation to participation. Agency is her continued recording under existential threat; cost is permanent separation from earth. Pressure escalates via altitude and thinning air, coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the sky’s image before annihilation—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each discovery (coin map, wax key, moon-pigment) narrows options and raises cost. The final act (hand-print) forecloses escape; the price is the irreversible loss of the building and her own exit window. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (demolition schedule) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—charting the next great discovery—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the void’s coordinates lock in. The single meaningful turn is the moment the aurora becomes visible, foreclosing retreat or sharing. Cost is legible: lifelong solitude accepted in the final beat. Pressure escalates under the causal lens; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“a stutter in time itself”—is signaled early and tightened by each failed gear until the moonlight vial offers the single viable path. Agency remains high; coincidence never rescues. Cost is conceptual (time restored, personal solitude intact) rather than visceral, slightly softening the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—save the groves—signaled in paragraph 2; pressure tightens when instructions fail and faith frays. The map and skywatch constitute one decisive escalation that reframes effort as partnership. Cost is visible in Aelia’s exhaustion and the settlers’ prior despair. Agency remains collective, but Aelia’s orchestration drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to prolong or release existence—is signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when the puppet head is revealed as intentional sabotage. Escalation is one deepening: the jam becomes a plea, forcing Elara’s stance crystallization. Cost is the irreversible stilling of the Heart. Agency remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    Early stake—getting the traveler out before frost—is simple, pressing, and reiterated. Mid-scene the pressure tightens: finding the blueprint raises possibility of mastering the labyrinth, risking exposure of secret. Single decisive turn is using the nut/key once he understands it will change paths forever. Cost is conceptual (loss of ancient secrecy) rather than visceral, limiting reach into high 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translating separation into connection—tightens once via the foam insight. Escalation is a single intensification under Accumulative lens; the cost is conceptual (abandoning rigid design) and relational (facing Lena). No redundant reversals; pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to test her method—tightens when the client’s parole threatens revocation. The single deepening beat (filament carving the void) narrows options and exacts a visible price (spent moonlight, client’s altered form). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence is absent. Cost is felt, not merely declared.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preventing centuries of remorse from poisoning the world—is signaled early and escalates through sensory intensification. One decisive tightening: contact with the oyster floods Kaelen with “crippling grief,” forcing the choice to subsume rather than flee. Cost is visceral—“exhausted and hollowed out.” Agency drives every beat; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—mending fractured city conversation—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is one deepening: the clock’s failure → her tactile repair → communal song. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates (the weight was stuck, not random). Felt cost: open-ended stewardship accepted in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—inherit and redeem the murdered dream—tightens when Elara confronts the engineer’s despair; the cost is the psychic flood she must now carry. One clear escalation beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    Central conflict—retrieval before gravity rights itself—is stated early, stakes time-locked. Escalation pivots on environmental constraint rather than layered reversals: each corridor turn under altered orientation narrows Elara’s physical and interpretive space. One meaningful tightening occurs when gravity weakens and seeds relinquish, narrowing to the singular beat: claim or lose. Cost is implicit in lifelong vigilance yet registers as foreboding rather than visceral paid price, holding just shy of 8.8 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore sound—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: failure of first sculpture → crack analysis → redesign → first note. One meaningful tightening: realization that music must be “invited,” not forced. Cost is felt in slow labor and the “profound despair” before breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the elegant move that heals”—is signaled early and tightened when Kael risks his only talisman on a stranger. The tapping coordinate burst is a clear reversal that forecloses the option to walk away. Cost is legible: the stable chord locks him back into human entanglement. One meaningful escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: recover Grandfather’s empathy through sound. Pressure tightens from unlocking the clasp (one focused, causal beat) to realizing fireworks are part of the catalog. Cost is felt: purity of silence must accept noise, narrowing her future practice. Escalation is a deepening rather than a chain of turns; sufficient for this length under an accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—find the Grovetree’s resilience—tightens when gravity inversion exposes the roots, making vulnerability visceral. Agency is high: Kaelen inverts flight path, enters cave, chooses guardianship. One credible loss: the fleeting access to time-memory ends when gravity normalizes. Coincidence (inversion) complicates but does not resolve; the final choice is hers. Pressure escalates under Situational lens: external anomaly forces stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent a city-scale recreation of the Arcadia crash—is signaled by the patch and escalates through each beat. The tightening occurs when Vale realizes the port is being “pulled into being” and chooses to transmit countermeasures; the cost is her exposure to the nascent event. Pressure is coherent and causally driven.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—harvest insight from failure—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses to study rather than repair. The cost is visible: she seals the path behind her, accepting irreversible loss. One meaningful deepening suffices; no external antagonist needed. Agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake: the cost of understanding emotion mathematically. Escalation is density increase—each empathy swap drains agency further. Final turn costs belief that data can resolve her solitude; renunciation lands on page with physical fragment drop and tears. Stake remains visceral and narrow throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will Silas find wonder or remain a passive courier—tightens when the hermit rejects the box. The pendant’s activation forces a decisive stance; the crystalline bloom is the irreversible price. Escalation is causal and single-cycle, sufficient for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—validate heretical belief—tightens when prism yields null and frost yields cosmic indifference. One decisive deepening: realization that objects store “truth” not “emotion” forecloses prior path. Cost is the collapse of her life’s assumption, legible in the smile that accepts vaster reality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—heal the raveling silence—tightens once when Elara realizes the loom itself must be sacrificed. Escalation is causal: nightly unraveling → puzzle insight → bead flare → loom release. Price is visible and irreversible; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—coax resilience from rubble—escalates through each beat: collapse, descent, memory barter, forging. The tightening choice is the memory-for-knowledge trade, foreclosing her old self with visible cost. Pressure remains coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—discover why Aris vanished—tightens when the vision reveals he sacrificed his timeline. One clear escalation: the shard shifts from compass to anchor, narrowing Elara’s options to pursuit. Cost is visible in her gasp and the “crushing” weight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the archive—intensifies as each groan lowers temperature and threatens to erase the private light. Escalation occurs through one decisive deepening: the haunting fixates on the letters. Cost is visible—risk of physical safety and forfeiture of remaining night rest—yet the ghost’s rapid retreat tempers the price felt at the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—why some magnetize stories—tightens when Hira realizes he is living another’s narrative pulse. One clear escalation: the wing’s illumination forecloses the option of remaining a passive observer. Cost is the loss of narrative anonymity; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand the trees—tightens when the sextant’s vision redefines the labyrinth’s purpose. The pressure deepens via the moonlit repair and the arboreal memory, forcing her stance crystallization. Cost is felt in her relinquishing the tool and her prior worldview. No external antagonist needed; the maze itself supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—realm’s extinction—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is the gradual reassembly of song; each recovered note tightens the communal bond and brightens the ghost-sun. Cost is collective exhaustion and the risk of remembering wrongly, visible in tentative voices.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder against creeping gray—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single deepening: the uncloaking reveals the battle is already being fought in hiding, tightening Elara’s task from lone planting to shared guardianship. Cost is legible: the absolution is “tenuous,” reliant on continued belief. Agency remains hers; she chooses to stay and tend.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    A single dominant stake—retrieve meaning before oblivion—is clear early, and the slide discovery delivers a visible pivot. However, the tightening is more intellectual revelation than visceral forfeiture; the price paid is oblique (slide depletion) and doesn’t recalibrate Elara’s next action on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of trust breaking—escalates through narrowing options: Curator’s one-charge limit, Silas’s evasions, the dawn deadline. The tightening is Elara’s realization the sound is internal; agency drives the final click with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—why weather is carried—tightens when the golden-calm woman reveals the cost of stewardship. Escalation is one sustained deepening rather than multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. The price is legible: Kael abandons solitary certainty for collective guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: whether Alistair will remain a copyist or pay the price to become an originator. Escalates from mundane commission to irreversible act— tearing the portrait— which forecloses the replication path. Cost material: shredding his own early work severs past income/identity, felt on the page. Agency sustains; no deus ex machina.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth as survival—tightens when each lie physically weakens Elara. The plumber’s admission is the single pressure spike that enables the final choice; cost is visible in her prior collapse. No second reversal, but the deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens once: the sour note from dull ice → kinetic re-tuning → restored valley chord forms a trackable density climb and narrows options decisively at the final placement of the fragment.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake—resolve inner static before catatonia—signaled early. Escalation is causal: storm → flux → box → compression → burn. One meaningful tightening when the nucleus threatens release, forcing the controlled burn; cost is the rose’s irreversible color shift and K-27’s altered self-song.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving listening heals—is tested when Elara must decide between exposing Leo or simply witnessing. One meaningful tightening: the moment she places the locket on the blanket and chooses silence. Pressure escalates through accumulating fragments of Anya’s story until the final, irreversible act of listening forecloses any further search.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—turn solitude into unassailable strength—tightens when the dice pose the void question, forcing Elara to confront meaninglessness. One decisive turn: she encrypts the fear itself, which then becomes the final key. Cost is visible when the Archive’s protective barrier is irrevocably broken.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (recover a single erased love) are singular, personal, and tighten under physical gravity that escalates with descent. Agency is continuous; every choice (drink, read, descend, pick) pays visible cost. No reversal is needed—only deepening—until the last crack of salt delivers the decisive loss and the gift.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mute the prophecy—escalates steadily without antagonist: each silent exhalation narrows her stamina margin; the tightening climaxes when her will must outweigh cosmic frequency.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—learning the building’s language—tightens when the tutor’s identity collapses into the very grammar she sought. One decisive intensification: the meteor shower strips the agreed-upon lies, forcing her to speak the next sentence alone. Cost is the custodian’s dissolution and her solitary succession.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep memory sealed—tightens with each pulse of the shell; the Archive’s resonance forces the irreversible trade-off. Cost is the felt chill of seawater and the audible “Live,” not abstract loss.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—“rescue the condemned regiment without igniting suspicion”—tightens through each beat: the thorn’s limited reach, Varos’s arrival, the Queen’s hidden tell, the key. One clear escalation: discovery of the Queen’s complicity widens the moral field from lone betrayal to systemic absolution, a felt price now shared rather than privatized.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—salvaging a single untainted truth—escalates through each dream fragment until the Reykjavik window forecloses all other readings. The cost is the purser’s obliterated lie, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting the hidden pattern—signaled early; single deepening when Ren chooses to whistle and later releases the fly narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: one fly saved, countless others still at risk, human lights remain. No escalation curve beyond the one cadence shift, sufficient for 600-word scope.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—“truth vs. survival”—is anchored early and tightened through the discovery that revelation equals destruction. Pressure reaches crystallization when Elara realizes weaponization risk and chooses silence during the storm, narrowing her former investigative options. Legible, felt cost is present in leaving the orchard a secret.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth versus control—is signaled early and tightened once: the Aerie’s offer versus the prophet’s path. Cassian’s agency drives the escalation; his choice to amplify the prophet forecloses return to the Aerie. Cost is the storm’s energy drain and the risk of total failure. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single clear stake—prevent the erasure of one grandmother’s song—intensifies when Orin discovers the box does not play, forcing redefinition of what counts as preservation. Cost is legible: months of visits, the fragility of Miss Elara’s voice, the final sealed moment of sound.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the artifact by stilling the ice—is signaled early and escalates through one decisive tightening: the shift from aggressive command to harmonic joining. The price is the sunset’s death and the tower’s strain. Agency drives every beat; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    A single dominant stake—will the moons unyoke the sanctuary tonight?—tightens through incremental celestial movement and magnetic hum. The protagonist’s agency is attentive witness, a credible stance crystallized at climax. Cost is felt in her relinquished restlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. systemic culpability—is signaled early and tightens when the lantern’s memories force Elara to abandon empirical detachment. One decisive intensification: the psychic fusion reweights the stakes from “accident” to “preventable by society.” Cost is legible in her altered mission.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: can Vale fulfill the prisoner’s dying wish? Pressure rises once—diagnosis reveals a single, fixable flaw. Cost is the prisoner’s life already gone and Vale’s lingering inadequacy. Agency is mostly Liam’s; Vale watches, so the tightening is vicarious. Still, the beat narrows options to “repair or abandon,” and the repair succeeds with visible emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes narrow from “find a bell tone” to “rewrite the world’s code”; each tighter lens raises physical risk plus existential cost. Evolution itself is placed under decision ethical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.1)
    Pressure intensifies neatly as each new number re-opens a sealed grief, culminating in the encryption break and the whispered purge that reframes the entire archive as predatory. The felt cost—the archive itself becoming a chorus for lost minds—is palpable at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—prevent the avalanche—signaled in Kael’s first plea. Escalation tightens once: from passive watch to active mobilization, with the cost of Elara’s altered oath. Agency is hers: she chooses to leave the orchard, weave the visions, and lead the village. No coincidence resolves; the avalanche is diverted by human effort.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“learn the sound of approaching endings”—is signaled early and tightened by each beat: parasol tip (small ending), blizzard (large ending). Agency is attention/renunciation rather than overt action; cost is conceptual but legible in the final silence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is alignment of self with impermanent labor of the vineyard vs the burned promise. Pressure tightens once: the act of re-reading the letter triggers a single deepening reframing, not new reversals. Agency drives the escalation; cost is letting go of the physical relic. No external antagonist—internal mismatch is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve whispered wisdom against single deafening truth—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: prophet’s arrival threatens to collapse the clearing; Line Walker’s agency (dune shift + sealing) forecloses the prophet’s path at visible cost (loss of the clearing itself). No coincidence resolves; all turns stem from protagonist tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: transforming communal pain into shared beauty. Pressure tightens as Elara deciphers the photographs and then physically returns the case; the final act forecloses her solitary quest by making it collective. Cost is communal, not personal, slightly blunting the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prove language still grows—tightens once when Elara decides to testify; cost is the exposure of her lifelong isolation to an indifferent world. Pressure escalates via the crystal’s revelation rather than external opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—“sound of growing older”—is signaled early and re-weighted when the tape delivers the hum, creating a decisive intensification under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in the tidal longing that physically weighs on Elara; no multiple reversals needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—preserve ephemeral beauty at any cost—compressed to seconds. Escalation: seismic degradation tightens temporal vise; one irreversible creative choice is forced (camera armed, no escape). Agency: her decision to halt the clock rather than evacuate forecloses future life with visible cosmic sacrifice; no lucky rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—delivering a “flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara decides to hide the results. Escalation is causal: each musical choice narrows her remaining options until the final reunification. Cost is felt in her withheld truth and the irreversible moment of death. One decisive turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—where shadows invert—intensifies as Elara pieces fragments under a diminishing clock toward noon. A single decisive tightening occurs when her reconstructed loop forces the automaton’s final projection, re-weighting prior stakes from “find a place” to “understand the mending process.”

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Leo—signaled on page one. Escalation: discovery of tooth narrows method to Faerie trespass; setting Leo’s bone is the tightening act that forces immediate truce. Cost is visible (broken arm, Faerie attention). No reversal beyond the initial portal crossing, but the single deepening is sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to share light without fire—tightens through the polishing sequence; each pass narrows the option of spectacle and deepens the cost of quiet dissemination. One meaningful intensification: the moment the glass begins to breathe reconfigures tactics and forecloses the torch-bearing path.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stake (reclaim agency over words once viral) tightens after Kael reminds her the world has moved on, forcing the pendant proffer. Escalation is one-step but meaningful; viral shame recedes as living memory emerges, carrying clear relational cost. Agency remains Elara’s; no outside rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding a story worth finishing—is signaled early and tightened when Kaelen realizes he must live, not curate, hope. The woman’s cameo forces a trade-off: abandon the safety of observation for the risk of authorship. Cost is legible in the shell’s relinquishment. One escalation beat suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the Heart-Vine—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: silence → song → light. Agency is Elara’s decision to sing, but the moon provides the decisive energy; cost is off-loaded to the celestial rather than extracted from her.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: to render her mother’s death into a permanent, readable artifact. Escalation is not explosive but accumulative—each pattern tightens the emotional vise until the starlight flares and the cold fire seals the map. The cost is explicit: the alembic goes dark, the flash-paper is gone, her future cartographies are foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the mountain’s heart-sound—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened through each beat. The single decisive turn is the moment she slots the resonator; the cost is the irreversible transfer of wonder from her immediate senses to the stone. Pressure escalates because each deduction narrows her options until only perfect tuning will suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—collect the new sorrow without being destroyed—is signaled early and tightened when the grief begins to harden. Escalation is driven by Elara’s misalignment and subsequent surrender; the calcification narrows her options to endure or be encased. Cost is palpable: her hands are now gloved in mineralized grief. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—contain grief within art—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single deepening: the shift from “monument to the beast” to the negative-space hand narrows options and raises emotional cost. Agency is renunciation: she stops when the kettle clicks, paying the price of an unfinished surface to preserve the lesson. Cost is visible in the rough wood and the deliberate cessation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reckoning with wasted ambition—tightens with each spectral click until the last image forecloses nostalgia as refuge. Pressure is accumulative, not causal, but the deepening regret is legible and costly. One meaningful intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting the station’s potential—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes the capacitors’ charge is finite. The single reversal (dead maze → living refuge) is earned by her redirected-flow engineering, not luck. Cost is visible: once the power is spent, no second resurrection is possible. Pressure escalates under Causal lens; no coincidences resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reconciling abandoned dream—tightens once: the bear’s arrival forces a choice between clinging to silence or releasing the score. Escalation is accretive, not causal, but the cost is legible when the notes leave her forever. No coincidence resolves; the bear complicates, then accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—understanding truth—escalates cleanly from folktale myth to personal revelation. One credible tightening: tapestry reconfigures identity. Stakes concrete but mostly interior, lacking overt opposition beyond self-deception.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent extinction of knot-memory—escalates via decoding constraints; each twist lopping a live option. Causality intact: Hemlock’s knot rewords destiny, not deus-ex-fog.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—Elias must earn the Countess’s truth to complete his living obituary—tightens once when the carpet anecdote is offered. Agency is shared: her disclosure and his receptive silence foreclose further isolation. Cost is felt in the rain’s interruption and the blank page awaiting words. No external reversals are needed; the deepening of mutual recognition suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each failed prototype until the single crystallizing note forecloses the dream of organic return. Escalation is causal: every attempt strips away another illusion until only echo remains. Cost is legible in the tears and the word “completely and utterly.” No external antagonist needed; the sterile world supplies sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“to prove that scars can sing”—is tested through each graft; the final hum is the earned tightening that forecloses the path of mere remembrance. Pressure escalates via accumulative density of materials and memory rather than causal reversals. Cost is felt in the audible fracture/healing resonance. No external antagonist needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberate the city’s trapped memories—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each breadcrumb and nightly vigil. The seventh-night alignment forces the decisive, irreversible “unstick,” with the cost of seven days’ endurance etched in Elara’s silence. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens; no reversal, but deepening pattern reweights the silence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the Garden’s quiet beauty—faces a single tightening when the probe’s violent scan threatens calcification. Escalation is coherent under the Accumulative lens; the price (loss of pure non-interference) is legible but understated.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—discovering the shape of collective grief—tightens through escalating sensory density rather than external reversals. The butterfly river deepens the cost of static carving; final stance forecloses monument-as-endpoint. Agency remains Eliran’s throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance—signaled in paragraph one and escalates as each micro-error compounds into social fracture. Tightening occurs when Silas realizes the rake handle’s confessions demand cumulative penance; each adjustment forecloses the option of heroic shortcuts. Cost is the physical and spiritual exhaustion etched in “trembling, precise tools.”

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“shape of intentions”—begins quiet, intensifies through tactile deciphering of object-history, narrows to single irrevocable choice: keep or return king-laden locket. Progression is incremental, not escalatory; the cost is conceptually felt but slightly abstract, keeping it shy of 8.0+ clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    Primary stake—energy fate—tightens from managed decline to inevitable invention under predictive modelling; a visible 0.0001-to-100% price is paid to forge the new path. One escalation loop suffices; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore story to a silenced world—tightens through each cloaking session; the cost is time, secrecy, and the irrevocable shift in identity. One clear deepening: the dust’s first whispered tale proves the tactic viable, foreclosing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—crystallize a fleeting emotion—tightens as each smudge risks erasing the memory it tries to fix. The mask’s false wholeness and the urn’s dwindling weight apply coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: preserve vs. correct history. Pressure tightens when the cog contradicts the sanctioned narrative; the dive is the single, irreversible escalation. Cost is the loss of Elias’s protective exile. Agency is high: every move is his decision under mounting evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—program’s cancellation—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: each subtraction of voices intensifies the cost of loss. Leo’s softened tone is the decisive tightening that proves harmony possible just as the path closes. Agency remains with Eliza’s method.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore feeling to a numb city—tightens when the fruit must be ready for the eclipse. One decisive intensification: plucking the luminous orb under eerie twilight. Cost is the risk of failure and the irreversible consumption of the single fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—city’s food versus light—is signaled early and tightened by the irreversible battery choice. Escalation is causal: each diagnostic beat narrows options until only one path remains. Cost is legible in the tower’s enduring darkness. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—why houses feel alive—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes the house gathers, not generates.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free the creator vs. preserve the lie—is signaled early and tightens through each micro-action. Escalation is driven by Veridian’s agency under the Accumulative lens; the cost of dissolution is visible on the page. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—escape via flaw-exploitation—is signaled early. Escalation is one sustained tightening: each failed proof narrows options until the die’s bias becomes the last lever. The final thrust reweights the stake from “break the loop” to “hijack the loop,” with the cost of possible annihilation legible in the abyss she skirts. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the lens, save memory—is signaled in paragraph three. Escalation tightens once: thaw or lose heritage. Agency is hers; luck complicates (ice) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Tension escalates as each click of reversed gears constricts options, culminating in the lethal rewind of tide and oxygen—stakes pivot on Eliran’s specific, irreversible choice to start the mechanism.

    Dominant stake—evade tonight’s death—tightens once: each paradoxical confession visibly weakens the shadow-form, foreclosing the option of flight. Agency is Elias’s pen strokes; cost is the photograph’s erasure. Pressure escalates under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—turn destructive chaos into playable harmony—tightens through escalating wind and spray until Kaelen’s final stance crystallizes. The price is the bodily depletion that makes the earned stasis credible.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—city survival via course change—signaled early and tightened by fracture. Agency is Elara’s descent and whistle; cost is collective terror and irreversible heading. Escalation causal, one meaningful tightening sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.7)
    The “rescue truth” stake intensifies when Aris moves from solo archival proof to armed fellowship, sharpening the danger that state power will silence them. Escalation is steady but still moderate; the political threat looms larger than is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—a belief in the salvability of loss—tightens once: solitary archive threatened by witness becomes consensual stewardship with Elara. No further escalation needed; the cost (loss of curator solitude) is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—prove the lie—escalates from ledger suspicion to physical charter confirmation; each narrowing choice (dead shelf → stamp vault) raises cost.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into living memorial—signaled early. Escalation: silence → soul-cost → fragility risk → luminous peace. One decisive tightening: choosing to pay soul-fragment. Cost legible on page (“take a piece of your soul”). Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate from survivor’s emotional void to re-engineering an orbital eye; pressure coheres under lens of perturbation. One tightening choice (occupy dormant mirror) raises physical and existential cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled early and tightened once when the telescope pivots downward, foreclosing the aerial/drone path. Cost is conceptual (loss of prior certainty) rather than visceral, but legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to test the weight of her own deceit—is signaled early and tightens through each driftwood fragment until the terrace confrontation forces a public cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—salvaging Kael and the lesson—is signaled in paragraph two. Pressure tightens once: the moonlit bridge narrows options to seventy-two breaths. Cost is felt when both abandon the token; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Elias still move with purpose?—is signaled early and tightened when he swaps celestial ambition for pole-to-pole progress. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the relinquishment of grand bearings. Agency drives every beat; no coincidence resolves.

    Dominant stake—kindling empathy—tightens when the geologist’s fear confronts her void. One meaningful deepening: the impossible baseball forces a third path between erased past and empty future.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reforge bond beyond death—signaled early. Escalation: spices ignite memory, rift opens, past is altered, timeline re-knits. Cost is legible: Alaric is “remade,” implying irreversible self-change.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can the Steward unlock a dimension to redeem extinction—is signaled early. Escalation is accumulative: each grief-memory increases mass, narrowing physical and emotional options until the tear offers a single, costly path.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—understanding transformation—is signaled early and tightens when the old woman reframes Elara’s bankruptcy as necessary payment. One clear escalation: the swarm’s arrow-shot to the crater forecloses any return to prior philanthropy and carries visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stake (scientific detachment vs accepting fragility) tightens through dust accumulation, narrowing options from quantification to archiving renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake (answering distress signal) tightens meaningfully via protagonist agency; cost is undeniable in grandfather's dissolution, though escalation could heighten urgency earlier under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Kael's agency (hiding to observe) narrows options to truth vs sustaining hope. Cost crystallizes in "he would give them a different story" – conceptual price of truth for communal resilience. Single tightening suffices at this length, though sanctions' mechanical pressure could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven purely by Elara’s agency: tracing the image shifts to temple vision, breathing reveals mantra, stone search follows. Cost is unmistakable—"emotional flood" of compassion to be channeled, not kept. Single tightening (vision-to-reality shift) suffices for length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate via protagonist agency (re-calculating space through geometry), but the single tightening lacks felt cost until closure; the photos’ fade as "calibrations" deepens knowledge without narrowing options earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when sentry appears, forcing the vault-sealing choice, but external conflict resolution feels coincidental (kick misdirects shot); dominant "protect seeds" stake lacks internal tension with "chained liberator" identity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes tighten when Elara must experience betrayal *as* the betrayed, narrowing options to endure or flee. Cost is unmistakable in her transformation: the "faithful blue shattering" redefines trust’s physics, altering her design philosophy implicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (stealing the moment before sunset) tightens via constable’s arrival, forcing the window leap. Cost is visceral: heart-in-throat drop and "jarring thud" on the gantry. Agency remains hers; luck (gantry proximity) complicates but doesn’t resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.3)
    Thawing ice escalates pressure under Accumulative lens through sensory density, but the cost of abandonment remains conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in the pivotal beat; "weighty lightness" phrase carries conceptual cost without physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation under Causal lens is masterful: phobia transforms from weakness to tool, with gut-churning dread→sob-breath→weeping ascent showing unmistakable cost. One tightening suffices for length, driven purely by Leo's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake (mapping endless night) tightens via deepening silence, but pressure relies solely on atmospheric shift; protagonist agency in interpreting the flake earns cost, yet escalation lacks one additional intensification beat for higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)

Cost is legible in "willingly allowing its own fractured existence to amalgamate," though physical stakes could heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Anya’s agency: "discrepancy" → "cryptic doodles" → "weapon" escalates moral vise. Cost is unmistakable in the incineration’s physicality ("breath that felt like her first"). Fits Accumulative lens perfectly—no causal shortcuts, pressure grows via discovery density.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: Cederic's meter declaration forces Elara's revelation choice. Cost is visceral in her clenched heart and later exhalation, foreclosing secrecy while saving the garden's purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (proving sideways time) tighten via the avian's acknowledgment, creating undeniable conceptual cost. Escalation relies on Vesh's agency ("Wait") rather than Aris's, limiting pressure depth. The single deepening meets scope requirements but lacks visible price charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara's realization ("not meant to be played, but felt") escalates to vibration disrupting foundations. Cost is unmistakable—"plaster dust sifted" reweights decay as release under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake (uncovering truth) tightens through Elara's agency interpreting radio static. Cost is visceral in exhaustion and "metallic taste," though the radio's origin feels slightly coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (silence as regenerative force) tighten texturally through hum's progression, but the "crumbling peace" concept isn't viscerally tested until climax. Cost (exhaustion, fragility) legible, though dominant pressure could escalate sooner under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (wonder vs. grief) tightens via eclipse cadence shift, narrowing Leo’s options to engagement or retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (Lena’s trapped life) tighten when the lighthouse signal appears, forcing her to choose; the cost—leaving her known misery—is felt in “uncertain, beautiful key,” but the transition lacks visceral friction under Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate purely through Ansel’s rhetorical agency: layered loops narrow the entity’s options until its foundational flaw shatters. Cost is visceral in the expended pigment and Carver’s gasping collapse. “Unraveled stillness” directly changes tactics—Ansel weaponizes the entity’s terror of questions.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Exhaustion countdown tightens tactics ("had to act before exhaustion hits"), forcing final gesture; cost visible in buckled knees, but "dawn" resolution edges toward coincidence without deeper causal link to memory mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (defeating numbness) signaled immediately. Escalation via vibration quality: Leo’s screeching → gliding bow → recital’s "tactile harmony."

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (understanding memory’s impact) tightens via Elara’s vial—a single escalation that reweights options. Silas’s agency in inhaling it narrows his path from confusion to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stake crystallization: "chronic hush is not empty" deepens knowledge under Accumulative lens. Single-note action narrows options to unbinding echoes, with cost legible in "heartbreaking chorus." Agency drives escalation—her choice to play reconfigures silence into conversation with undeniable emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation falters when Warden's exposition ("harmony breaking") tells rather than shows rising stakes; dominant "echo survival" stake tightens via cadence flaw detection but lacks one tangible pressure beat before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (quantifying ambiguous loss) tightens through protagonist's agency—using glass eyes transforms knowledge, narrowing options from "unsolved" formulae to "map of resilience"; cost legible in her relinquished secrecy ("nothing left to hide") under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: her lantern swing (not force) exploits shadow physics, reweighting the "bright darkness" into portals. Cost is legible in her earned humility ("magnify not just magic, but understanding") after blindness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's speech triggering realization, but "deliberate interruption" accusation emerges without visible protagonist agency in the Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate via deepening (cracks→doors→library) under Accumulative lens. Cost is felt in "trembled with certainty," but dominant stake ("fortress") lacks concrete dramatization beyond abstract yearning. Agency strong, yet emotional price remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Elias’s agency: nightly tile use deepens emotional stakes until broadcast forces crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency (timing move with storm, using fragment) with visible cost (crumbling shard), but internal conflict (curiosity vs safety) lacks dramatized hesitation; solar storm's "live clock" tightens decisions without countdown specificity.

    Dominant stake (reconciling deception with sacrifice) tightens through internal deepening, not external pressure. Passport discovery narrows options by liquefying her worldview, with cost legible in "mathematics... tragically incomplete." Agency-driven under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserving time textures before dawn) tightens via the hum's natural calming, but Aris lacks agency in escalation—pressure is environmental, not choice-driven. Cost ("body stiff") is visible, yet her passive endurance feels inevitable rather than earned through conflicting tactics under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation through density increase (hum → images → understanding) reweights the stake, but protagonist agency fades during reception—the Signal unfolds passively rather than through her choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (preserve consciousness vs. survive) tightens meaningfully via oxygen alarm, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the leviathan's appearance feels coincidental rather than arising from Elias's actions. Cost is legible but pressure isn't driven by his choices until climax.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominate stake ("before they find the bodies") tightens decisions under Accumulative lens: Warden's advance forces truth-speaking with visible cost (bodies remain hidden).

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens shines as the ghost's ephemeral appearances deepen emotional stakes, culminating in the devastating realization that the debt is for a "life unlived"; the cost—ghost's dissolution—is felt through the orchard's rebirth and Elara's tear, narrowing options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via linguistic deepening ("tangled syntax" to "complex weave") driven by agency (tilting inkwell), with unmistakable conceptual cost in broken silence. Timeframe urgency lacks active clock pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via accumulating thread-untangling narrows options under Accumulative lens: each liberated echo ("chill of a poet," "heat of a warrior") deepens the lullaby's dissolution with visible cost in "shuddered through her own body." Dominant stake (defying conformity) signaled immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single tightening forecloses Elara’s old path: reversing Kael’s story by "inverting her role" to become "vessel, not author" narrows options with visible cost (destroying pristine calligraphy).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)

    Dominant stake (freeing creativity) tightens through aurora progression, but escalation lacks visible cost beyond abstract melancholy; agency passive in pivotal star-tracing sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via sensory intensification ("wriging like snake" to "shattered melody") drives agency; conceptual cost ("calm and enduring spark") reweights the dominant stake, though physical sacrifice would elevate tension.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through sensory distortion: hum sharpens "into a plea," discordant grinding escalates to dying rasp. Agency drives resolution (harmonizing, not assembling), with visible cost in relinquishing the gear; one meaningful deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: Elara's whispered story (meaningful trade-off) narrows options by exchanging vulnerability for passage. Cost is visible in the "heart sank" moment, though pressure intensification lacks one more tightening beat pre-crossing.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation through Accumulative lens: handprint discovery deepens "safety vs truth" stake; cost legible in throat sensation and "sterile safety" realization, though silence policy's origin lacks on-page complication.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation succeeds via Accumulative density increase (scholarly focus → confrontation), with cost unmistakable in the pretender's unraveling. Strength: dominant stake signaled early; one meaningful deepening (rune activation) forecloses his path.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: coordinates trigger hydrological research, reframing "calibrated hope" into tangible pilgrimage. Cost is visceral in "smaller than old stories"—the reef's diminished state forecloses naive optimism. Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds via density (atlas, data, dive) reweighting the dominant stake: survival isn't binary but a "continuum" with visible fragility.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via the shrinking daylight and intensifying stone hum, but the cost of reigniting remains abstract; "heart hammered" lacks the visible trade-off (e.g., injury, sacrifice) required to elevate beyond 8.5 under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through the decoding process, but Elara’s passive reception of "implanted destiny" lacks active conflict escalation; the cost (relinquishing control) is felt but not wrestled with in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via storm-triggered freeze drives agency toward somatic reclamation; cost is legible in the stone anchoring the photo, foreclosing escape into trauma under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara’s realization that she must "navigate" chaos (not fight it) forces the thread-selection trade-off. Cost is unmistakable when she discards the sorrowful portrait thread during descent.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through ink experimentation, but the eclipse's "crisis" remains off-page; drone disappearance provides conceptual cost yet lacks visceral personal stakes narrowing Silas's options meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven purely by Elara’s agency: her decision to use dormant networks narrows options from "file or reveal" to irreversible action. Conceptual cost ("monument of lies" detonated) is unmistakable in "no going back," reconfiguring the dominant stake through causal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency through sensory density ("engraved quiet" to discovery tremor), with cost legible in shattered peace ("fragile, lie built on secret"); single tightening crystallizes stance under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate coherently from personal revolt to city-wide collapse via Viola's logic, but economic destabilization remains slightly abstract versus visceral felt cost in the "black hole of scandal" image.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten when the glitch invades as her own broken-promise voice, escalating pressure via sonic invasion rather than external force. Agency shines in her binding method—using amber-translated cries to weave with guilt—foreclosing erasure for integration. Cost is visceral: permanent transformation of dissonance into "hushed harmony."

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes deepen via Accumulative pressure: emergent hush tightens into sonic tapestry, forcing Elara's stance crystallization. Cost legible in lifted unease, but emotional weight slightly abstract. Philosopher's interruption tests commitment without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (renaming history) tightens via protagonist agency: inserting the tessera into the gauntlet forces a trade-off (exposing truth vs. official records). Cost is legible in "painful, beautiful admission," though escalation lacks one visible tactical shift beyond the broadcast.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: layering echoes narrows options to weaving joy/sorrow. Cost is legible in vanished pain and timeline snapping, though transformation feels slightly effortless at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: pill ingestion → somatic focus → geode reach. Pressure coheres via Accumulative lens; cost ("hollow hum" → immersive flood) is unmistakable. Minor deduction: static shock as inciting incident slightly convenient but functional.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes ("translate unspoken truths") deepen through emotional escalation under Accumulative lens, but pressure lacks visceral cost—Kaelen’s awe-driven float alters no tactics, and the abstract "weight of stone dissolving" fails to demonstrate a concrete forfeiture or trade-off during the pivotal connection.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when echo's meaning unravels, narrowing options to button cataloging. Agency-driven deepening shifts knowledge ("prophecy not fixed point") with visible conceptual cost in the hourglass transformation, satisfying Band 8.8+ guardrail.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten purely through situational pressure: compromised channels → snow codes → need for credible source. Cost ("concrete cell") is unmistakable and shapes Elias’s irreversible vouchsafe choice under coherent environmental constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (keeping palimpsest promise) tightens via the gutter-drip countdown; agency manifests in endurance, not decision, with cost in the vigil's conclusion—elevated by the Accumulative lens' pressure accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency: initial curiosity ("to understand resistance") tightens to the beekeeper’s final offering, with cost crystallized in her transformation from uncoverer to legacy-bearer—no coincidence, pure accumulated pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes crystallize early: will her "small defiance against the gray" pierce the building’s gloom? Escalation via protagonist agency—angling the mirror to illuminate specific photos/walls narrows options to intimate connection. Cost is legible in the rose’s demise preceding renewal, tightening the emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (coexisting with grief) escalates through Accumulative lens: each sensory detail ("sigh of wind," "fractured reflection") deepens isolation until the hum’s resonance forces stance crystallization. Cost is legible in softened edges—a felt price paid for independence without erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stake (disconnection from purpose) tightens through protagonist agency: transforming unsent letters into public art narrows options from private hoarding to communal offering. Visible cost in "hollow" letter preceding action; "mend" shows irrevocable change. Single deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten causally: signal strength → community division → discovery of subsonic manipulation. Agency-driven escalation peaks with broadcast decision; cost manifests as exhaustion and "infinite game" awareness. Single tightening suffices for scope.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single stake (surviving spatial mutiny to find key) tightens via organ note’s textural escalation; protagonist agency drives climax (compass plunge forecloses escape). Cost unmistakable in "trembling breath" against "crushing reality," though mutiny’s origin lacks deeper causal layer.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes tighten irrevocably at "his motivation shifted, irrevocably" when empathy overrides method. Agency is pure protagonist choice: placing ribbon beside palette enables synthesis. Cost is unmistakable—"he could still not remember a face, but now he knew he could finally see one"—reconfiguring lifelong limitation under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten accumulatively: decoding stanzas narrows options to ritual nail-pull, with conceptual cost made undeniable as "mandate" replaces naive idealism. Escalation driven purely by Elara’s agency (methodical search → questioning entries), though jet stream shift lacks temporal urgency beyond thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by Elias' agency: recounting details leads to scaffold realization, narrowing options to the logging path. Cost ("never burned away") legible but slightly abstract; "ash on the wind" makes it visceral. Dominant stake (overcoming "never") signaled early and tightened meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Ash’s agency-driven questions ("Why didn’t he?"), narrowing options as the old man’s exposition reveals the father’s failed escape. The cost—recognizing "polished calm" as a prison—is unmistakable in Ash’s final rejection, fulfilling escalation under the Accumulative lens with no reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes viscerally tighten as telescope verification narrows options from static translation to temporal star-pulse tracking; cost crystallizes when glyphs reveal "dimming" requiring communal vigil, not individual triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: failed ritual → seed’s bargain → crystallized refusal. Cost is unmistakable in physical pain transforming to numbness, reconfiguring "containment" as active endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.4)
    Single tightening (early eclipse) narrows options under Accumulative lens; cost is legible in the incision that "completed the pattern".

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's analogical realization narrowing options from forced decoding to surrender. Dominant stake (understanding transition physics) tightened via felt cost: releasing seed risks his last link to Elara, altering tactics irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes ("hold contradictions without breaking") deepen via Elian’s pivotal acceptance, but escalation relies on moon phase (external) not agency. Single tightening suffices for length, yet visible cost (tears) doesn’t alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes accumulate texturally through sensory weight ("crushing grip of fear"), but the dominant conflict lacks concrete obstacles—Elara faces no tangible resistance delivering the pearl, muting the cost of her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens meaningfully when map reveals "eddies of regret," forcing Elara to trade cartography for embodied action. Cost is visceral in "path would be long," but medication timeframe lacks pressure escalation beyond initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation driven by documentation deepening under Accumulative lens, with cost legible in transformed silence. Father's letter revelation slightly convenient, but cyclic cipher groundwork earns the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    Single dominant stake (truth vs empire's facade) tightens through Elara's agency-driven escalation (helping fracture propagate). Cost unmistakable in final image: symbolic power shattered without violence, reconfiguring imperial authority.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate via deepening ritual: capturing the spark requires crossing the threshold, narrowing options to pure essence. Cost is legible in bodily stillness ("breathing halting, heart pausing"), with agency driving the deepening under Accumulative lens; no coincidences resolve pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is pure protagonist agency: Elara’s ritual adjustment ("moved her hand with the memory of every keeper") directly resolves the murkiness, with the cost of ancestral self-forgiveness reweighting the rebirth stake decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (selling truth vs. finding nuance) tightens through chime melody shifts; client's faltering and Elara's unhooking force irreversible trade-off with palpable cost in his retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (finding silence) deepen through atmospheric pressure but lack protagonist-driven tightening; Kaelen’s epiphany feels gifted rather than earned through his choices. No visible cost paid for the transformation weakens escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Zephyr's agency: birds' flight deepens understanding, arrowhead repurposed from striking to levering, but the physical/emotional cost of her choice ("breathing deeply") feels undercharged in the final image per band requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten causally: the keystone’s glow (early signal) escalates to life-threatening ice shift, forcing Elara’s creative intervention. Cost is visceral ("breathless and shaking") and shapes the final image—her "soft light of understanding" directly opposes the automated world’s "blinding, automated sun," reweighting options under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten through Silas's agency (repeated dives), but escalation lacks visceral resistance; the vow resolves the conflict almost magically without prior struggle against his hiding instinct.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: prophecy vision (pressure deepening) forces rejection of stagnant peace for struggle; conceptual cost of embracing chaotic growth is unmistakable in the final breath.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: hum → swirling echoes → crystallization. Protagonist agency drives every intensification; cost legible in "echo of sacrifice" becoming "monument." No coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (preserve meaning vs. erase pain) tightens through photo trail discoveries. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the uncorking choice, with visible cost in the liqueur’s embodied taste and exposed vulnerability to bulldozer crews.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the raptor threatens the crystal, but escalation lacks visceral cost—her panic ("cold and sharp") isn't deepened by a tangible loss (e.g., near-shattering) before the solution emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten causally: automated pod rejection forces manual override, narrowing options. Cost is unmistakable—abandoning the arbor, risking death—but the single reversal lacks a secondary trade-off (e.g., time vs. safety) for 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.4)
    Accumulative escalation through protagonist-driven emotional pairings (joy/sorrow, trust/betrayal) meaningfully tightens pressure each attempt. Dominant stake (defeating numbness) reweights with visceral cost: "agonizing, beautiful friction of feeling everything." No coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is flawlessly causal: seed → coordinates → corporate threat → planting as weaponized action. The cost is unmistakable in Elara’s "racing heart" and the permanent silence—agency drives every narrowing of options without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes ("restore lost laughter") tighten through protagonist agency: vocal exhaustion and fuel depletion narrow options. Escalation via sound layering ("sonic tapestry of shared pain") reweights grief under Accumulative lens. Cost ("voice gone") visibly alters tactics, charging final image of walking toward light.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes crystallize immediately: guard rift vs. sate homesickness. Escalation via pendant's "warning heartbeat" forces agency—Elara's choice to mend using the garden's "interior truth" narrows options with cost (enduring longing). Pressure tightens under Accumulative lens through perceptual deepening, not external action.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes viscerally escalate through Alder's iterative agency under Accumulative lens; the cost of hopelessness shattered is felt in "no longer hopeless" and the Nexus's shudder, though no secondary physical toll narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: discarding assumptions drives the micro-adjustments. Visible cost—years of failure resolved by paradigm shift—charges the final image as dust coalesces into "reverse explosion" under silent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (unwritten commuters) escalate through Felix's agency—radio call as a meaningful tightening—but the "sudden instinctual clarity" about timelines lacks friction; cost crystallizes in "haunting knowledge," yet the peak choice feels slightly compressed without a visible trade-off in the grotto.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens: emotional density builds through woven memories until Arthur’s recognition forces irreversible catharsis. Cost is unmistakable (thread dissolution, overwhelming sensation), though pressure could feel more inevitable under extreme length constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes ("expand understanding vs huddle in dark") escalate cleanly through her navigation attempts, but The Visitor’s benevolent response removes tension without trade-off; conceptual cost isn’t viscerally felt despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation hinges on the pulses fading ("energy nearly spent"), narrowing Elara's options to one decisive action; the conceptual cost (unreceived love, expended maternal energy) is legible but slightly abstracted until the final image reweights it, falling just short of unmistakable immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (uncovering truth vs. survival) tighten meaningfully via tidal clock and claustrophobic tunnel crawl, where visible cost (trembling hands, vision swimming) forecloses retreat. Agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens, though tidal pressure could resonate earlier beyond "time was enemy" setup.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stake deepening (textures → ghost voices) driven by agency; "canyon began reflecting memories" escalates pressure under Accumulative lens with visceral cost in weeping endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (Aris's mission vs. empathetic awakening) tightens through the confessions' deepening revelations, culminating in her arrowhead throw. Cost is legible in the Changed's transformed anguish, but escalation lacks sufficient protagonist agency before the climax beat under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes crystallize immediately—reawakening beauty versus mechanical sterility—with pressure tightening via statues' interception forcing Kael's final dissonant cry. Agency is pure protagonist choice (shell thrust), and cost is unmistakable: the clockwork heart's violent expulsion reshapes the city's very pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drone escalation narrows delivery window meaningfully, forcing Kael’s urgency with visible cost in posture and timing. However, the standoff resolution feels slightly convenient—drone retreat lacks sufficient consequence beyond tension, weakening the cost legibility under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (can joy be restored?) is signaled early, and the deepening—"it needed to sing"—narrows options. However, escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; Elara's realization feels passive ("this was not a thing to be repaired"), and the cost ("her silence") remains abstract without visceral, on-page forfeiture during the singing climax.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (finding story-origin) tightens through sensory deepening, but patron presence fails to apply secondary pressure. Cost ("reawakened her own story") feels earned though not viscerally paid on-page during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency—discovering then wielding the palette—foreclosing passive longing with the palpable cost of transformed tides; the single escalation suffices for length, though the positive outcome softens cost legibility versus traditional sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Lysander’s disorienting story (9E), narrowing options by shattering the woman’s fixed perception; cost is felt in the tear’s erosion of inherited truth, though cosmic phrasing slightly dilutes immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when fading light forces constellation reinterpretation; agency drives escalation (Elias follows glass angles). Cost is legible in the reframed memory’s emotional weight, though secondary pressure (environment) outweighs internal conflict depth.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate texturally: fading colors push back as "weary nihilism" during essence gathering. Agency clear in pouring hope when weakening. Cost (physical drain, temporary victory) is visible and shapes the Earned Stasis closure. One tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elara’s agency: silence accumulation tightens pressure until the final knot’s release, with visceral cost legible in the lifted chest weight and mask’s shift from "rictus of fear" to "weary acceptance."

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (interpreting silence) tightens via shadow discrepancy, narrowing options to empathy over force. Cost is visceral: centuries' weight reconfigured as "blanket," not burden. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves; whisper earns stairway reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single deepening (theory → physical proof) suffices for length; protagonist's agency in touching snow globe creates irreversible cost (shattered object), reweighting "letting go" from intellectual to visceral under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency (decoding glyphs against storm clock) with felt cost, but bolt plate solution lacks meaningful friction; tightening is sufficient yet misses the trade-off depth needed for 9.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: deciphering joy becomes a live choice with cost (commander receives objects, not meaning). Pressure accumulates via lens/light mechanics, narrowing options to revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake (proving sky holds memory) deepens via ascent. Agency in continuing observations under threat creates visible cost (physical danger), but "quietly explosive" label lacks tactical impact to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens: fractal pattern density intensifies from wall to coin to safe lock, narrowing options to the hand-press solution. Cost is unmistakable in the building’s "groan" and Elara’s foreclosed preservation path. Single tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake ("chart next great discovery") tightens through cipher-decoding, narrowing options to the void. Agency entirely Elara’s—no coincidence—culminating in felt cost of isolation crystallized during revelation. Single deepening suffices; stakes viscerally felt via racing thoughts syncing with starlings.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through tactile failure: mismatched gears multiply in mirrors while cold-numbed fingers struggle with the vial. Escalation peaks when "uncap" redefines the solution, but the cost ("air warming just a degree") feels slightly underweighted for the global fracture premise.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation via accumulative density: each failed message narrows options, deepening despair until the map forces reexamination. Cost is visceral in fraying faith and brambled hope. Agency lies in settlers’ collective obedience then understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes (maintain clock vs. permit rest) tighten through Elara's agency when she reads the puppet's fracture lines. Escalation via deepening knowledge ("shared token") narrows options, with cost legible in the stars' emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes viscerally tighten around the frost deadline, driving Kaelen’s agency from patrol to blueprint activation. The cost—imminent entrapment—is unmistakable in the final line, though escalation relies slightly on the traveler’s accidental stone dislodgement.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (atone for toxin) tightens through Aris's agency observing foam, narrowing options from rigid cage to fluid process. Cost ("grief loosened") is felt not visible, just missing the 8.8+ visible-price threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Elara’s agency—quantifying absence narrows options to surgical incision—reweights dominant stake (story origins) with felt cost (spent moonlight, man’s transformation). Pressure deepens via procedural precision, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (containing remorse's corrosive power) tightens through Kaelen's agency during subsumption; visible cost in physical collapse forecloses escape. Escalation via emotional density shift ("not a taste anymore; direct transfusion") meets Accumulative lens rigor. One tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (mending silo fractures) tightens meaningfully when the cuckoo’s song forces immediate silo responses. Pressure escalates through Elara’s agency—her vocal harmony directly triggers Grain/Ore/Lore dialogue. Cost is conceptual but visceral: the Ore Silo’s "rumble" and Grain’s "creak" prove isolation’s end. Single deepening suffices; the weight’s realignment forecloses failure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (integration vs. madness) tightens through intensifying visions from joy to murdered dream, with visceral cost in tears and shaking. Pressure grows via protagonist’s agency initiating the test, though vision reception feels slightly passive during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (finding seeds to combat "sleep for all minds") tightens when activation reveals bearer requirement, forcing her pivotal choice. Cost is unmistakable: "responsibility" and eternal vigilance. Agency drives all escalation; inversion catalyst narrows options without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via crack analysis forecloses rigid approach with emotional cost. Wind's role as complicating coincidence slightly muddies agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through the Nexus’s phase shift deadline, narrowing Kael’s options to humming before pathways lock. His agency drives the deepening: correlating silence with the brother’s tapping reweights the dominant stake (healing vs. exile) with visible cost—the stone’s dent becoming a physical testament to his "silent war" victory.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure as sonic tuning intensifies, narrowing options to one resonant frequency. Fireworks' eruption forces the CR moment, but their coincidence slightly weakens protagonist-driven escalation under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens succeeds as Elara's impatience compounds ("resent the plant’s slow pace"), culminating in the sleeve-brush triggering the scent; cost is unmistakable in her surrender to the smell's inevitability.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.0)
    Gravity inversion creates stakes, but escalation relies on coincidence (arrow tip discovery); protagonist's passive observation undermines agency-driven tightening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (prevent convergence) tightens through Vale’s agency: wind documentation → patch realization → transmission of countermeasures. Cost felt in physical toll ("voice a rasp") and unstable event. Escalation driven by causal expertise, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist-driven sensory deepening (muted bells → auroral pillar), but external catalyst ("sculptor’s chisel crack") weakens agency under Accumulative lens. Cost ("drained but complete") is felt yet insufficiently specific; dominant stake reweighted effectively by final image despite minor reliance on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara steps into the monochrome realm, making "ghosts of choices" visceral; cost is unmistakable in "painful clarity," though the single escalation beat lacks deeper knowledge transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: pressing the fragment inward transforms abstract loneliness into visceral, destabilizing feedback. Cost is unmistakable in "profound emptiness at her own core," but escalation lacks one tangible loss (e.g., fragment damage) to tighten tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (routine vs. wonder) tightens via pendant’s activation forcing Silas’s stance crystallization. Cost—loss of old life—is legible in “his work had just begun,” though escalation lacks a micro-choice during the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation under accumulative lens: prism's geometry failure deepens stakes into despair, then frost's "feathery fractals" narrow options to a single resonant reconfiguration. Conceptual cost is unmistakable in "shattered assumption" line, though physical cost remains implicit.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (stopping raveling silence) signaled early; pressure tightens as silence actively unravels tapestry nightly. Agency shown via Elara's puzzle assembly and loom destruction. Cost is visceral (life's work destroyed) and conceptual (message delivered through time, not space). Puzzle solution edges toward coincidence but framed as earned method.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the dominant stake (understanding Aris’ sacrifice) tightens through sensory accumulation until the vision shatters. Elara’s agency—her focus and redirection attempts—drives the deepening, with cost legible in "crushing" weight and the bay’s repurposing. One meaningful tightening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (protect letters as safety) tightens via ghost targeting their "warmth." Elias’s cairn action narrows options through agency—stone language as weapon. Cost legible in physical effort, but ghost’s letter-focused motive lacks prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when jest becomes prophecy; agency drives escalation through lens adjustment. Cost is unmistakable in Silas' realization he "had touched the machinery of the world."

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.4)
    Single dominant stake (narrative magnetism) tightens through Hira's sun-trail method—agency-driven deepening forecloses "why" quest. Cost crystallizes in heart's shift from "foreign thing" to perception instrument, legible at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes (rekindling realm) are clear but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure; the memory shock is coincidental, not earned through Elara’s agency. Community singing deepens stakes yet omits visible trade-offs like vocal strain or fading hope.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten via protagonist agency: hiding invitation → physical journey → re-reading error. Cost is undeniable in "leaving error neatly on shelf"—shame released but identity transformed. Midnight deadline vitalizes pressure without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation hinges on Elara's agency: her bringing the bread triggers Kael's uncloaking, transforming abstract stakes into visceral warmth ("smelling of yeast and honey"). The cost—"tenuous absolution" requiring "continued belief"—is unmistakable in the final bite, reweighting the dominant stake through protagonist-driven deepening under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (preserving meaning against oblivion) tightens through Elara’s agency: each frequency sample narrows options by deepening knowledge, culminating in the vow vision. Escalation under accumulative lens reweights the library’s essence from "cold tomb" to "living heart," with conceptual cost made visceral in "oblivion pushed back." No coincidence—revelation stems solely from her meticulous choices.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten causally through false starts (search dead ends → knot tightening) and texturally via the dissolving market. Elara’s agency drives the climax—her questioning forces Silas’s gesture, making the sigh’s cost undeniable. Sunrise deadline isn’t just backdrop; it pressures the recorder’s "one charge" constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation through sensory density ("taste exploded... all layered") under the Accumulative lens narrows Kael's options, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost: his "lifelong search for singular truth" shatters when he understands their pluralistic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (suppressed creativity) signaled early, but escalation depends on external inciting incident (old woman) rather than protagonist-driven pressure. Key cost (wasted years) is felt but not earned through active struggle until final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by agency: plumber's admission narrows options (truth as path forward), with visceral cost (leaden limbs → restored strength) legible in "washed over her like cool water".

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (preserving wonder) are viscerally felt through the ice's decay, but the cost remains conceptual ("inevitable decay") rather than embodied in Elara's sacrifice. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative lens, yet one deeper intensification beat would elevate the pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (healing through listening) tightens via neighborhood fragments → hospital confrontation. Agency-driven escalation: Elara’s method forecloses interrogation path. Cost legible in Leo’s "spent and trembling" state. Accident coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve; minor knowledge leap (envelope connection) prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency: her dance-encryption of vulnerability (beat 1) directly unlocks the AI (beat 2), narrowing options from solitude to liberation. Cost is legible in the dice’s shattering—a physical manifestation of foreclosed isolation. Single tightening suffices for length, though secondary stakes (meaninglessness) could deepen earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (recovering excised memories) tighten through gravity-pocket escalations, but lack deeper transformation. Agency in exhume action narrows options credibly, though the cost (physical strain) feels underdeveloped versus the thematic weight of memory return.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation via density increase—knot unraveling strand by strand—driven solely by protagonist agency; cost crystallizes in "poured every ounce of cultivated tranquility," unmistakable in the supernova metaphor before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (deciphering building’s language) tightens through Valerius’s incremental revelations, culminating in meteor-shower confrontation where Elara’s agency ("truly interrogate him") forces crystallization. Cost legible in Valerius’s fading form, though secondary pressure (her own apartment’s whispers) underutilized. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency—Elara's choice to place the shell triggers the memory flood. Cost is unmistakable: "isolation was not independence—it was a life half-lived." Dawn timing forces crystallization; coincidence (shell discovery) complicates but doesn't resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by Kaelin’s agency: her confession (“The orders sent my brother’s regiment to die”) forces Varos’ revelation of the Queen’s plan. Dominant stake (correcting fatal orders) tightens when Varos identifies the forgery flaw, redefining options with visceral cost—Kaelin’s shattered assumption of solitary treason. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through knowledge deepening (shell → text → nexus), with her method driving escalation under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable in "melancholy lifted, replaced by solemn duty," though trader's role could heighten external pressure earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by protagonist’s dream-fragment assembly forecloses accidental explosion theory, but insurance fraud motive feels slightly undercooked for maximum causal inevitability under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (preserving firefly patterns) tighten through Ren’s agency (net-mending), yet pressure lacks escalation; the cost (disoriented fireflies) is legible but doesn’t transform tactics beyond the single rescue beat.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through storm escalation forcing Elara's stance crystallization. Dominant "truth vs comfort" conflict resolves via renunciation with felt cost: her life's work dies as she chooses orchard's survival over exposure, altering tactics permanently.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen via Orin’s agency: music box transforms passive collection into active resurrection, narrowing options to "sweetening" fading memories. Cost is unmistakable in Miss Elara’s "crackly but true" voice and weeks of searching.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes signaled immediately ("dire mission") and escalate causally: wrong frequency triggers violent ice response, forcing Kaelen’s adjustment. Cost is visceral (panic seizing him) and shapes tactics (shutting out visual data). Agency-driven escalation narrows options to one choice—harmonizing—but the emotional toll lacks deeper physical or relational consequence beyond the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (patient revolution vs impatience) tighten through sensory accumulation; cost crystallizes in "slough away" moment; agency as vigilant witnessing forecloses impulsive action under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten when entangled memories fuse historical/modern oppression, narrowing Elara’s options to an unorthodox report. Agency drives escalation: her choice to interpret resonance as preventable death (societal chains) over physical barriers. Conceptual cost lands in "forced them to seek dangerous freedom," legible in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten when static forces Fix’s "desperate whim" with the kaleidoscope, narrowing options to improvisation. Agency drives escalation (curiosity → transliteration), and conceptual cost is legible via the "soul-resonance," though personal stakes could deepen the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten causally as numbers unlock deeper layers, but the conceptual cost (erased consciousness) feels abstract until the transmission. Elara's agency drives escalation, yet the cost lacks visceral immediacy—her reaction ("stared," "sat back") misses physical embodiment of the horror she uncovers.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake (ice floe/cliff threat) tightens into avalanche timeline via Elara's agency. Pressure coheres causally: mirror reconstruction directly enables village mobilization. Cost is unmistakable—"battered, remained" and expended effort—reconfiguring her "static peace" understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (fear→seeking endings) escalates via snowbound stillness, narrowing options to pure listening. Cost—relinquishing death wish—is visible in final hand-opening. Agency in volunteering choice tightens pressure, though disaster relief mechanics could deepen tactics slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (reconciling past love with land devotion) tightens via parallel-drawing method; agency crystallizes in crumble choice. Cost (transformed "always") legible in final image. One tightening suffices for length but reflection dominates escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation tightens through protagonist agency: prophet's approach forces ritual acceleration, and parapet manipulation narrows options. Cost (ongoing fragility of preserved wisdom) is felt in "sank beneath the sand," but time pressure lacks a live clock to heighten tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (transmuting pain) tighten via Elara’s agency gathering descendants, but cost remains conceptual; felt cost of collective despair isn’t dramatized through a specific loss altering tactics during escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through memory density as Elara shifts from decoder to witness, but the janitor's immediate conversion resolves the "world forgot to listen" conflict too cleanly—escalation needs grittier resistance to earn the conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: her method (driftwood/chalk) creates the path to the plinth, then the vision's loss forces renunciation. The cost—"leaving only the tidal longing, vast and empty"—is visceral and legible under the Accumulative lens, reweighting her entire quest.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten via atmospheric pressure: the seismic event transforms an experiment into a last shot, narrowing options to one trigger. Cost is legible in the "profound luminous ache of [Earth’s] loss" as the station tears apart—visceral and inescapable.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate via protagonist agency: Elara’s shift from guitar to vinyl-scratch singing narrows options when Mr. Gable strains against "broken" song, with visible cost (his tear-traced recognition) tightening the "flawless goodbye" goal into earned peace.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stake tightening via reconstruction is driven by agency, yet escalation lacks meaningful cost escalation. Weeks-long montage flattens pressure; no tactical shift from lost time or resources.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.6)
    Single dominant stake ("share light without fire") tightens through polishing deepening; agency in her renunciation of torches forecloses prior path with felt cost ("watching was over"); escalation driven by protagonist's micro-choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Kael’s charm offering, deepening rather than reversing Elara’s journey; cost is visceral in her trembling proffer ("amber burning") as she trades isolation for shared vulnerability under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Kaelen’s agency: his "desperate attempt" method fails until the woman’s story deepens his knowledge, forcing renunciation of cameo collecting. Cost legible in "walking back toward the world"—abandoning old identity for writing against doubt. Hybrid escalation perfect: accumulation of sensory details (mist, light, shell) reweights "hope" from abstract to actionable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes crystallize around capturing ephemeral grief permanently. Escalation driven by protagonist's agency: petal arrangement triggers starlight flare, raising cost (only one chance). "Cold and brilliant" fire and depleted starlight deliver felt cost under Accumulative lens. Single tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: studying reflection angles transforms abstract "harvest of echoes" into actionable blueprint, foreclosing replication path. Cost crystallizes in "wounded season" context—preservation succeeds but decay persists, reweighting victory through tangible environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven purely by protagonist's internal state under Accumulative lens: panic-induced misalignment intensifies calcification, with cost legible in "thin, delicate lace of mineralized grief" reweighting the burden-collection premise.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (containing grief within art's boundaries) tightens via kettle's timeframe forcing decisive choice. Agency in rejecting literal lion carving for cupped hand narrows options with felt cost. Escalation subtle but coherent under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten under Accumulative lens: each *click* narrows options (final crystal becomes unavoidable), with agency driving escalation (she "almost didn’t turn it" but presses on). The cost—realizing ambition was misdirected—materializes physically in the inert wheel and emotionally in "sharp regret," reweighting the lagoon's meaning without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake (resurrection vs demolition) tightens through Elara's agency: carnival's capacitors become crucial resource. Cost is visceral ("gears groaned") and reconfigures options when walls move, though moral calculus could deepen slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: her presentation of sheet music deepens the stake (redefining composition as listening). Cost unmistakable when notes transform—surrendering dream’s form but not essence. Tightening forecloses "loud" path while altering understanding, though bear’s arrival edges on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes viscerally felt through physical reactions ("frantic drum"), but escalation lacks meaningful resistance beyond environmental decay. Conceptual cost legible though pressure tightens only once.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: coaxing secret from silence intensifies via sensory density until fulgurite reveals living memory; cost legible in physical endurance and years of failed attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen meaningfully when the carpet thread metaphor transforms abstract healing into tangible cost ("without it... unravel"), but pressure lacks active resistance—Elias merely receives wisdom rather than driving escalation through agency.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes ("to prove scars can sing") deepen through the grafting process, but escalation relies on revelation rather than protagonist-driven pressure; the hum's conceptual cost reweights meaning, yet agency in tightening options remains passive during the pivotal sound revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency—sidereal patience narrows options to celestial alignment, with visible cost in the box’s fading light. Geese returns mark a live clock, deepening pressure under accumulative lens without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate under Accumulative lens as probe’s scan forces Elara to transform her non-interference rule. Agency is clear (initiating transit, weaving signal), with conceptual cost legible in breaking generational patterns to preserve the garden’s essence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure escalates through Accumulative lens via sensory density ("river of Monarchs," "chorus of murmurs") narrowing options to retrace ribbons; cost legible in "rain would run down the letters like tears," though migration timeframe lacks tactical urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (community discord vs. geological harmony) tighten through inscription density under Accumulative lens. Agency in microscopic corrections forecloses the path of heroic fix, but visible cost ("weight on his soul") leans slightly abstract without a concrete loss like time or tool sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes ("shape of intentions") never tighten meaningfully; discovery unfolds passively without opposition or tactical shift—pressure accumulates but lacks agency-driven escalation required for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through Silas's agency: rejecting the "safe prediction" for the anomaly forces a trade-off (surrender vs. revolution). Cost is unmistakable—"risking everything" crystallizes in the "air crackled" tension before writing, narrowing options to one irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (breaking story famine) tightens via her realization that "cloak" means nurture, narrowing options to transmission. Cost—her identity shift—is legible, but conservatory discovery lacks meaningful obstacle, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency—his sedimentary method forces confrontation with the impact scar, narrowing options to rewrite history or accept state lies.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.9)
    Stakes tighten through Eliza’s agency as she isolates altos and guides Leo’s breath—each subtraction forecloses options while escalating the "vanishing arts" cost; the felt price of the program’s end permeates the final harmony’s quiet victory without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate via celestial alignment deadline (tightening tactics), but customers’ transformations lack visible cost—nurse’s "certainty" feels unearned without prior struggle. Elara’s personal cost (hollow past resolved) remains potent.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten to irrevocable trade-off (city lights vs food) through Arawn's agency—diagnosing hive link, interpreting riddle. Cost is visceral in "no power to give the city," though blackout urgency lacks a live clock intensifying tactics.

    Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens; cost of shifting from observation to participation unmistakable in consecration beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is driven solely by Veridian’s agency: each micro-choice (shifting coral, dislodging stone) narrows options under mounting psychic pressure, with the self-shattering act imposing a visceral, irreversible cost that reconfigures the dominant stake (prison vs liberation) in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten via moonlight pressure (brush glow → luminous script), but escalation leans on coincidence (stranger's return) rather than protagonist-driven agency under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through lens thawing: physical act forecloses preservation-only path with visible cost (dread transforming into resolve). Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens, though beekeeper absence isn’t leveraged enough for secondary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate causally from tidal race to world unraveling, but oxygen thinning remains observational—no visible physiological cost (e.g., choking) to charge the final image under causal lens pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (orchard survival) tightens through Kaelen’s agency: dubbing transforms destructive energy into harmony. Cost is visceral in "arm aching, breath ragged gasps" after storm passes. Escalation driven purely by protagonist’s sonic choices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency: gate rust → pattern studies → crack opportunity. Cost unmistakable in "fractured plate" and "dwindling resources" tightening tactics. One decisive deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Silas’ agency: the ledger’s dead end forces his "alternative hypothesis," narrowing options to the stamp. Cost is undeniable—the conceptual price of truth (sanitized history exposed) reshapes his final stance within the reclaimed stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (capturing shadow's essence) tightens via soul-cost escalation. Pressure coherent under Accumulative lens but Keeper scene lacks meaningful opposition; cost visible in lightness/loss trade-off during descent.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s agency: pulling the brass bar triggers projection, then aligning the chip drives the CR. Cost is her worldview shattered—contract becomes sacred duty—with escalation under accumulative lens via the resonant hum’s physical/psychic toll, narrowing options to "teach them how to listen."

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: sifting carvings (crest, shipwreck) accumulates pressure under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to confession. Cost is unmistakable—the client’s "manufactured pride" crumbling and Elara’s "clean" regret foreclose her deceitful trade. Dominant stake (quelling obsession vs. truth) tightens coherently to the breaking point.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Kael’s token reveals shared ownership of the mistake, forcing Elara’s realization. But moon-phase synchronization doesn’t actively narrow options—it’s atmospheric timing, not protagonist-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.3)

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation via density increase: saucer vision shifts from cloudbound repentance (cosmic regret) to golden glow (intimate moments), narrowing options through protagonist agency; "choking beauty" evolution charges final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes stay abstract (understanding "texture" vs. tangible loss); escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening. The detour feels fated, not agentic, and coincidence (prophecy fulfillment) resolves pressure without Elara’s active trade-off, violating the lens guardrail for Accumulative designs.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation through Lysander’s methodical agency under blackout pressure; Vorlag’s withheld sword draw narrows options with palpable cost in her conflicted expression.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (smuggling hope) escalates via coffee tin discovery, narrowing options. Cost is visceral: Silas's molt now purposeful evolution. Slight deduction as smuggling execution occurs off-page, softening peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by Kaelen’s agency: needle spinning wildly forces him to diffuse sorrow via lace, narrowing options to "breathe where thread looped." Cost is visceral—"surge of cold, blue sorrow threatened to overwhelm"—and reshapes his final bonsai work as silent testament.
