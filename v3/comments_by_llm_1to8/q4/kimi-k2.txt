  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: one wing becomes twelve, forming "a gradient from vivid to ashen." The stake—understanding catastrophic versus gradual change—deepens as Mara recognizes the butterflies "had not died in fire but in retreat." Cost appears in the species' documented decline and her shifted worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from survival (the attempt on her life) through discovery (following frost patterns) to moral choice (vengeance vs. remembrance). The protagonist's agency drives each turn—reading the ledger, following frost, placing the shard—with the final cost being acceptance of loss rather than pursuit of revenge, though the truncated ending slightly dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into perceivable music—escalates through Rowan's methodical placement of forks and construction of prisms. The tension builds appropriately under the accumulative lens, though the lack of opposing force or complication keeps this from higher bands. Cost is visible in the emptied case and Rowan's bow.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (giving the unburied rest) signals early and deepens when Elias discovers he must include his own name. The library's collapse creates genuine pressure forcing completion. Cost is visible in bleeding fingers and self-inscription, though middle escalation could tighten further - the discovery of names feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from individual survival to collective identity ("declare that we are still a people") with the seeds representing future possibility. The sanctions create persistent pressure throughout. Cost is visible in the exile condition and resource scarcity, though the anonymous donations slightly soften the immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: memory surfaces → tear warms → pilgrim appears → touch through camera → integration. The dominant stake (healing the distance between past/present selves) tightens through mystical intensification. Cost is visible in the "cracked bowl" and "unused love" transformation, though agency feels somewhat passive.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking understanding to accepting dissolution. The halo fragment's increasing brightness and the photographs' accelerating decay create mounting pressure. Elara's agency drives the transformation—she chooses to enter the mirrored corridor and knead time despite disintegration.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds causally from decoding → escaping chains → retrieving seeds → evading guards → planting. The arrow with stormbird fletching provides agency to break chains and create the barrier. Cost is legible in the spent arrow and discarded chains, with the final vulnerable position amplifying stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulating absences into the mosaic until the brother's memory triggers recognition of trust's true sound—not crack but hush. The protagonist's renunciation of the device carries clear cost. Stakes deepen appropriately for the textural mode though physical pressure remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from individual portrait theft to the accumulation in the jar becoming "heavy with stolen radiance," forcing the choice between keeping or releasing. The moonflower code system creates concrete pressure as she must evade the guard. Cost appears in releasing what she's gathered, though the middle lacks a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether Mara can overcome her pattern of abandonment—deepens through discovering the maps and committing to build rather than flee. Cost appears in her recognition that staying requires vulnerability ("knowing that the first safe zone would begin with her own willingness to stay"). The escalation from cleaning to discovering to deciding follows accumulative logic, though the tension could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from identity crisis through archaeological discovery to direct confrontation. The dominant stake (reclaiming authentic identity from studio manipulation) tightens as each revelation narrows options. The protagonist's phobia creates genuine tension during the rooftop climb, and burning the contracts forecloses the old life with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through accumulating silence-types from simple (thunderclap pause) to ancient (predating language), with the final dot spreading to black as decisive deepening. The oracle's agency drives each catalogued silence, and releasing the star shows clear trade-off: completing the map requires accepting endless night.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through three loops: ignore → destroy → understand/integrate, each deepening J-9's engagement with guilt. The dominant stake (confronting vs. suppressing guilt) tightens as J-9 realizes the program is "refinement" not "rehabilitation." Cost is legible: carrying the violin "not as a burden but as a lens" shows permanent transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from solitary observation to discovering fraud to choosing reconciliation, with the lens-decoded message forcing the protagonist's decision. The predecessor's descent and ledger presentation show agency-driven escalation. Cost is visible in "twenty years" of concealment, though the resolution's ease ("neither grip questions presence") slightly undercuts the accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation reads through accumulative density—each marble story increases pressure until the split marble triggers the wisteria's resurrection. The queen's device cracking mirrors the marble's fracture, making cost visible. The garden's response ("paths shortening") shows earned resolution through Lira's accumulated authority.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from private experiment to physical danger as "the holographic tunnel began to collapse" forces Lira to sprint back. The dominant stake—proving lateral time to reconnect with her brother—tightens when she must choose between staying in the sideways corridor or returning to linear time. Cost manifests in accepting incomplete connection rather than full recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates through water rising to Mara's knees, lanterns dimming "as if the house itself inhaled," and the ghost's silhouette appearing. The deepening occurs when Mara realizes "the code was not to be read but performed" and tilts her clarinet to complete the final glyph. Cost manifests in her physical risk and the identity merger glimpsed in the prima donna reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: oracle's arrival → gentian revelation about glacier loss → shared tower climb → mutual confession → transformation. The dominant stake (confronting climate silence) tightens when Elias deliberately smudges the glacier outline, accepting revision. Cost is visible in the "4.7 grams" weight and the final atmospheric shift, though the conflict could push harder against resistance before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from Jonah's confession to the wheel's discovery, through the layered psychic voices to the revelation of weights (137 grams/tongue, 21 grams/soul). The cost becomes legible when Mara physically holds "her brother's swallowed truth, dense as lead, hot as grief" before releasing it.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (witnessing change without judgment versus dissolution) signals early and deepens through accumulative pressure as the keeper releases seasons into silence. The tension between preserving and releasing tightens once when he must fold moments back into the swan before it stiffens. However, lacks a sharp reversal or decisive tightening that forecloses options; the keeper's agency remains observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—restoring wonder through connection—escalates from Lila's solitary arrival through Rowan's emergence, their musical exchange during totality, to his first words. The cost is tangible: Lila surrenders her precious keepsake to forge this healing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating diary discoveries, each adding pressure until Elara finds her own unremembered diary, forcing the question "If walls remember, do they also forgive?" The cost manifests in her relinquishing her role as collector. Stakes deepen appropriately for the textural lens, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal stagnation to systemic change as Lin moves from passive fortune-writer to active broadcaster. The pistol moment provides genuine pressure. Cost is visible in the mainland's reconfiguration. However, Mara's quick conversion feels slightly under-motivated despite the tears detail.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative layering—each recorded silence adds rhetorical weight until the demon must choose between accepting constructed quiet or remaining outside. The cost manifests in the priest's drained palette and lost shimmer, with the demon's dissolution carrying clear consequence for both entities.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each mapped memory intensifies the shell's response—from "low hum" to glowing chambers to the lake cracking. The dominant stake (accessing childhood's unheard symphonies) tightens as "tomorrow's exhaustion already reaching for her wrists" creates urgency. Cost is visible when exhaustion finally claims her as she completes the transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through algorithmic degradation—from infinite variation to "running out of variations, looping the same cracked marble"—forcing confrontation with the unchangeable (mother's death). The cost manifests physically as gravity returns "in a rush of blood and memory" and psychologically as she abandons the compulsion to undo. One meaningful deepening that forecloses the path of endless retracing.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative ritual—from threading the useless needle through copper, to stretching skin, to the drum's creation, to Mara striking it and experiencing reversed memories. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens as each step builds toward her transformation, with cost visible in accepting permanent deafness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—whether to share dangerous knowledge about the quarantine breach—escalates from being followed to sensing the watcher to making the decisive choice to enable discovery. Liora's agency drives the resolution through deliberate action ("With deliberate lateral motion she shifted three stones"). Cost manifests in releasing control of information that could endanger others. The follower's pressure could be more concrete to fully tighten options.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving vs. releasing memory) deepens through Elian's realization that "every fragrance he had brokered had been a seed planted in strangers' hearts." The release decision carries visible cost in abandoning his trade. Escalation is more textural than causal, appropriate to the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation occurs through deepening discovery rather than external conflict: each rope layer reveals higher stakes (fear, love, cosmic wind). The pressure intensifies from playful investigation to the weight of "what impossible choice will you make now?" The cost becomes legible when the poet must choose between leaving the question knotted forever or risking unraveling tomorrow—resolved through his third option of revision.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of proving "what fire had begun, human breath could complete" escalates through accumulative pressure as the hush responds—first stirring, then fracturing into possibility, finally following her home. The transformation from silence to music-in-potential carries clear cost in her abandoned violin, though the middle section could tighten the pressure points where resistance shifts to receptivity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through static electricity intensifying to violet filament binding, with Vale's defenses progressively dissolving under accumulative pressure. The reversal when the buyer refuses the product and asks for Vale's survival formula creates meaningful tightening, though the final convergence feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of acknowledging invisible labor is signaled early and develops through the mistaken letter. However, escalation plateaus after the trio forms their pact - subsequent beats add participants but don't meaningfully tighten pressure. The locket's return provides emotional payoff but arrives without sufficient complication to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of artistic isolation versus community connection established early and deepens through shared search and collaborative creation. The tightening occurs when multiple artists converge to transform Arbor's static tag into living art. Cost is legible in Lira's tears and the vulnerability of her tiny signature, though escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from needing to draw echoes to actively stealing time from the sleeping giant, with the interrupted cadence creating urgency. The dominant stake (completing the bestiary before the giant wakes) tightens when Lira must choose to subtract time from the giant's nap. Cost manifests in the mirrors showing her future in an empty city and the weight of the captured birthplace.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen effectively from stealing the eyes to confronting her sister's ambiguous loss, with the ritual's progression (placing eyes, water drop, tree's response, fern unfurling) creating meaningful escalation. The cost is legible when Lira accepts she cannot retrieve her sister but can transform her relationship to grief.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest (finding the fragment) to enabling connection for another lost soul, with Lira sacrificing her collected treasure. The power outages create time pressure and opportunity windows. Cost is visible when she gives up "lullaby II" she just secured, foreclosing her plan to wait for seven fragments.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulating pressure: from studying plant behaviors to witnessing unwilled metamorphosis to accepting her own transformation. The storm's escalation ("Tonight the sky wanted it back") forces stance crystallization with cost paid in releasing fifteen years of guarded control.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accumulates through the tidal urgency and Ishka's recognition of the brooch's significance, tightening when the stranger appears with his impossible canvas. The exchange forecloses her path of painting "every lesion of light," though the stakes could feel more visceral in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: the pearl's transformation, multiplication of selves, and the cave's morphing intensify stakes. The clairvoyant's loss of foresight and the pilgrim's confrontation with accumulated darkness create genuine tension. Cost is visible in tears, physical dissolution ("fingers passed through"), and the final admission of not seeing the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation as Mara moves from reading individual absences to assembling a "lexicon of leavings" that ultimately enables her to summon the returning fleet. The dominant stake—navigating absences to find meaning after exile—tightens through each discovered fragment. Cost is visible in the "trembling hand" and the implicit price of her exile term, though peak pressure could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation - from following cracks to boarding the ghost train to ascending erasure stairs. Each station brings emotional pressure through silhouette passengers representing unresolved relationships. The dominant stake (retrieving mother's sentence to understand abandonment) tightens as Elara must surrender her defensive habits to reach the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen from academic doubt to confronting personal grief through others' memories. The tile's revelation of her mother's death date ("a night Mara had spent indoors, refusing to look at the sky") crystallizes cost. Escalation tracks through accumulating memories to personal reckoning, though middle sections could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from internal (boredom) through spatial danger (escondite's collapse threatening to "scatter her across uncountable nowheres") to emotional revelation. The solar storm adds external pressure while Veyra's manipulation creates cascading instability. Cost is visible but the resolution's ease slightly undermines the established danger.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating pressure: from waiting for the director, to the moment of suspicion ("eyes to paper cuts"), to exploiting the "momentary eclipse of vigilance," culminating in the irrevocable stamp. The cost is legible in Lila's acceptance of complicity and her future disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving memory against encroaching silence—intensifies as the lamp begins "forgetting its own past." Liang's panic and urgent speaking of market-day textures represents meaningful escalation. The cost manifests through the lamp's death and the "thicker" silence that returns, though the story could push the physical consequences of this preservation work harder.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulation: from collecting fragments to the label growing warm to discovering the room of jarred sounds, each deepening the narrator's integration with erased histories. The final dissolution into "the space between stories" carries conceptual cost (identity erasure), though more visceral pressure in the middle third would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: the hums intensifying, the shell glowing, then cracking to reveal the copper wire. The dominant stake—understanding the relationship between myth and truth—deepens when she discovers her mother was also a myth buster. Cost is visible in bleeding fingers and the shell's destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: corporate survey glyphs appear, artists respond overnight, Lila decodes their resistance, then actively participates by painting the maze that traps the buyers. The stakes—privatization versus perpetual carnival—remain clear throughout, though the final confrontation could sharpen the immediate cost of defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—photographing the last ghost orchid before extinction—is signaled early and tightens through the countdown structure. Agency manifests through deliberate choices: calibrating the timer, embedding the grain, steadying for the shot. The seven-minute bloom window creates genuine pressure that forecloses options, and the cost is legible when the violet flash matches the orchid's bloom—both beautiful and terminal.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes are clear—rescue team's survival depends on drone repair before ship departure. The Orion's whistle creates genuine time pressure that accelerates Mara's actions. However, the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off; success comes without significant sacrifice beyond accepting her perpetual role.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating water patterns: static condensation→trembling bead→darker ice line→open water circle. The pressure coheres around finding the river's source before disappearing, with visible cost when Lira steps onto water that could swallow her like her predecessor.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes emerge through accumulation: each footfall rebuilds rhythm, each resonance draws more participants, culminating in the living/dead convergence. The escalation from solo walk to full procession to autonomous continuation shows clear deepening under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the blurred boundary between past/present, though agency reads more as facilitation than active choice.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: Mara chooses to sacrifice her most precious memory despite wanting to preserve it. Cost unmistakable: "her mother's last smile—begin to fade from her mind" in exchange for "the ability to hold any future instant, once, perfectly." The tightening oxygen counter (43→31→20 minutes) forces decision without allowing retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to confronting generational trauma, with the labyrinth sequence forcing Leif to witness and integrate painful truths. The cost is visible in the fused lattice ring and his transformation. Some middle passages could tighten the pressure more directly rather than through abstract imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation—each nightly visit adds "resonant awakenings" until the debt reaches its tipping point. The ghost bride's agency drives the resolution through her choice to forgive, with clear cost in their mutual dissolution. Pressure coheres under the textural lens as memories accumulate through the trees' network, though the conflict could tighten slightly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—mending the pattern of ruin—deepens through Lira's nightly walks as the labyrinth responds with increasing intensity: walls shifting, dust settling, corners softening. The escalation from unconscious sleepwalking to conscious weaving shows agency, with visible cost in the fourteen-night commitment and the canyon's final sealing that forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen from personal return to communal healing as the protagonist realizes "the interrupted journeys were not only hers" but belong to all displaced souls. The escalation from cleaning museum marble to excavating actual bones among warned-against roots shows agency confronting increasing resistance, with the seven-day vigil representing sustained commitment despite isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving authentic meaning through slow correspondence) accumulates pressure through ritual steps: arriving early, chalking symbols, hesitating at blank margins, final mailing. The cost manifests in vulnerability—revealing "every alias" and "the one afternoon she had felt real." While lacking sharp reversals, the accumulative deepening through chalk additions and the final backward walk shows meaningful stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (preventing the coup) escalates through the candle's eastward lean revealing the deadline, creating time pressure that drives Mira's frantic unstitching and re-embroidering. Cost is visible in the blood drops and the risk of discovery. The tightening occurs when footsteps approach and she must maintain her disguise while working faster, though the resolution lacks a final test of her deception.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative ritual stages: shard placement, letter unfolding, blood-writing the unwritten apology. The dominant stake—confronting seven years of regret—tightens as each letter transforms from burden to release, with palpable cost in "I was afraid choosing you meant losing myself."

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake—Lin's guilt and need for connection with her brother—develops through accumulation rather than escalation. The decryption of the cast provides a meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding of the children's shared trauma. However, the pressure doesn't fully tighten toward a forced choice; Lin's decision to plant the coral feels voluntary rather than compelled.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation through accumulative deepening: from touching fragment→projecting light→painting with sunbeams→orchard resisting ("branches creaking warnings")→final transformation with "real blossoms from trees that had been dead." The cost is legible as fog "already gathering again at the edges" shows the temporary nature of restored joy.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: colors awakening in nested layers, the hobo's emergence, Lila's certainty peeling away, culminating in her choice to become future pigment. Cost is legible (abandoning her profession's permanence). The tension between restoration and conversation provides coherent pressure, though the hobo's arrival feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from individual message-passing to city-wide botanical rebellion, with auditor-mimics creating immediate physical threat. The warp mechanism provides clear tightening as the cipher shifts mid-operation. Cost manifests through Lysander accepting potential self-immolation ("spark might burn the hand"), though the truncated ending prevents full cost articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative pressure: from nightly postcard rituals to vine-growing to dream-meeting with the sister. The armistice concept evolves from external treaty to internal reconciliation, with visible cost in "tears that tasted of magnesium and regret." While the centuries-long timeframe diffuses traditional escalation, the pattern of transformation—postcard sprouting, vine thickening, chapbook binding—creates meaningful deepening that narrows the poet's options toward acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cracked bamboo tube creates genuine pressure—"without resonance the name would die a second death"—and the caretaker's search for the original sound escalates through multiple attempts. The final cost lies in confronting her own forgotten name, though the resolution feels slightly predetermined by the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: silence → writing promises → music spreading → confrontation → public declaration. The deadline pressure ("demolition at dawn") creates urgency that tightens choices. Cost is visible in the shattered inkwell and three months of professional silence, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from measuring infrastructure to decoding coordinates to risking catastrophic eruption versus valley starvation, with the lever engagement forcing a precise calibration between extremes. The tension peaks when "any floodgate opened too wide would fracture the caldera, yet any gate left closed would starve the valley," making Lira's millimeter-precise solution carry genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through the cat killing the youngest pigeon, triggering Liora's week of document rewriting - a clear tightening that narrows her relationship with truth. The boy's letter with "a photograph of a bombed concert hall" forces final confrontation. Cost is visible in releasing the meteorite chip and burning the documents, though escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes build through Iona's analysis and risk-taking descent from terrace to maze floor. The dominant stake (reuniting with father/understanding sacred thresholds) tightens when she steps onto the glass rail. Cost is visible in the three-harvest separation, though the maze's convenient opening after the weather code recitation feels slightly unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of finding belonging intensifies through the city's responsive awakening, from passive observation to active resonance when she speaks its name "Astralethe." The cost manifests as she accepts carrying the city's music while leaving it behind, though the middle section could tighten its pressure between feather placement and city response.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through each seed's revelation: from "why" to the bird's memory to Lira's own childhood connection. The escalation from seeking physical paths to understanding emotional essence represents meaningful accumulative pressure. The cost manifests in accepting perpetual questions rather than finding definitive answers.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of transforming monotony through orchestrated randomness escalates through Finch's calculated moves: bishop placement, twelve-tone humming, marble juggling, each building pressure toward the triangular configuration. The resolution emerges from his deliberate choreography with visible effects on multiple lives, though the lack of resistance or complication keeps escalation smooth rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from private dance to garden awakening to bodily transformation. The moonstone's dissolution releases stored lullabies that surface as constellations, each step deepening commitment. The cost is legible in her permanent transformation and isolation, though the external pressure of the ban could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: finding the atrium, installing glass, witnessing transformation. The noctilucent clouds create natural time pressure. Cost is visible in Elowen's choice to leave her treasured panes behind, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external opposition testing her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from walking to kneeling, opening the box, speaking aloud, then releasing colors that spell "forgive." The dominant stake (translating guilt into universal language) deepens as memory ignites and pain becomes prism, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as density increase through accelerating balloon launches and growing pattern complexity, appropriate for the accumulative lens. The stakes (transforming despair into hope across timelines) deepen when Lira recognizes the recursive nature of her experiment. Cost becomes visible in the gauge cracking and the grotto's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: each diary fragment and echo deepens understanding of "legacy's burden." The film negative strip's transformation from keepsake to key shows meaningful tightening. Cost appears in grandfather's protective silence and Mara's acceptance of memory-keeping duty, though the emotional price could be more visceral in the moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes intensify through the borrowed heartbeat's precarity—"Without it, the painter's own pulse faltered"—creating genuine mortal pressure. The escalation follows accumulative logic as she progresses from touching locket to stone, to singing the coded lullaby, to dancing with arms wide, each action deepening her commitment. The cost manifests in the heartbeat's final "skip" before permanent internalization.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—redemption through ritual transformation—intensifies as Kelis arrives unexpectedly, forcing Aurelia to confront her specific harm. The ritual's wordless constraint creates genuine pressure. However, the escalation relies more on accumulation than decisive turns, and Kelis's forgiveness arrives somewhat easily without visible struggle on his part.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation works through accumulating pressure: from walking with the egg, to discovering the spiral, to pouring the contraband water, to the egg's response triggering the river's return. Each action narrows Lira's options until she must choose between preserving her drought empire or allowing restoration, with the cost explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal summons to collective liberation as Lys unravels each thread, releasing stored voices. The resistance of the threads "coiling like a serpent" creates genuine tension. The sanctuary's destruction and Lys's absorption of the prism represents meaningful cost, though the empire's response remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through layered puppet performances that mirror and transform the smugglers/revolutionaries conflict, culminating in audience participation that shifts agency from performer to collective. The tyrant's reversed speech creating "FORGIVENESS" provides the key tightening moment, with cost visible in the pilot's tears and Lucien's vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake of preserving overlooked histories deepens through the monarch's torn wing becoming the moth wing memorial, with meaningful tightening when Lira must accept three-day dissolution. Cost is visible in the physical constraint of impermanence and emotional price of "embarrassment at her own need to commemorate." The tension between remembering and forgetting escalates through concrete choices rather than abstract meditation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes intensify from physical (entering sanctum) through emotional (confronting guilt) to transformative (restoring names through new medium). The rope's reconfiguration represents irreversible choice with clear cost. Escalation follows the accumulative pattern as each recovered name adds weight. The final bell-casting decision crystallizes agency—she chooses restoration over erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The decaying directive's transformation from order to prophecy to signature creates meaningful escalation. Foresight's discovery that she is the message rather than interpreter forces a genuine trade-off—maintaining identity versus fulfilling purpose. The storm's hunger and the directive's decay create effective time pressure, though one more concrete obstacle could strengthen the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake - ensuring cosmic order continues - escalates through Naram-Sin's methodical investigation, with the tile's patterns gradually revealing the palace's secret. The cost becomes visceral when he must sacrifice "all the nights he might have spent naming new comets." The tension between his frugality/empiricism and the mystical covenant creates authentic pressure that narrows to a single irreversible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from silencing war drums to releasing personal resentment to transforming an entire battlefield. The pin's transformation from broken to whole to seed shows meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in Lira aging within the sanctuary and soldiers' "resentment draining like spilled wine."

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative breathing patterns that deepen from "deliberate stroke" to full synchronization with the moth's heartbeat, narrowing the boundary between maker and made. The cost manifests in the mirror maker having to abandon her entire previous practice, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: wound-mending leads to grandmother's face appearing, then daughter's childhood memory, culminating in wrist-binding reconciliation. The dominant stake (generational healing) tightens as each climb reveals deeper emotional territory, with visible cost in accepting the "sweet rot" rather than perfect resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from pursuing knowledge to discovering the cyclical trap to accepting eternal guardianship, with each revelation narrowing Elara's options. The dominant stake (gaining forbidden knowledge versus losing oneself) intensifies through concrete costs—seeing her future self weeping, vomiting stardust, memories peeling away. The final choice to become guardian carries visible price, though middle pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from rescue mission to fundamental renegotiation of humanity's relationship with knowledge. The guardian's demand for proof creates genuine pressure. Cost is clear in Elara's decision to stay. Slight deduction for abstract philosophical negotiation that could use more visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as the ship dissolves and the fog erases the garden's names "as fast as they bloomed." The protagonist faces a genuine dilemma: "To stay was to forget; to leave was to lose her again." The final choice between caught names ("Stay" vs "Go") crystallizes this tension with visible cost as the ship sinks.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from discovering an impossible door to recovering lost history that reshapes academic understanding. The rope-braiding creates tangible pressure as time reverses and the mechanism responds. Cost is legible in the fractured scholarship being healed and borders being restored.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding silence's true nature—intensifies through the mapkeeper's interaction with the energy being and her eventual surrender of control. The cost manifests in her tears and the scoring of "not a boundary but a bridge" on her skin-map. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes her maps "had always been incomplete," forcing her to reconfigure her entire practice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the shard of hush's threat to "swallow her" and the methodical pressure of aligning fractures with lost names. The dominant stake—proving coincidence has meaning—tightens as each pattern leads to the next necessary step. Cost manifests in binding personal losses to cosmic repair.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from archiving selective memories to confronting collective trauma when the thirty-three stone shadow reveals the suppressed plague year. The deepening pressure forces Lira's choice between comfortable curation and painful completeness, with cost visible when she writes "the weight of unmarked coffins" and the monument transforms.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal defiance to collective liberation as "travelers who had lost their way looked up and felt the gravity of hopelessness slip off." The kerosene rag becomes key through discovery of its purpose. Cost is visible in sacrificing her performance tool. Could strengthen the middle pressure point between discovery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake of family fracture deepens through the cicada's revelation of the unmailed letter, forcing siblings to confront their mother's choice. Mara's arrival escalates pressure ("can't bear another silence"). Cost is visible in tears salting the stone and the suspended conversation, though agency remains somewhat passive.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: collecting silence flavors → teaching father → transforming the bunker's alarms. The dominant stake (freedom vs. confinement) tightens when Lira must choose to return. Cost is visible in the father's tears and years of waiting, though the final resolution lacks some friction.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads through density increase and pattern shifts in the storm glass - from snowflake to rain to luminous particles. The child's sigh catalyzes transformation with visible cost in tears. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length, though the stakes could press harder.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through time pressure (sunrise deadline) and deepening revelation—from finding a stairway to understanding she must build it from narrative, to accepting the throne's true nature. The Regency Drones provide external pressure while internal conflict builds through memory accumulation. Cost manifests in her final isolation, sealed within the orchard she fought to reach.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.6)
    Escalation occurs through accumulation as shadows gather and the protagonist breathes them in, teaching herself "to breathe through absence." The pressure builds from external shadows encroaching to internal transformation. The cost of severed connections is present but could tighten more decisively in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates through textural accumulation: glitchy texts → spore apparition → physical compression → diamond formation. The dominant stake (transforming guilt into something valuable) tightens when Mara must choose between gaming the system or accepting genuine transformation, with clear cost in releasing her sales instincts.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to complete her mission to end the dynasty—is signaled early and tightens when the revelation forces Lira to choose between destruction and transformation. The standing wave mechanism provides coherent pressure building to her decision. Cost is visible in her renunciation of her trained purpose, though the conflict could have benefited from more immediate opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation follows accumulative pattern: discovery leads to recognition, then puppet animation, memory recovery, and finally merger. The dominant stake (fulfilling the forgotten oath) deepens through each beat. Cost manifests in the irreversible transformation where "the boundary between knight and effigy dissolving."

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with abandonment through preserving others' stories—deepens through the button discovery and J's photograph. The protagonist's agency manifests in choosing to photograph the Polaroid, carry the button, and forgive her father, with visible cost in "the way soldiers once carried buttons into battle, proof that someone waited on the other side of the unknown."

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal (carrying fragments) through tactical (evading drones) to collective (broadcasting histories). The boy's appearance raises tension without forced confrontation. Cost is visible in Lira's learned stillness and banked fire, though the actual broadcast feels slightly too easy given the established surveillance state.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission to valley-wide catastrophe prevention, with the protagonist's agency driving the resolution through his choice to "whisper through negative space." The cost manifests as a lifetime commitment to learning absence rather than presence, though the middle lacks one clear tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to existential transformation as leaves reveal increasing urgency ("whoever reads it will become the next guardian"). The dominant stake—decoding meaning before memory fails—tightens through Elian's accelerating monument-building and culminates in visible cost (bodily dissolution), though middle pressure points could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: three clocks stopping at 11:17, the compass spinning then pointing downward, the lake parting to reveal deeper descent. The dominant stake—whether to embrace uncertainty over certainty—tightens when Elian chooses to descend and transform his practice, with visible cost in letting clients' clocks run backward. The pressure coheres but could intensify more sharply at the crucial descent moment.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from seeking emptiness to performing kintsugi to speaking the name aloud, each action narrows Elara's options toward accepting rather than erasing failure. The cost manifests in the "alloyed gold and regret" she must carry. Some escalation feels more conceptual than visceral, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate from collecting individual souls to retuning an entire valley's dissonance. The collector's agency drives descent and final integration. Cost manifests in physical burden ("coat grew heavier") and emotional release ("knot...dissolving").

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the strap's tightening/loosening as Kael navigates both physical forest and psychological terrain. The Fibonacci sequence discovery provides meaningful deepening that changes his tactical approach. Cost accumulates through each wrong step until the final integration, though the resolution's ease slightly reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake of preserving/translating lost histories escalates from passive carrying to active participation when stepping through the painting. The lighthouse fragment's increasing warmth and the sister's boat-gift deepen pressure toward the final choice between following and remaining. Cost manifests in the separation and the "promise to return" that binds future action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: frost message → dust patterns → ceiling warmth → mirror revelations → final transformation. The stakes deepen from investigating ceilings to confronting time itself. Cost manifests in Mara's permanent transformation and career abandonment, though middle sections could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through whisper releases: "Farewell" creates wrong patterns, "Remember" reverses the press, then all bottles at once cause total dissolution. Each uncorking tightens the spiral toward rupture. The cost (library's destruction, operator's dissolution) is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal (Mara's guilt) through institutional (dispute over the shard) to civilizational (reimagining lost culture). The confrontation with Solenne provides the key turn where "theft" becomes "translation." However, the Company enforcers' transformation happens too easily without sufficient pressure, weakening the final escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal doubt (chip flickering) through direct confrontation with Midnight to the final bargain. The covenant fighting back creates genuine resistance. Agency manifests in Emil's choice to offer his hand rather than fight, though the resolution feels slightly swift for the scale of conflict established.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres through deepening discovery: finding compass → psychometric reading → descent to membrane → hovering at threshold. The tightening occurs when "the hinge in her chest swung open wide enough to admit the surveyor's final silence," forcing her renunciation. Cost is visible in physical strain and the conscious choice to turn back.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on rebuilding meaning after catastrophic loss ("GPS failed, world folded"). The older Mara's appearance creates meaningful pressure that forces young Mara to confront her future role. Cost is visible in the acceptance of perpetual return, though middle escalation could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding why her mother abandoned her through solving the flower mystery—deepens when the hidden postcard reframes absence as a different kind of presence. The cost lands in Liora's shift from needing answers to accepting witness, though the story could have tightened pressure through more active obstacles rather than patient accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through deepening retrocognitive immersion: from initial memory surges to "memories were louder" to the full flood of "the poet's last moment," each intensification narrowing Elara's options toward the necessary act of witness. The cost manifests physically ("staggered") and psychologically as the "retrocognitive hold" transforms into permanent "responsibility."

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether revival through imagination can replace wished-for miracles—develops through accumulation rather than reversal. Escalation occurs through deepening: from private memory to spoken blueprint to the town's physical response. The cost is clear: years of isolation, the rejection of easier comfort, and his solitary departure even as revival begins.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating revelations: silence means broken promises, the orchard itself dictates, reciprocity is required. The dominant stake (preserving connection across distance) tightens when Elowen realizes her own deafness to the living city. Cost is visible in her abandonment of the archival role.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation occurs through accumulative deepening as she moves from arrangement to breathing technique to the vortex opening, with stakes crystallizing around not tearing the membrane. The cost appears in her withdrawal and the "slower work of sealing," though pressure could tighten more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about the summons through the weight of the bell rope to accepting year-long responsibility for teaching another. The "zero hour" timing creates genuine pressure that narrows options—he must pull at the exact moment "barometric silence balanced on the edge of breaking." Cost is visible when the vortex forms and he understands he's "chosen to calibrate the sky itself," though middle sections could tighten the pressure more consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulating gestures—from placing the glass to tracing meteors to opening himself to darkness—each deepening the dominant stake of communion with abandonment. The meteors' response and transformation into seeds provides meaningful tightening, though the pressure could intensify more sharply between middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—deepens through accumulation as each ghost adds weight to the box and the recluse discovers the covenant's true nature. The escalation follows the textural lens as density increases from individual ghost encounters to collective transformation. Cost is visible in the ghosts' tears, the box's increasing weight, and their final integration into the spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation—from holding the fragment to climbing temporal stairs to breaking the snow globe, each action deepening understanding with cost. The protagonist's agency drives discovery, though the elderly woman's appearance feels slightly convenient despite the paper airplane's causal link.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from finding feather to arranging shells to writing "unfinished" to the final chest-string snap. Each tending act deepens the stake of beauty-in-incompleteness. The tide's metronome erasure creates coherent pressure that forces stance crystallization about permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation—each architectural secret raises the scope from temple to island to Mara's own dissolution into the system. The cost is legible as she "felt her own heartbeat synchronize with the slow systole of sap" while her body weakens. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a sharp reversal or narrowing that would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: static sculptures begin to move "in the way memory moves," then fully stir and converge, finally becoming "liquid narrative" that forms wings. The dominant stake—understanding "the chemistry of homecoming"—tightens as each floor reveals deeper integration of departure and return.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation—from sowing in craters to the heron's validation to the final coral pod that "would bind the submerged concord again." The dominant stake (healing the poisoned battlefield) faces real opposition in the dead reef and contaminated soil. Cost is visible in the coachman's isolation and years of patient work, though the transformation happens somewhat quickly after the heron's arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as density increase appropriate to the accumulative lens - from catching impossible scents to hearing his name to seeing the lost child. The dominant stake (translating distance into closeness) deepens through each sensory revelation. Cost is legible in accepting that memory replaces physical presence. Slightly softer middle section where pressure plateaus briefly.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through deepening understanding: confusion → exploration → active intervention, with the threshold decision crystallizing stakes. The cost of "trading exile for eternal hesitation" is explicit, and sketching as solution emerges from established family custom rather than convenience. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from stealing wonder to exchanging identity for transformation to releasing the dawn itself—each choice narrowing options with visible cost. The "cautious abandon of a man who has already lost everything and found it again" crystallizes agency. Pressure coheres through the chess game's one-move constraint and the spire's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation operates through accumulative density as Mara's walking patterns progress from "REMEMBER" to "FORGIVE" to "OBSERVE" to "STAY," each word deepening her commitment. The dominant stake—whether to preserve or release the past—tightens through her cataloging of small gestures. Cost is visible in her deliberate excision of nostalgia "the way a surgeon removes proud flesh."

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening—from cold basalt walls to the warm language stone to mercury tears—with the dominant stake (recovering lost language/home) tightening when "each word she spoke would resurrect someone the world had chosen to forget." The cost is legible but could be more viscerally dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on Arlen's need for forgiveness, with the labyrinth forcing confession through each corridor. The prodigy's appearance and king-tipping gesture provides the key reversal. Cost is visible in years of exile, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with the village's sudden animation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal defiance to collective liberation as Lysandra's poetry refracts through towers, building from single poem to cascade of forbidden stories to canyon-wide transformation. The cost is legible in permanent exile risk and the spire cracking "under the weight of so much truth," though the guards' mid-charge reversal needed more resistance to feel fully earned.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: each crater reveals deeper loss (city's attack→mother's death→master's crystallization), building toward the statue's demand to "Continue." The workshop's deterioration (mainspring cracks, hull needs mending) creates time pressure. Cost manifests in the alchemist's eternal keeper role—meaning conjured demands endless service.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening as each cave chamber intensifies the mirror motif ("reflecting his face in fragments") until the lagoon scene where pigment bleeding creates the decisive transformation. The water rising sequence generates genuine pressure with visible cost in the painter's stillness, effectively narrowing his options to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure builds through sensory accumulation toward Mara's choice to release her suppressed scream. The escalation from whisper to scream meaningfully deepens the stake. However, the village-wide instant transformation lacks sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the seven-night accumulation, each cryptic instruction deepening commitment until the moon's dark phase triggers the crucial "build the cradle that rocks backward." The bronze's temperature fluctuations create coherent pressure that forces her stance from passive grief to active construction.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: orchard's instability → compulsive truth-telling → discovery of psychological dependency → planting the eye as acceptance of risk. The cost is clear—Lira binds herself to a collapsing place. However, the psychological safety mechanism feels somewhat convenient and lacks fuller dramatization of how fear actually triggers root retraction.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulating absences ("gaps where memory should be") to the visceral alpine memory ("a boy laughing on a sunlit ridge, before the snow gives way") that transforms understanding. The keeper's shift from passive observation to active memory-bearing shows clear cost. The final promise represents genuine stance crystallization under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate from personal promise to existential choice about rewriting history. The rising creek adds temporal pressure, the doorway's offer creates genuine conflict between competing goods. Cost is explicit: "erasing every map he had ever sold, every lonely night cataloguing coastlines for strangers." The protagonist's agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with failure to prevent cosmic catastrophe—escalates through the physical climb, memory ambush at the quartz seam, and confrontation with the child-self. The transformation of bleeding starlight into "tapestry of memories" provides meaningful deepening, though the resolution feels slightly too neat given the apocalyptic setup.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes center on transforming their relationship to time and presence, with escalation through the secret's revelation and the choice to destroy rather than preserve. The crushing of the pocket-sun carries real cost, though middle sections could tighten the pressure between understanding and action.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal confusion to confronting all versions of self, culminating in burning the chronicle. The cost is legible (loss of hoarded words, bleeding thumb). However, the flying sequence slightly diffuses tension before the final confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure accumulates through textural layering—from handling the "cracked crystal reservoir" to placing the screw in the clock's heart—but lacks a sharp tightening moment. The cost of her lost sense is established early but doesn't escalate; the resolution arrives through accumulation rather than confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating physical pressure: first scar crystallizes, platform lurches, second scar forms lattice, lungs burn like molten glass. The held-breath constraint creates genuine urgency with visible cost. The tightening from individual scar to full transformation with rain arrival creates meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt to the orchard's imminent destruction, creating time pressure that forces the apology. The ghost's progression from silence to smile to dissolution shows deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost manifests in the orchard's sacrifice—"falling branches sang the newly written rest"—though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation operates through textural accumulation as the dictionary empties, the spiral tightens, and the witness fragments into "narrative possibilities." The cost manifests in surrendering individual identity to become the cosmos's self-reading consciousness, though the abstract nature of "spiral arbitration" slightly dulls the pressure's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through the shepherd's progressive discoveries: first the failed alignment, then counting backwards to find "a sliver of duration thinner than the razor edges," culminating in his choice to slow time further "not to correct but to commemorate." The cost manifests as his erasure from physical reality, though the pressure could tighten more sharply between discovery and sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake - understanding "the physics of letting go" - develops through accumulating images of permeability rather than traditional conflict escalation. The farm's transformation from defensive to inviting creates genuine pressure. The protagonist's agency manifests in choosing to scatter rather than defend, with grief as the explicit cost: "every regret loosening into spores."

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative deepening: each discovered message tightens Mara's emotional state until the rooftop revelation forces her to accept her father's philosophy. The cost is legible in her transformation from "theoretically rebellious" professor to someone who will teach "not with axioms but with a candle lantern." One meaningful deepening achieved for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: wrong numbers arrive earlier, the disc's loop grows louder and spreads through cables, Mara works faster, until "estrangement turning inside out" forces her self-dissolution. The cost is unmistakable—Mara sacrifices physical existence to become pure connective tissue.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from recording to touching the photograph, from observation to feeling the covenant "inside her chest," culminating in her staying as "the jetty lurched." The cost manifests physically as she thins into annotation, though the mystical stakes occasionally feel abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—curing loneliness through reciprocal exchange—escalates from juggling performance to the fox's instruction to final release, with the cost visible in losing the moon rock "like a pulled tooth." The magical realist elements (talking fox, humming rails) complicate without fully cohering under pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara must trust "the chain of improbable mouths," though the stakes could tighten more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (finding/naming emotional depths) escalates through accumulating sensory languages toward the stillpoint discovery. The cost manifests as transformation from mapmaker to map itself. However, the escalation relies more on deepening recognition than active pressure, and the "grief" naming feels slightly unearned without more specific grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating edits that each carry visible cost: "every kindness she sowed sprouted a new sorrow elsewhere." The pen breaking forces closure, though the conflict could tighten more dramatically between the middle edits.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through intensifying gestures: signing to tide → faster signing → stepping into water → submersion. The dominant stake (translating silence) deepens when "water rose, translating his body into a bass note." Cost manifests physically through cold water and emotionally through the "memory of applause."

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: phoenixes → murals → corridors → mirror chamber → key discovery, each deepening the arsonist's commitment. The cost escalates from artistic labor to complete self-sacrifice, with "one throb per story" crystallizing the price.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Elara's drumming intensifies from tentative tapping to full percussion performance, with the lagoon's brightening response raising stakes. The cost manifests in her acceptance of future treatments while maintaining "quiet rebellion," though the immediate dramatic tension could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal theory-testing to navigating an impossible space where footfalls create starlight paths. The whisper challenge ("Will you match my stride?") forces Mara to adjust her gait, with the coin's temperature providing immediate feedback. The final test at the microphone crystallizes the choice with port-wide consequences.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes accumulate through layered pressures: the cosmic (darkness swallowing constellations), the immediate (the drowned child), and the personal (the guardian's silent vow). The escalation through ritual intensification—from individual light fragments to braided patterns to the hovering pearl—creates meaningful deepening that narrows options to this single moment of recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—planting "forests of second thoughts" through quiet rebellion—escalates from personal chess teaching to town-wide synchronized displays. The magnetic grotto's pull creates coherent pressure that deepens from whisper to physical force to community alignment. Visible costs appear in the townspeople's transformative realizations (accountant stepping back, teenager forgiving, veteran weeping), though Mara herself faces minimal personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal suppression ("hiding her strength behind grace because grace was safer") through the island's ultimatum to the final choice between "authenticity over amnesty." The sunrise deadline creates genuine pressure. Agency drives the resolution through Lira's dance that solidifies the island. Minor issue: the ex-pirates' arrival feels slightly convenient though it doesn't resolve the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on smuggling grief in a world where "joy became law and sorrow contraband." The performer's ritualistic whittling and narration deepens pressure through accumulation. The farmer's progression from folded arms to taking the stem to accepting the heart shows escalating engagement with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from breaking a ban to dissolving identity itself, with the tremor steadying into song marking genuine transformation. The poet's agency drives each boundary crossing, from touching pillar to speaking aloud to walking on water. Cost becomes visible when she loses physical form to become "columns of light that rose and scattered."

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from initial glass arrangement through plant awakening to final artistic transformation, with clear cost in trading awakenings for perception. The pressure tightens when ivy creates "a living frame" that forces Lira to confront her perceptual difference, though middle beats could sharpen the trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as each opened jar adds to the resonant field, culminating in the choice to remain as keeper. The progression from questioning assumptions to releasing all sounds shows clear escalation, though the cost of staying could be more viscerally felt beyond the conceptual level.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates through the maker's nightly rituals (polishing, cataloguing, folding) until the caretaker's single utterance triggers escalation: she pricks the cereus into the sky, which cascades into garden manifestation and daughter apparition. The dominant stake—whether withering can be taught to bloom—faces its test when she must choose between keeping the locket or planting it. Cost is visible: years pass, the caretaker winds down, but she continues teaching others through "subdued ardor."

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation as Mara's mapping reveals not loss but "relocation" of value, with the dominant stake being cultural comprehension after collapse. The tension between measuring/containing versus accepting fluidity creates pressure. Cost is visible in leaving the cards as "compass" for others while carrying only "measured darkness"—though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of recovering suppressed truth escalates through the archive's collapsing architecture and the memory core's revelation. The historian's agency drives the resolution through her song that cracks the core. Cost is visible in the pagoda's destruction and the "thousand small betrayals" revealed, though the middle section could tighten the pressure between discovery and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: shadow spreading, library transforming, stakes crystallizing when Lira realizes "the building had begun to metamorphose." The tightening occurs when she must choose between recording and resisting. Cost is visible in the binding ritual and ongoing vigilance required.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering from betrayal while maintaining compassion—escalates through the reconstruction process that forces Mara to shed protective layers. The tightening occurs when she must "balance self-respect and compassion" by reporting the crime while protecting the chameleons, with visible cost in accepting she cannot save all the lost ones.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from physical wound to emotional revelation about the brother's death through the coffee ring reading. The dominant stake—releasing the trapped moment—tightens as Mara reopens her scar, paying visible cost in blood. Agency manifests through deliberate self-wounding to complete the interrupted transfer. Minor deduction for the relatively smooth resolution without more friction.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—deepens through Mara's discovery that love exists "in the interval between frames, the darkness the audience never noticed." The psychometry reading escalates from passive observation to active transformation when she aims the quartz to release Lin's silhouette. Cost is visible but could be sharper in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes center on freeing trapped creativity with escalation through the aurora's intensification and the protagonist's ritual actions. The cost manifests in accepting uncertainty rather than forcing art. One meaningful deepening occurs when she aims the sextant at herself, though the middle section meanders slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: archive escapes → guard follows → confrontation in folded corridors → spark exchange → clock transformation → forest planting → burning that pollinates. The guard's agency drives each turn, from pressing the spark into the clock to tending saplings "occasionally everywhere at once." Cost manifests in his dissolution into probability ("presence smeared across probability").

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as she moves deeper into stranger territories—from piston-driven kapoks to clockwork banyans to USB-port mahogany—with each step requiring greater surrender. The dominant stake (rediscovering mental frontier) tightens when she must literally unravel her identity, paying visible prices at each stage.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on accessing "unused courage" after escape from constraint. The spiral journey inward creates accumulative pressure, though the transformation moment itself lacks resistance - the stone simply warms when touched. Cost appears in leaving the guides behind, but agency feels slightly passive.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from routine duty through discovered anomaly (bolt) to existential choice between safety/forgetting. The fortress's revelation that it "devoured memory of danger" reframes all prior details and forces the binary decision. Cost is legible in the fortress's destruction and the bellhop's acceptance of remembered screams.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: centuries of research → finding the fresh crown mark → activating the rune → reality unraveling → books correcting themselves. The pretender's own marginalia becoming evidence creates earned reversal with clear cost. Slightly mechanical in the middle transition between discovery and activation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering why shipping lanes vanish—escalates through Mara's increasing risk-taking from passive listening to active descent into the ocean chamber. The story's single major tightening occurs when she commits to following the mysterious coordinates, assembling the raft despite "windless night." Cost is visible in her physical descent and the revelation that witnessing requires literal submersion, though the resolution's mystical ease slightly reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in the stalled rebellion—escalates through the stone circle's rising hum and the protagonist's physical journey from passive observation to active participation. The cost manifests in her acceptance of a humbler role than stargazing pilot. One more beat of resistance before acceptance would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: whispers→kite message→finding embryo→proposing new tradition→elder resistance→actual unsealing. The youngest mason's support provides the tipping point. Cost is legible (abandoning sealed certainty for annual negotiation), though the opposition could be more forceful.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.0)
    Escalation operates through accumulative density as Mira moves from avoidance to speaking aloud to leaving the photograph, each step deepening engagement with grief. The cost registers in the act of planting memory "like a seed," though pressure could tighten more decisively in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates from external (narrowing corridors) to internal (fragmented self-portraits) to existential ("the mind must descend into necessary darkness or be pressed into paper itself"). Lira's agency drives the resolution through her choice to redesign reality via the tarot circle and painted door, with visible cost in accepting the "luminescent ache."

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from investigating disappearances to understanding temporal manipulation to actively rescuing the trapped researchers. Alba's serene anger enables her unique agency—she can perceive and navigate where others succumbed to terror. The cost manifests in the researchers' "eternal terror" and the effort required to "bring the others back."

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes clear from opening: accessing forbidden truth versus safety. The crimson trigger discovery tightens options effectively. However, the middle section where she decides to release the information feels slightly underdeveloped—the internal struggle could show more resistance before capitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal safety to ideological transmission as scavengers circle and breach the dome. The boy's arrival forces Lila's decisive choice between violence and her pacifist methods. Cost appears in the cracking dome and the risk of offering peace to potential threat, though the immediate consequence could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: constellations sleepwalking → garden responding → spike vibrating → goddess arriving as "pressure, a tide of hush." The cost is unmistakable when Lira must "surrender her coolness, the very attribute that let her read water and weather," though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from the journalist's urgent question through Octavia's discovery of the satellite to its destruction, with meaningful deepening when she realizes smaller fragments remain. The mathematical proof as intervention shows agency under constraint. Cost is visible in emotional moments but could be more visceral—the "orbit of shame" remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (silencing the baby's cry) intensifies through discovery of letters, coordinates, amber, and the haunted firmware, each narrowing options toward the binding ritual. The cost is visceral—tattooing her own throat while "each prick syncing the baby's cry to the rhythm trapped in resin." The escalation follows the accumulative lens coherently, though could push harder on the physical difficulty of self-tattooing.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density—from trembling unlearning to chalk drawing to tile flake communion to memory dissolution. The dominant stake of finding meaning intensifies as the artist accepts erasure as "permission," though the pressure could tighten more sharply in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal grief to collective healing through the act of reconstruction. The tessera placement escalates from individual gesture to shared ritual with the plaza's final "exhalation." Cost is visible in their "fire-forgiven hands" working through night. Minor deduction for relatively gentle pressure that could push harder.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from the coin's warning to the hoop scattering years, to the tree drinking metal, culminating in the ghost's dissolution dance. The stakes intensify as "the fractured timeline holding her here is collapsing," though the resolution through dance feels slightly convenient despite its poetic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from testing a rumor to discovering systemic suppression ("scarcity, keeping the pathways dim"). The somatic markers (mother's hands, swallowed laughter) create accumulative pressure that forces Mara to choose between skepticism and following the bodily compass. Cost manifests as surrendering her protective skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: fossil lifts and floats → cave fork forces directional choice → walls narrow to "throat of stone" → sleeper's dream reaches out first, reversing Lira's agency. The dominant stake (becoming voice of the unknown) deepens when Lira must surrender her recording role to enable transmission. Cost is visible when she steps back with "recorder silent" and accepts her redefinition. Slight deduction for the sleeper's actions remaining somewhat ethereal rather than fully embodied threat/pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation occurs through accumulative density as each button adds to the prophecy's clarity, culminating in the spindle of possibility. The midnight deadline creates temporal pressure. The cost manifests through the warehouse's transformation and the turner's acceptance of her role's burden—though the stakes remain somewhat abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on whether trust can be rebuilt after betrayal, escalating through the coded trail that tests his commitment to follow despite uncertainty. The progression from passive carrying of the pillbox to active code-following to the vulnerable rooftop meeting shows deepening agency. Cost appears in accepting that healing requires "tracing the scar" rather than erasure, though the resolution's symmetry ("Unused courage rose between them") slightly softens the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes intensify through accumulation: the ticking gutters create time pressure, the woman's needle-work with fog deepens mystery, and the revelation about the daughter raises emotional cost. The coachman's choice to offer his memory demonstrates agency under the accumulative lens, though the precise consequences of accepting the needle could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Kiran moves deeper into the oasis, with each choice between timelines carrying increasing weight. The lantern's response—brightening for blooming, dimming for char—creates tangible stakes. The cost becomes explicit when "Cracks widened, but instead of shattering, the glass unfolded," showing transformation requires accepting fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate from pruning a dying rose to actively reviving it through inherited knowledge. The "quivering hush" deepens twice—first when the tooth touches the stem, then when "even gulls on the pier dared not cry." Cost manifests in Mira's "protected vulnerability" and physical exhaustion, with the final image of "a small, defiant lantern" showing transformed agency.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—deepens through the stone circle sequence where Mira must "let the crack widen until it became a door." The pressure tightens as she chooses between remaining translucent like the whales or descending to teach their songs, with visible cost in leaving her known world, though the internal conflict could use more dramatized friction.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—releasing held secrets to find connection—is signaled early through the twig. However, escalation remains flat: Arin decides to return secrets, meets Elian, gives him the twig, watches words spiral up. No meaningful resistance or complication tightens the pressure. The revelation of glowing filaments connecting everyone feels unearned without prior struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate causally: initial subsonic manipulation → Lyra's counter-signal success → trickster counter-counter-song ("colder and sharper") → final mirror solution. The dominant stake (preventing community self-destruction) tightens when the tricksters respond "so soon, so elegant," forcing Lyra's desperate phase-shift calculation. Visible cost appears as crowds shift from rage to curiosity, paying the price of manipulation.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through spatial constriction (corridors narrowing until "shoulders brushed both walls") to the organ's reality-warping reverberation, culminating in the choice between keeping her mother's ghost or completing the quest. The cost is legible when her mother "smiled, fading as the organ's last reverberation dissolved into silence."

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Elias paints "negative space around three faces," culminating in the woman's arrival with the matching ribbon fragment. The reunification creates visible cost through tears and dissolution. Stakes deepen when the painted eye triggers the search dogs' convergence, though the truncated ending slightly weakens the final pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the three stanzas, each deepening Lila's commitment until the exchange demand forces a genuine trade-off. The reversal from rescue to substitution creates meaningful pressure with visible cost. The jet stream's attempted reassertion adds external urgency to the internal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening: glass fragment vibrates → projects life-frames → forms staircase → fuses into bridge. The dominant stake (transforming "never" into possibility) tightens when the fiddler must choose between remaining at the pullout or entering the pixelated lattice. Cost becomes legible when the hitchhiker fades and she stands alone, though agency sometimes feels more responsive than driven.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - whether to stay with the train or leave before demolition - tightens when Mara reveals the imminent razing. Leo's choice to burn the money rather than flee shows agency with visible cost. The escalation under accumulative lens works through density increase, though the drone confusion resolution edges toward convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal decoding to shared healing, with the temple demanding payment as meaningful cost. The progression from isolated chronicling to witnessed burden-sharing creates genuine pressure, though the transformation happens somewhat smoothly without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from external magical failure to internal confession, with the plant demanding blood as concrete cost. The dominant stake of confronting hidden truth lands, though the conjurer's resurrection deflates earned consequence by reversing the price of her earlier choice.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: from following scarred summons to planting the clipping to sacrificing personal memories. The cost is visceral—"feeling the burn travel through marrow"—and each surrendered memory (childhood visions, blueprints, lost lover) carries specific weight. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as density increases toward the climactic memory-sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal debt ("holes in the soul") through the bartering ritual to accepting transformation ("part root, part memory"). The cost is visible as "the tree drank another tomorrow she would never live," though the middle dialogue with Ardan could apply more immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—what to do with silence after loss—escalates through accumulative pressure as Elliot moves from handling the cloth to understanding why he kept it to deciding to give it away. Cost is visible in releasing his last physical connection. The story's single deepening turn (understanding to action) fits the 600-800 word scope appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as density increase and pattern deepening—from physical climbing to linguistic mapping to seed-planting to root-wrapping permission. The cost is legible in her transformed relationship to knowledge and the permanent scar. One meaningful deepening achieved when the root asks permission rather than pulling her across.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation as each smelted story-bead adds to the gear in her chest, with the rising tide creating time pressure that forces faster work. The cost manifests in the physical transformation and the permanent carrying of the furnace within.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation: personal confession→pearl brightening→collective connection→world transformation. Each confession deepens the cost ("I believed survival required forgetting how to love"). The dominant stake—isolation versus connection—tightens as walls literally dissolve, though the universal scale slightly diffuses personal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: medication withdrawal → map discovery → graffiti wisdom → accordion playing → name speaking → final renunciation. Each revelation deepens the stakes around self-forgiveness. The cost accumulates through patched bellows, torn map, and ultimately leaving the accordion behind.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: backward-ticking watch stirring mist, lullaby returning as harmony, signature detaching to enable access. The dominant stake—accessing versus releasing unspoken words—tightens when she must trade her belief-moment, with visible cost as the library dissolves.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes crystallize through temporal pressure ("envoys would arrive at dawn") and the weighing metaphor that structures choice. The escalation follows accumulative logic—coffee reading to plant telepathy to violin harmonics to final transformation. The empire's drums approaching while Lira hears "the slower drum of photosynthesis" creates effective counter-pressure, though the truncated ending slightly dulls the final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from preserving one spark to risking all collected sparks, with the threshold demanding total surrender as its price. The mortician's agency drives the escalation through her choice to "infuse that spark into the threshold" despite understanding the cost. The tightening occurs when she realizes crossing means "surrendering every spark" yet turning back means "oblivion claim them anyway," forcing the decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal forgiveness to grove salvation through Lira's climb and discovery. The sister's arrival creates genuine pressure requiring response. Cost is visible in "the gentle weight of responsibility accepted again and again," though the resolution feels slightly too neat with immediate reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on the smugglers' fate and medicine for the quarantined village, with pressure building through Lira's growing acceptance of ambiguity. The compromise solution shows agency, though escalation could tighten further—the smugglers' immediate compliance feels too easy given the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes build through temporal accumulation—each ring representing years of deliberate forgetting, with the "outermost, thin and bright" marking complete disappearance. The withheld revelation creates sustained tension, though pressure relies more on conceptual weight than active conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: dust settling deeper, pulse quickening, towers beginning to sing, culminating in the protagonist's transformation. The cost—becoming immobile stone—is legible throughout via the towers' example, though the piece relies more on textural deepening than causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating impossibilities—bare feet on ice, walking on mist, the keystone floating free—each deepening Elian's surrender to the method. The cost manifests as his failures rise "like startled birds" and dissolve, though the pressure could tighten more sharply toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each sound-color brings Miren closer to but not quite matching the chord from the night of drowning. The constraint of "before the last lantern burned out" creates temporal pressure. Cost becomes visible when she releases the key tag and transforms from solitary seeker to community witness, though middle development could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from witnessing to active alignment as the coins' chord shifts from static to Mira's own voice saying "You did align," confirming her agency paradox. The pressure coheres through accumulative revelations that narrow her path to dissolution, with visible cost in her final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each crystallized name adds weight, narrowing from general sacrifice to specific losses. The cost manifests physically as names sink "cold and bright as starlight" into his chest cavity. The transformation from fear to love ("sea beasts had never been beasts at all") creates meaningful reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the bell's widening crack responding to doubt, forcing Calen to confront his original choice. The cosmic reversal creates genuine urgency with visible consequences (fish leaping upward, rivers emptying skyward). The resolution earned through specific cost (blood, hair, naming). Minor deduction as the middle section's pacing occasionally stalls during technical descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from private guilt to public revelation as Lila moves from ridge to town square. The dominant stake—whether to break twenty years of silence—tightens through the mirror scene where past and present converge, with clear cost in her father's death.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the alchemist's progression from observation to action to dissolution, with clear cost at each stage. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as patterns intensify (starlings, crystal growth, flame). The transformation's inevitability ("as it had claimed every seeker") slightly reduces agency, though her conscious choice to proceed maintains tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: from the cracked buckle to the memory of the lost rookie to Zev's revision of the entire release sequence. The dominant stake—preserving trust through vigilance—tightens as we understand the cost of failure ("drop another flyer into the void"), with agency shown through Zev's choice to revise rather than simply repair.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on defeating mutual numbness through custody of consciousness, with one meaningful deepening when both realize "the numbness was mutual." The practice blade "honed to cut arguments rather than flesh" provides textural pressure rather than reversal. Cost becomes visible when tears and laughter return, though escalation remains gentle rather than intensifying—appropriate for the Accumulative lens but lacking the tightening that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: seed's mysterious arrival → underground rippling → dream infiltration → flower eruption → cavern descent → final surrender. Each stage deepens Mara's confrontation with control versus evolution. The cost manifests concretely when she dissolves her master key, foreclosing return to certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (restoring laughter to the grief-stricken house) escalates through Elara's ritual movements, with visible struggle in the engine's resistance and her whispered "I'm listening." The cost is felt in her first real smile "since the hourglass had been turned over years ago," though the mechanism of transformation remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from boundary protection to existential choice about certainty itself, with the pendant's oscillation ("lighthouse unsure whether to warn or welcome") marking rising pressure. The guardian's agency drives the transformation through accepting the echo-key and darkening the pendant. Cost is visible in the library remaining "one degree closer" but still dimensionally separated—a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through failed approximations building to the realization that "creative destruction demanded more than ingredients." The pivot—cutting his palm for blood covenant—marks genuine cost and agency. Each ritual addition deepens pressure until the crozier transforms, though middle attempts could show sharper consequence between failures.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density as Kael climbs, tunes, and merges the fragments, with each discarded assumption raising the emotional stakes. The cost is unmistakable when his mother's voice transforms from "static death rattle" to first "hello." One meaningful deepening that reweights his understanding of endings/beginnings.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation through accumulative density as timeline-merging intensifies from initial ferry slip through radio work to final acceptance of guardian role. Cost is legible in Cass's isolation ("Cass alone remembered") and permanent duty. The stakes deepen effectively though could use one more visceral pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density as Mara's weavings intensify from stitching melodies to creating neural nets, with the gallery's responsive hunger forcing her final surrender. The cost crystallizes when "she began to weave herself into the unsettling calm, sinew threading through her own veins."

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief through forbidden study to the dive beyond "the known grid," with each step foreclosing return to her old life. The anchor link's transformation from grief-weight to "sextant" shows agency-driven progression. Cost accumulates through isolation, transgression, and the final acceptance that mourning and love exist in transformed balance.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from individual encounter to collective need as more spirits gather, each with urgent unfinished business. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens through density increase. Cost is visible in Mara's growing burden, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth for the weight established.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as Mara moves deeper into the facility, with each discovery (gold fleck→cables→trapped researchers→restored connections) intensifying the dominant stake. The "crashing hush" pattern creates rhythmic tension. Cost is visible in her physical transformation and commitment to return "with each tide."

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the heartbeat countdown creating urgency, with the dominant stake being identity resolution. The protagonist's agency drives the defragmentation through deliberate actions (tracing patterns costs heartbeats). One meaningful deepening occurs as understanding shifts from deletion to rearrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each translated word costs the storyteller physically (copper veins cooling/hardening) while the language's death approaches with sunset. The dominant stake—preserving meaning through translation—tightens when reduced to "a single bird" tracing the final sentence. Cost is legible in the permanent transformation of her body and loss of "ancestral resonance."

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation works through textural intensification: static voices → phone melting → gravity defying → full metamorphosis. Vale's agency drives the key moment when she presses the arrowhead to the phone's "molten heart," triggering transformation. The cost is unmistakable as she becomes "both researcher and cryptid," losing human form to join the changed.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation - statues converge, stack into tower, bridge threatens collapse - all building pressure that forces the decisive musical release. The dominant stake (breaking the petrification spell) tightens through visible cost (teacher's disappearance, shell sacrifice). Agency manifests through the choice to channel fear into music despite imminent danger.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through textural deepening: from the storm's "impatience to be free" through Lila's traced letters to the final synchronization of "storm and soldier, both learning the same rhythm of return." The dominant stake—reconnecting separated families—tightens when Six accepts both delivery and return, with cost visible in the "three birthdays ago" absence.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: fragment to shards to full circle, silence to song to world-teaching. The dominant stake—transforming silence into possibility—deepens as each car awakens. Cost is visible in "the younger him, fists jammed in pockets, unable to give voice" paid through current transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes emerge through library's geometric transformation creating pressure that Mireille must navigate, with escalation via the scarf's increasing tension leading to the copper book discovery. The cost lands clearly (library permanently altered, new responsibility accepted). One meaningful deepening sufficient at this length, though the conflict could use slightly more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: dry wells flooding with light, fog thickening to flesh, the librarian trading shadow for spectrum.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure: from sensing the trapped melody to threading memory through "the keyhole of nowhere" to the final release. The dominant stake—freeing the imprisoned melody—tightens through each ritual step. Cost manifests in Aelira's years of absence and the world's dimmed state without her music.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on recovering stolen decade of memories, with escalation through discovering the mushroom as ledger, then choosing to leave payment rather than take everything back. The dominant stake (memory recovery) tightens when Elara realizes she traded them herself. Cost is legible but the middle section could use sharper pressure between discovery and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the accumulative ritual: glass alignment, tea-leaf annotation, shadow transformation, and the ultimatum "Drink, and the exile reverses; refuse, and we both remain ghosts." The dominant stake—reversing exile through mentorship—tightens as each ritual step narrows options, though the middle section could apply more pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation as Arin's weaving demands increasing toll—threads from marrow, silvering hands, thinning breath. The cost is legible and builds under the textural lens. One meaningful deepening occurs as personal sacrifice becomes world-preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation—each knot releases more silence, making the sanctuary's hush "deepen" and walls "vibrate," building to the collective release of all spirits.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: matching tears lead to film comparison, shadow evolution reveals deliberate erasure, the wall responds by drawing the missing henge. The cost crystallizes in accepting that "every blank on parchment was a wound," though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes crystallize around decoding Earhart's transmission to understand surrender, with pressure building through the recording analysis sequence and snow globe manipulation. The deepening occurs when "letting go is the equal and opposite reaction to holding on" reframes the entire investigation. Cost manifests in leaving the globe below and returning empty-handed, though escalation could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accumulates through the storm's temporal constraint and the ghost's increasing manifestation, forcing Lira to act "before the moment closes." The cost is visible when she dissolves into music and walks alone afterward, fundamentally altered. The escalation from encoding to painting to singing shows clear intensification under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—returning joy to the captain before the fleet arrives—escalates through the elevator's rise and diary decryption. The ticking clock ("fleet arrived at dusk") and vertical progression create coherent pressure, though the captain's transformation happens somewhat quickly given the setup's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The broken tether creates coherent pressure forcing Mira to confront her mentor's teachings about emotional cloud signatures. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes herself in the cumulus—this discovery narrows her options to either dismiss or embrace this new understanding. Cost is visible in her career pivot, though middle escalation could tighten further between recognition and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation operates through accumulative pressure as demolition approaches—floodlights probe windows, hydraulic claws bite bark, beams crash through roof. The dominant stake (preserving knowledge before destruction) tightens through Lira's racing heart against her steady hand, with visible cost in the building's collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure builds through pattern accumulation: phrasebook discovery → hopscotch connection → lens revelation → coordinate plotting against captain's orders. The escalation from passive curiosity to active defiance ("signing her name beneath with the flourish") shows meaningful tightening with professional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from searching for prophecy scraps to confronting the broken world ("continents stuttering, oceans skipping tides") to the final sacrifice of self-integration. The rhythm of repair (tick, pause, mend, release) provides clear escalation structure with visible cost when she "felt the brass key at her throat fuse to her skin."

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (saving the planet before arches collapse) escalates through accumulating pressure: ghost's limitations → Kiran finds bell → others emerge → collective weaving under time pressure. The seven-dawn timeline creates urgency with visible cost when Luma sacrifices her ghostly form. Stakes deepen rather than reverse, fitting the Accumulative lens well.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes center on the world's final moments and the protagonist's role in soothing rather than preventing the end. The deepening occurs through accumulation—from adjusting time to save lives, to seeing the cost of those adjustments, to choosing to become the lullaby itself. Cost is legible in the trade-offs shown through the mirrors and the dissolution of self into function.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—saving the hikers before frost seals everything—creates clear time pressure that forces Nadia's action. Escalation occurs through the nut's oil creating the bridge, birds growing frenzied, and the final cost of leaving permanent impressions after maintaining distance. The resolution is earned through Nadia's agency in using the nut and accepting the price of departure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (transforming guilt into useful action) deepens through the ritual with the chrysalis, though escalation under the accumulative lens relies more on pattern accumulation than dramatic tightening. The cost is legible in her choice between fire extinguisher and child, and the ongoing volunteer work.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: counting fifteen absences opens the keyhole, twenty-three shifts the library, lanterns fuse to return the bottle. The dominant stake—finding where stories begin—tightens when the vendor must "forgive the beginning." Cost manifests when serving the apprentice requires stepping back, heart unlatched, accepting the listener role.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through deepening engagement with memory—from tasting rain to full subsumption to crystallization. The cost accumulates in Lira's body ("threatening to drown her") and the lord's decades of grief. One meaningful deepening executed with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake—breaking isolation between structures—is signaled early through "silos still speak only outward; never across." The story achieves one meaningful deepening as languages proliferate and silos connect. Yet agency remains soft; Sora encounters no resistance, and her interventions succeed without visible struggle or trade-offs that would create genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from holding the mirror, to pressing it against temple, to synaptic modification, to full integration. The dominant stake - recovering abandoned dreams - tightens as the engineer discovers her grandmother's consciousness transfer research wasn't failure but "seed corn." Cost is visible in permanent neural alteration and the irreversible nature of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (finding and planting seeds of vigilance) drives consistent pressure through the hour's time limit. The gravity inversion creates urgency and the threshold effects force committed choices. Cost accumulates through physical discomfort and the weight of responsibility, though the middle section could tighten its pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—restoring song to the silent grove—escalates through accumulating musical discoveries, from single notes to chord progressions to the final chorus. Cost is legible in the sculptor's physical absorption of the grove's grief ("throat aches with borrowed sorrow"). The hedgehog's trust progression provides external pressure. Stakes deepen when she realizes she must enter the fracture rather than observe it.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal exile to understanding failure's necessity—"the prince had needed to fail spectacularly to learn humility." The keeper's appearance with the matching knight piece creates meaningful pressure that forces Kael's realization. Cost is visible in three years of exile and the transformation required to return "not as a tutor of princes, but as a translator of silences."

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—opening the clasp without violence to understand her buried moment of near-violence—creates coherent pressure through the accumulative cataloging of silences. The escalation through increasingly intimate silences ("hush after shouted apology" to "silence of restraint") deepens meaningfully. However, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off; the cost of "locking open forever" could be more tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: seven nights of returning, adding "distilled serenity," unfolding and refolding layers "thick as stories." The dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—deepens when "the tide's thought reversed" and the seed splits, with visible cost in the communal quieting and Ari's transformed understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure—from data gathering to echo detection to the vortex navigation under time constraint. The gravity return creates genuine urgency.

One meaningful deepening occurs when the marble "softened beneath her touch," forcing irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through the accumulation of arranged markers, each pointing to a specific failure, culminating in the spiral that triggers the flute's transformation. The cost is visible in the dissolved guardianship and the acceptance of living "in the tear between worlds."

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—whether emotion can be measured and transposed—escalates through the halo's increasing agency (orbiting her wrist), the press printing unbidden, and emotions leaking uncontrolled. The reversal decision carries weight as she sacrifices her controlled experiment for authentic uncertainty. Cost registers through the workshop's dissolution though the emotional mechanics occasionally feel conceptual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: each encounter extends from "short seconds" to "minutes dense as amber," building pressure toward Mira's final choice. The cost is legible—accepting perpetual invitation means releasing her need for mentor approval. The pendant's sympathetic vibration creates coherent pressure throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: from proving a hypothesis to confronting personal grief to accepting reciprocal vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (preserving memory) to communal (saving the orchards), with Elowen's choice forcing visible trade-offs. The tension peaks when "the silk drank the memory, color draining from its weave," though the brother's voice returning somewhat deflates the established cost of memory loss.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: first the bay folds, then parallel Liras appear, then the pilot's death reveals itself, culminating in Lira's choice to break the cycle. The cost is legible when she "knelt on the oil-stained deck and pressed the glass into a crack," though middle beats could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from lamp repair to spiritual guardianship through the widow's increasing presence and demands ("the balm must be sealed inside something living"). The protagonist's agency drives the resolution—choosing to bottle the ache and continue the letter chain. Cost is visible in accepting supernatural duty, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural intensification: from routine trimming to prophetic fracture to steering storms to final transformation. The cost is legible as Kael releases physical form ("the lighthouse crumbled behind him"), though middle beats could tighten the pressure more explicitly.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding story magnetism—escalates through the wing's revelations about Lira's life, forcing Kael to choose between observation and participation. The cost manifests in the wing crumbling, exhausted, and Kael's transformation from watchful to permeable. Pressure coheres through accumulating color-memories that demand increasing engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding how to properly mourn through "quantified sorrow"—deepens as Elara moves from finding the broken sextant to actively mapping the astronomer's memories and witnessing the brass heal. The escalation from discovery to transformation is present, though the pressure could tighten more decisively through active opposition rather than contemplative progression.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: night "pushes back, hungry, unraveling her song faster than she could weave it," forcing deeper sacrifice (kneeling, whispering the peach memory, climbing higher). The final stakes crystallize when she must release her own memories to save the realm. Cost is legible but could be more viscerally dramatized at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: the invitation's paradox, the mirrored books showing her younger self, the candles' countdown, culminating in her choice to inhabit "the wrong address." The cost is visible in recognizing she "gave away pieces she could not spare" and the foreclosed path of following her habitual escape route.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from noticing disappearances to active defiance through planting, with the dominant stake of preserving memory versus accepting loss. The bread-sharing and seed-planting deepen pressure effectively. Cost is visible in "throat tight" and the negotiation with forgetting, though middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Escalation builds through density increase as Elara moves from measuring anonymous vows to discovering her own, forcing the choice between preservation and release. The cost is visible (library and self dissolving) but the middle lacks active pressure - mostly observation until the recognition moment.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (father's freedom vs. preserving trust) escalates through accumulating pressure - each "false start" and near-break of the truce tightens options. Roe's revelation of the father's photograph transforms the stakes from abstract to visceral, though the story could benefit from one more beat showing the immediate cost of Lila's choice.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing Mara's internal storm from flooding the valley—escalates through the forest's vote forcing immediate convergence. Cost is visible in the ring's dissolution and weather redistribution, though agency feels slightly passive until the final convergence act.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with abandoned artistry—escalates through discovered objects that force increasingly costly confrontations with her past. The progression from finding the lock to uncorking her mother's pigment to painting "everyone she ever loved and failed" shows meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in the transformation of "regret...transmuted into pigment," though the lack of external opposition slightly limits tension.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal quest to systemic healing as Lysandra discovers truth's physical effect on the greenhouse environment. The escalation through map discovery, archive exploration, and vapor collection maintains coherent pressure. Cost manifests in the plants' visible responses to honesty/dishonesty throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through the sculpture's increasing boldness ("motion grew bolder, arms sweeping wide") as the ice releases deeper layers of blue. The tension between preservation and entropy drives the piece, with meaningful cost in the fragment's sacrifice. The final acknowledgment that "preservation is a duet between maker and made" crystallizes the earned understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through calculated fire trajectories ("forty-three minutes...sixty") forcing Lumen's choice between evacuation and resolution, with the internal static demanding "containment, not flight." The controlled burn he creates inside mirrors and neutralizes the external wildfire, showing agency that transforms threat into rebirth with clear cost.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from hearing the rattle to feeling vibration to discovering the locket to the public reading. The sandstorm's curfew sirens create external pressure at the crucial moment. Cost is legible in the collective tears and twenty years of suppressed grief, though agency could be stronger at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: dance-cipher performance, spider's crossing at the fourth minute, dice roll revealing "I REMEMBER," then the climactic safe opening. The cost manifests in the jammed lock and the deliberate leaving of misleading evidence. Could strengthen with more visible struggle during the dance sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through density increase as gravity anomalies intensify from pier to chamber to vault, forcing Mara's physical and emotional descent. The cost is visible when she tastes the memory. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preventing prophetic catastrophe—escalates from external struggle against rippling glyphs to internal recognition that "hush is not absence but presence refined." The prophecy's resistance ("tightening its ripples into sharper glyphs") creates genuine pressure. However, the resolution's ease once she shifts methods undercuts the accumulated tension, and the cost of her choice remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen from curiosity about dead mail to learning architectural language to accepting spectral inheritance. The widow's lessons create escalating pressure through seal-pressing, wall-listening, and final branding that forces the narrator's choice to join the conversation, with visible cost in accepting this haunted role.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the garden's impending dissolution at dawn, with Mara's quickening heartbeat intensifying the transfer. The cost is visible in the garden's collapse and the shell's final silence, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to forgive herself by undoing her forgeries—intensifies through the ritual of unlinking, with visible cost in the blood offering and the dissolution of seventeen years of false identity. The escalation follows an accumulative pattern of increasing symbolic weight rather than external obstacles, appropriate to the lens but lacking a sharp reversal or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: solo singing becomes multiplied echoes, then harmonic dialogue with the stranger, culminating in the choice between silence and preservation. The dominant stake—understanding why people echo—deepens when she discovers "to echo is to be chosen by the universe's grief." Cost materializes when she accepts eternal resonance, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure coheres through accumulating revelations: dream cameos spelling "N-A-D-I-A," relics blooming from the globe, the radioman's ghost chain. The dominant stake (salvaging pure memory from wreckage) tightens when Nadia must choose what to preserve, though the resolution relies more on ritual completion than active choice under opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—validating hidden maintenance work—deepens through the firefly constellation matching the morning's net repair and the guard's recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to expose genocidal truth or protect the living—is signaled early and tightens when Lina discovers her father's betrayal. Escalation occurs through accumulation: courier's death → Apple discovery → letter reassembly → father's complicity → final choice. The cost is legible when she walks away "with empty pockets yet carrying a sharper gaze," having foreclosed the path of immediate revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal vigil to collective awakening as the congregation forms and participates in the final revelation. The seven lightning strikes and shadow-silhouette emergence provide the meaningful deepening. However, Cassia's agency diminishes after the congregation arrives—she becomes more vessel than active agent in the final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving ephemeral beauty against inevitable erasure—deepens through accumulation as each jar fills with increasingly personal sounds, from gull cry to his own sob. The tightening occurs when uncorking releases transform individual sounds into collective voice, forcing the poet to sacrifice his collection. Cost is legible in the emptied jars and lighter satchel, though agency could be stronger in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from the artifact's dangerous grief through the ritual's progression to final transformation, with Lira's agency driving each step. The threat that "every throat would drown in salt memory" establishes clear cost, though the middle section could tighten the pressure more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: compass spinning wild, ice groaning, cracks spidering in "deliberate geometry." The dominant stake (town's survival choice) tightens when Elara promises "Tomorrow night, the ice will speak." Cost manifests in the elders stepping back in fear before understanding arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.7)
    Escalation builds through accumulating discoveries that narrow Maya's options: lantern reveals compass rose → burn patterns match father's scars → journal exposes truth → forced choice between Kellerman's method and honoring resistance. The cost crystallizes when she abandons her mentor's "controlling influence" to file a new kind of report.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from refused apology to active repair to tentative forgiveness. The cost is visible in Rowan's trembling hands, Elias's initial flatness, and the finite nature of the clockwork heart. One meaningful tightening occurs when Rowan presents the completed heart.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: kaleidoscope decoding intensifies to flight conducting to bell-casting urgency as the workshop's anchor dissolves. The dominant stake (hearing/creating the unheard bell) tightens when "Time...suddenly snapped taut." Cost manifests in Orrin's burns and the arrow's sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure: 117 patterns → Leo's voice → evidence locker → video revelation → decommission deadline. The dominant stake (finding truth about the vanished crew) tightens when Mara discovers "the corporation had deleted the crew to protect the algorithm." Cost appears in her choice to abandon her role, though the corporate opposition remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation as each mirror reveals another perspective (wounded child, guilty captain, debating elders), tightening pressure until Mara must act. The stakes crystallize around preventing mutual destruction, with visible cost as the fragment dulls and loses its prophetic power, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly after the mirror sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen effectively from personal death-seeking to understanding endings as "chord progression, patient and repeating," with the storm sequence providing meaningful pressure. The transformation is earned through accumulated imagery rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens, though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative deepening as he moves from passive memory to active ritual (burning the remaining letter, pressing ash to soil), with the dominant stake of understanding-versus-possession narrowing to acceptance of necessary absence. The cost is legible in his admission that understanding feels "incomplete without her witness" yet he chooses to tend the gap.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief (tears on gauze) through ritual attempt (drawing the diagonal line) to successful communal preservation (twelve shards distributed). The walker's agency drives the transformation through her diagonal stepping ability and gloved hand gesture. Cost is visible in the surrender of control and the shift from individual mourning to collective stewardship, with the final image of perpetual revision showing ongoing price.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes accumulate through textural deepening as each photograph adds to the pattern, with the trumpet man's arrival creating the key intensification—his participation validates the collective ritual. The spiral formation and subsequent transformation of photographs ("edges curling, silvering") shows meaningful deepening. Cost is legible in tears and relinquished memories, though agency remains somewhat passive rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (decoding vs. listening) deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. The scholar's surrender represents genuine renunciation with cost ("decades writing footnotes to footnotes"). Escalation through density increase works, though the magical transformation at the end slightly undermines earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from searching among sculptures to drawing the spiral to stepping into its center where "the years press against his skin like warm surf." The moment of recognition—"the sound of growing older was the moment you recognized the echo as yours and chose to keep it anyway"—deepens understanding with clear cost as he transforms into sculpture.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure escalates through the moon's intensifying tremors forcing Elara from diagnosis to understanding to surrender, with the spinning hand as both problem and solution. The stakes deepen from technical repair to existential reckoning with "escape velocity" as both physical formula and emotional truth.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes clearly established through time pressure (blood work, "before supper") and Mara's promise. The escalation through improvised music-making from mundane objects shows agency, though the resolution lacks struggle—Mrs. Eland's death arrives too peacefully without testing Mara's resourcefulness against genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's progression from drawing runes to activating the automaton to descending into the mirror chamber. The dominant stake - finding where shadows go/reuniting with her mother - tightens as each loop closes, though the truncated ending prevents full cost articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from discovery of the substitute body through revelation of the original child's skeleton to the transformation ritual. The changeling's confession ("I was borrowed") deepens pressure effectively. Cost manifests in the skeleton's dissolution and garden's sealing, though the emotional stakes could press harder on Ivy's personal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—providing light without fire after drought—escalates through the polishing process as the glass "began to weigh less even as its capacity to carry light grew." The pearl's transformation of the glass into village-wide aurora light provides meaningful resolution, though middle tension could tighten slightly between discovery and action.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural density as Lira moves from observation to active grafting, with the amber pendant's projection creating a meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding. The cost of choosing slow organic healing over immediate viral response is legible. One point off for the relatively gentle pressure—no active opposition tests her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulative encounters—each ghost hands over "what she had stolen," raising emotional stakes. The progression from boy to heroine shows deepening confrontation, with the heroine's mercy providing the crucial turn. The cost manifests in tears that "baptize" the fragment and the systematic erasure of its ridges, though the stakes could tighten more decisively in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the three-song sequence with each melody producing deeper restoration. The "final leaf falls" deadline creates genuine pressure. However, the conflict lacks resistance—the songs work perfectly without complication or setback, reducing tension despite the clear cost in overcoming generational silence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving starlight in a darkened world—builds through accumulative pressure as each folded creature and each heartbeat translation narrows Lira's options toward the final sealing. The cost manifests in the crumbling of discarded items and the physical toll ("joints protesting," "fingertips tingled"). The escalation follows the textural lens coherently but lacks a sharp reversal or opposition that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each angle adjustment deepens the emotional stakes—from the duke's warning to personal childhood memories to the final zero-degree infinity mirror. The wounded season's progression from pale sun to frost to healing creates time pressure that forces Arlen's decision.

== Grader: GPT-5 (low reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal—how to face slow extinction without spectacle—and escalation arrives via density: lone wing → spectral map → unhatched chrysalis → gradient collection. The chrysalis that “never emerged” is the clearest tightening, reframing loss from event to process. Cost is present as renunciation and elegiac acceptance rather than a hard trade‑off. A firmer on‑page foreclosure (time pressure from the returning storm altering her choices) would heighten pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates via discovery sequence: frost trail → obsidian shards → steaming gulch → kiln pool → projection. Knowledge deepens and narrows options, culminating in a moral stance shift.

Pressure is coherent and grows without needing an explicit antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming/transforming unused love) tightens via a decisive deepening: the pilgrim’s bowl crack revelation, then the touch that mends.

Escalation is coherent and culminates without coincidence solving it.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—knowing time’s texture at the risk of self—tightens as geometry literalizes pressure and her body begins to flake into light. Her choices drive escalation (opening the corridor; entering the maze of light) and the visible price is self‑dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake coheres: secure and plant the seeds under a collapsing regime.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is coherent: transform absence into a device tuned to betrayal. Escalation happens via density and a decisive deepening when the aurora flare unlocks the brother’s memory, reframing the sought “sound” as hush.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep stealing moments vs listen and release—tightens through the jar’s accumulating weight and the city’s quieting.

A single sharper mid‑scene test of commitment might intensify escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (reversing abandonment to build inquiry havens) is signaled and tightened by the discovery of “Safe Corridors” and the map’s terrace coordinates.

Lack of a stronger external counterforce keeps tension refined rather than acute.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming agency/identity—tightens with each discovery, culminating in the contract burning and refusal to “fall.” The film’s reveal meaningfully escalates pressure, narrowing options and forcing confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early: complete the map before the last star goes. Escalation is a steady tightening via accumulating silences, the legend, and the central dot that turns the page to black; the whispered command triggers the irreversible ending.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (escape the loop via owning guilt) is signaled and tightens: from ignoring, to attempted destruction, to deliberate integration.

Pressure coheres under the loop structure and the program’s constraint. The price paid—carrying regret as identity—is unmistakable in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether honesty can rebuild trust—is legible early and tightens when the ticket’s doodles resolve into confession and she replies in kind.

Escalation is gentle; resistance is minimal, but the price of exposure and acceptance is clear. The cadence deepening fits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear early: disprove “statistical indifference.” Pressure coheres and tightens via the ritual intensifying until the device silences, spikes, and cracks—the concrete reversal.

Still, the burial choice and device rupture make the escalation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear from the first paragraph; pressure coheres and tightens when the tunnel collapses and the whales’ dream‑songs thrash. Her sprint back across folding light is a single, meaningful intensification that narrows options to one. The price is emotional (proof tinged with grief) and physical risk, with no coincidences resolving the problem. Stakes remain intimate but felt.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres and tightens texturally: water rises, lanterns dim, silhouette appears, performance of silence becomes necessary, and the treble‑clef door moment crystallizes the stake. Agency drives the turns (tilting clarinet, spilling the note). The price is a relinquishment of a haunting for a quieter truth, felt but subtle. Stakes remain personal/artistic rather than perilous, which keeps the intensity measured.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—confession vs continued silence—tightens as they move from interior quiet to exposed tower to deliberate alteration of the image. The reversal comes with Elias’s choice to smudge glacier into cloud, narrowing the path of denial and enabling the weighing.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are concentrated: will Mara risk touching, turning, and shouldering the truth’s weight. Escalation is clean—first notch to 137g (tongue), then the emergent Jonah clip and the wheel’s self‑spin to 21g—tightening pressure and narrowing her stance. The cost is felt when she holds and releases the burden. Conflict is primarily internal but interwoven with concrete external prompts; no wasted beats.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure deepens via density and cadence: the portal opens, the silence intensifies, and time’s drift exacts a cost that reweights the stake. The key tightening is the felt stiffening of the swan’s fibers, forcing return and foreclosing further immersion. Stakes remain coherent—guard the silence versus the library’s ongoing crumble—without introducing new threads. The escalation is elegant but gentle, never quite forcing a wrenching sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—restoring connection without pain—is clear and deepens as the eclipse nears totality, with a meaningful tightening in the music’s modulation and the exchange of objects.

A slightly sharper on‑page dilemma just before the trade could raise the felt squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (what to do with memory when dreams are gone) tightens through the wall’s hunger, the wall’s song, and especially the discovery of her own diary. The reversal—reading the diaries in reverse—signals agency under pressure and culminates in a role shift. The cost is internal but palpable (letting go of the collector identity). Escalation is coherent under the accumulative lens, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure tightens credibly: intrusion, weapon, and a moral fork (continue covert service or risk exposure). Lin’s choice forecloses a path by destroying the cipher film and broadcasting, with a live threat of arrest. The subsequent institutional protection reduces aftershock cost, softening the edge of the climax. Still, internal and external conflicts interweave effectively at the gun/beam/tears beat.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prevent possession before completion—is signaled early; pressure coheres through a density increase of structured silence and rhetorical inversions. The key tightening is recording the anchor’s tremor and rephrasing the conflict as “what moves when nothing seems to?” culminating in the demon’s choice at the bow. The priest’s high competence reduces friction, but the acceptance/refusal hinge is credible and costs him material/numinous resources. Coincidence does not resolve anything; agency does.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—unlocking and conducting the unheard symphony—tightens under a live clock (exhaustion) and the patterning race across shell whorls. The hum, brightening horizon, and specific placements escalate pressure toward the baton‑lift and lake‑crack. Cost is present (exhaustion arriving; relinquishing spire and shell) and options narrow credibly. Slight softness: the external consequence is largely lyrical rather than oppositional, but the accumulative lens supports it.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: algorithmic generation glitches, the runes stop resetting, and a single constant forces confrontation with the core wound. The instruction “surrender the thread” reframes the initial goal, demanding a trade‑off. The throw forecloses a path with cost (giving up the tool and identity premise of retracing) and yields the earned stasis of gravity. Stakes remain internal but are dramatized physically.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reversing numbness—tightens via ritual commitment and the embodied test of placing her forehead to the drum. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial; the images unspooling backward deepen pressure and exact a price (tears, grief revisitation). The school coda demonstrates consequence rather than introducing a new turn, which fits scope. Stakes remain intimate and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (integrity vs disclosure under surveillance) is signaled early and tightens once via the soft latch and watcher’s presence, culminating in the stash decision. The price is foregoing immediate confession and risking misinterpretation or loss. Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens; one meaningful narrowing occurs when she chooses concealment over confrontation. A slightly stronger on‑page jeopardy would raise the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether to hoard or return the last memory; escalation is achieved through the scent deepening and the UV lights’ cadence shifts.

No antagonist is needed; the live trade-off is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to engage impossible choices without unraveling time—tightens as he moves from uncovering layers to the ethical pause to the decisive reweave. Internal vs. external pressure (beings’ auroras, the fugitive’s trace) coheres, with a clear narrowing at the hesitation beat. The price is his relinquishment of safe play and the implied risk of altering the weave. Tension is mostly interior but sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a textural lens, pressure deepens from stasis (chronic hush) to harmonics to fracture into possibility, culminating in a renunciatory act that forecloses playing. The felt price of giving up performance is legible and charges the ending. A single meaningful tightening occurs; while subtle, it’s sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (protect detachment vs. accept costly empathy) is signaled early and tightened as the blotter over‑absorbs and dissolves. The key turn arises from Vale’s agency in taking the buyer’s hand, foreclosing the dealer/client distance. Cost is legible: surrender of her survival method. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, but it’s coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on acknowledgment and communal uplift, tightening through the pact and public gathering under the library windows. Escalation is gentle; coincidence aids the locket’s return, and the price is primarily emotional rather than foreclosing a live option. Marisol’s agency initiates the project and declares continuation, but pressure never truly squeezes. The storm provides a useful but soft turn.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—belonging versus solitude—is signaled early and deepens when Arbor’s glyph appears, forcing a choice to act together. Escalation arrives through communal making and the vow scene, not via antagonism; it still narrows options by binding identity to the tag. The price is vulnerability and shared authorship rather than loss or conflict. Pressure is coherent but gentle, so tension never fully bites.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens when the only path requires borrowing time and paying with the giant’s sleep. Escalation coheres: staircase cost, cage, lock, and the timed release before inhalation. The release creates a decisive shift (resolved cadence) rooted in her agency. The price is palpable but not punishing, keeping pressure strong rather than brutal.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (how to live with ambiguous loss) is signaled and deepens through a single decisive intensification: ritual evokes a response, prompting the choice to leave the eyes and proceed.

Quiet but coherent pressure fits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (visibility as care) is signaled early and tightened when footsteps appear, forcing a trade‑off: safety/preservation vs. immediate aid. The meaningful turn is Lira reversing her caching plan to place the fragment under the board. Cost is legible (risk of exposure, loss of a prized shard from a finite set). Pressure remains coherent and grows with the deepening outage.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (relinquish control vs. grief’s stasis) is signaled early and tightened through storm intensification, leaf metamorphosis, and blackout. The crucial tightening beat is her decision not to “graft the change away” and to stay; cost is the surrender of schedule and procedure. Pressure remains coherent; the storm and plants provide situational force that catalyzes the internal choice. Slight gentleness of consequence keeps it just shy of searing.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—coherence/rest vs. clinging to the past—tightens as rain begins and tide returns, narrowing the window. The exchange is the decisive pressure point, with a visible price (relinquishing a personal relic) that reweights Ishka’s options. Internal and external pressures interweave cleanly. The only slight softness is the “without decision” phrasing before the edge, but the explicit handover restores agency.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—facing despair via “everyday magic” versus the seer’s failing certainty—tightens with the pearl’s transformation and the demand for witness. The meaningful turn is the corridor entry and choice to sing, which forecloses passive sight in favor of participatory making. Cost registers in relinquished certainty and acknowledgment of darkness. Pressure is coherent and rises through pattern‑breaks (song to heartbeat to plea) in line with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure accrues through patterned rituals (seventh planks, climbs, placements) that deepen the stake from cataloging to summoning return; the silence blown and the pendulum hanging are clear tightenings. Stakes remain primarily internal and conceptual, but they do narrow options toward an earned stance. The felt price is restraint and endurance under abandonment rather than a dramatic external consequence. Escalation is measured yet purposeful under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes—obtain the withheld sentence before the stars vanish—are legible early, and pressure coheres as images intensify toward the gate bite and confession. Agency drives turns: she boards, selects a seat, ascends stairs that exact a cost, and uses the punch. The deepening is conceptual more than combative, but the tightening is clear under the chosen lens. The resolution forecloses a prior tactic (mapping as control) for a costlier inward compass.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—how to hold wonder and grief, and whether to continue the fellowship—is clear and tightened by the tile’s invitation. Escalation is accumulative: each transcribed square deepens pressure until the personal date forces a stance. The price (tears, sleepless vigil, relinquishing the easy refusal) is legible and informs the promise to return. Quiet but firm narrowing replaces dramatic reversal appropriately for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is present early: risk the pocket’s integrity to learn what follows goodbye. Escalation is tangible—storm intensifies, corridors fold, planes rebel—before the decisive fusion. Cost is felt, though largely conceptual/emotional; the amulet’s destruction and near‑annihilation mark a credible price. A slightly smoother path to success keeps it shy of top‑band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is explicit and sustained: get the certificate stamped to end the hunt for her father. Pressure coheres and tightens at the director’s suspicious return and the “breach” pivot, forcing adaptation and risk. The price—moral complicity and self-erasure—is legible at closure. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her agency and timing drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—preserving recoverable textures before they vanish—tightens when the lamp starts “to forget,” which narrows options and forces him to speak and write faster. The brief turn (his intervention brightens the lamp and deepens the hum) credibly tests his method. The cost is partial rescue with loss: the hum fades; silence grows thicker, reweighting the win. Pressure is coherent and escalates within the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes—identity vs. erasure—intensify via pattern: rumors → warming label → door → jars → chorus → dissolution. The protagonist’s choices drive the turns (pressing the label; sorting jars; stepping into the boat). Cost is legible in the loss of an anchored name and acceptance of liminal selfhood. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial yet coherent and tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—testing myth vs. preserving meaning—tightens as she plays harder, the shell glows, cracks, and the star appears. Agency drives escalation; no coincidence resolves anything. A visible price is paid (object lost, blood, belief complicated), foreclosing easy comfort. Pressure coheres under the dusk clock and culminates in a stance shift.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (privatization vs. memory), and pressure coheres as dawn approaches with corporate barges. Lila’s proactive reorganization of the hull is a meaningful tightening that tests her competence. Yet there’s no visible price or narrowed option at the climax because the end is cut off, so escalation lacks a paid consequence on the page. We stop at confusion rather than a earned turn or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capture the last bloom before extinction—tightens through a real clock (30→20→10→5) and rising environmental pressure. The meaningful turn is the ignition/bloom convergence that forecloses failure and costs the hourglass grain. Escalation is coherent but largely linear; there’s no reversal beyond cadence tightening. Still, agency and cost are unmistakable at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (repair before the Orion departs) is announced and tightened by the loudspeaker and whistle ripple, which destabilize her workspace and force speed. The meaningful turn comes at the projection of the star map and the precise bearing decoded—pressure resolves through her chosen method. The price is chiefly time/attention under a live clock; minimal friction (no failed attempt or tool loss) keeps the escalation from peaking higher. Nonetheless the tightening is coherent and earned under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres and tightens through a single meaningful intensification: placing the two phrasebooks spine‑to‑spine unlocks the melt and forces Lira onto open water. Stakes remain focused (avoid disappearance by finding the source), with one clear deepening when the lake answers. Opposition is atmospheric rather than antagonistic; the price is understated but present. The earned cadence shift at the end reweights options without coincidence solving the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres via density and layering rather than antagonism: the rhythm gathers bodies, then the dead, culminating in the tuner’s relinquishment. The dominant stake—restore the town’s pulse—tightens through two meaningful escalations (bell, then arch) and a final stance shift. Cost is felt but understated; no hard trade‑off beyond renunciation, which keeps it below the highest band. Tension operates at cadence and image rather than conflict beats.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is focused and escalates: the clock ticks, the mechanism resists, realization forces a sacrifice. The key tightening is the insight that the temple stores instinct, not moments, which demands a renunciation. Cost is unmistakable—the fading of her mother’s last smile—while gaining a single perfect future instant. Pressure is coherent and grows without coincidence bailing her out.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming and reweaving the hush) is signaled early and tightens at the pulsing second door and through the mirror-threading. The escalation is accumulative: density increases, the hush sharpens from velvet to keening, culminating in mirrors cracking and collapse. The cost is internalized but concrete (accepting the burden and the ring). While largely interior, the pressure coheres and narrows options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (freeing his soul/settling the debt) is clear early, and escalation concentrates at the bead‑to‑fruit act where the greenhouse shudders. The visible price—her dissolution—reads on the page. However, there’s little active opposition or risk of failure beyond internal resolve, so the tightening is singular rather than layered. The turn still feels earned under the accumulative/causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (find a pattern to mend unraveling) intensifies through ritual escalation: warming plate, nautilus corridor, revealed seam, chant, canyon’s response. The trade‑off of sacrificing the plate for the stone boat and the labyrinth’s gentle sealing constitutes a credible price. Escalation is accumulation/pattern‑break rather than adversarial reversal, consistent with the lens. Slightly soft on immediate jeopardy, but the cost is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around whether she can meaningfully “restore” rather than merely visit: warnings raise ethical risk; the dig tests commitment; finding and aligning the gnomon tightens options and exacts a quiet price. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. Stakes remain intimate but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (to send the letter in a way that preserves meaning) is clear early and tightens at the “three paces away” hesitation. The added margin glyph and the final instruction foreclose blankness and instant send, articulating a trade‑off (speed/control vs. patience/vulnerability). Escalation is a density increase rather than reversal, fitting the lens. The price is mostly conceptual, but it’s felt in the surrendering act.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (preempt the synchronized coup) is signaled and tightened when the candle leans and footsteps approach. Escalation is protagonist-driven: she alters the chart into traps and sets the dawn beacon, foreclosing the option of passive observation. The visible prices (blood, time pressure, risk while feigning folly) register even without an on-page confrontation. Resolution is earned by her stance and plan, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (face the unsent apology) tightens as the song narrows, letters gain weight, and reflections confront her with past/younger selves. The key turn is the blood‑written apology; price is explicit and forecloses the prior path of avoidance. Escalation is coherent and pressure rises; no reliance on coincidence to resolve. One clean deepening is sufficient at this length and delivered.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning and solace while the brother undergoes surgery—is clear and coherently pressured. Escalation is a textural tightening: from waiting to decoding to the ritual request, foreclosing the path of passive dread. The cost is acceptance of trauma’s archive rather than resolution. No antagonist needed; pressure remains internal but focused.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early; pressure coheres around whether reclaiming joy incurs danger or debt. Escalation is a textural deepening: each painted layer thins fog, orchard “creaks warnings,” and Liora chooses to continue and then to display publicly. The cost is felt (spent cherub, dissolved network, ache), and the outcome is earned by her agency. The opposition is atmospheric rather than active, limiting overt tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether Lila will restore or accept the mural’s invitation; it tightens at the hobo’s bargain and crystallizes in the silence before his answer. Her decision to embed the coin and leave tools forecloses the path of certainty, with a tangible price. The escalation is a deepening under the accumulative lens rather than a string of reversals, which suits the design. Stakes remain intimate but consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—getting the message past auditors—is clear and escalates via mimic arrival, sirens, and swarm. One meaningful tightening occurs as the warp accelerates under pursuit, but the protagonist faces limited risk on the page and dispatches the mimic easily. The massed auditors at the end heighten pressure, yet consequence is largely atmospheric. A sharper on‑page cost or trade‑off would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmuting grief without erasure—is clear and escalates via density: wind’s verses → planting → vine → dream revelation → chapbook → stepping outside. The realization forecloses a path (eternal sleepless vigil) in favor of earned stasis with cost. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without needing antagonists. The postcard’s dissolution and renunciation of rigid mourning mark a strong tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (prevent a second death of a name), with a meaningful tightening (crack widens; cylinder crumbles) that compels adaptation. The protagonist’s decisions, not luck, resolve the conflict. The felt price skews conceptual rather than material, which slightly softens the bite of consequence at peak. Nevertheless, the escalation is coherent and resolves via agency.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (save the archive by dawn) is present early and tightens with Arden’s entrance and the crews’ arrival. Escalation comes via accumulative music-to-collective binding, culminating in Arden’s public decision. However, resistance is limited—Arden yields quickly and the crews simply pause on hearing song—so the price is felt but light. A sharper test or trade-off at the threshold would raise pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—balance power vs. mountain’s rest—is clear early and tightens at the lever pull with real risk. Escalation is quiet but coherent: precise tension to avoid awakening magma while restoring water. The visible price is muted (no on-page loss; slower turbines are imagined), keeping the pressure more ethical than visceral. Still, the agency-driven act convincingly reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (can she stop rewriting herself and risk trust?) is clear and tightens via the cat’s kill, the self‑forging spiral, and especially the boy’s letter. Agency drives the turn: she sends off the meteorite, opens every cage, and consigns proofs to the stove. The visible prices (loss of talisman, surrender of curated identity) charge the final image. Quiet escalation fits the lens without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reach the father/understand sacred thresholds—is coherent and tightens via deciphering, stilling the maze, and committing to descent. Pressure stems from necessity and risk rather than antagonism; the terrace tilt and living maze create real stakes. The earned reunion springs from her choices, not luck. The felt price is quiet but present.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are internal yet coherent (to belong by captivating the city), with one strong tightening when her birth chart appears, reweighting the encounter. The feather’s consumption and the sunrise clock mark cost and narrowing options, and her agency drives the escalations. Pressure remains gentle rather than oppositional, but the accumulative deepening is clear and purposeful. Resolution arises from her stance and ritual rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are focused (plant seeds before memory fades to learn why paths disappear), and escalation arrives through patterned deepening: seed one (question), seed two (cave’s “sleep”), seed three (mirror/child self). The tightening culminates in a values trade: accept cyclical mystery over pathway recovery. Pressure is soft but coherent under the chosen lens, with a felt shift in options.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure accrues through orchestrated demonstrations (rolling marbles to triangle; syrup halo) that coherently deepen the premise. Stakes are primarily conceptual—can order invite wonder—so escalation feels elegant rather than fraught. The key tightening is the controlled convergence around the bishop and the public reconfiguration that follows. The cost remains understated, keeping this below high‑band tension.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes center on recovering memory despite the ban, with one meaningful tightening when the “anchor” snaps and the garden claims her, narrowing options. The visible price—binding herself to the place—charges the resolution. Escalation is driven by her agency (observing gaps, tracing, inscribing), though the lack of on‑page antagonist keeps pressure subtle. Still, the turn from rehearsal to irrevocable seal reads earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure escalates quietly but credibly: the clouds arrive, the panes ignite with meaning, and the tide‑pool communion forces a decision about leaving the panes. The dominant stake—proving value in the mundane—tightens into a concrete sacrifice under a live clock. The cost is felt but understated; an additional on‑page obstacle could have sharpened the turn. Still, the single meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (atonement via translation) are established early and intensify as the ritual proceeds to the aurora and sky‑word, narrowing her internal options. The meaningful tightening is the shift from bargaining with fire to repricing innocence; cost is acceptance rather than erasure. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens. The conflict stays internal but never static.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent—transmuting despair across timelines—and escalate via density: more complex patterns, the first burst into a star, then the timelines align and balloons return. The tightening arrives when the experiment reframes from exporting to importing healed fragments, narrowing her path. The cost is modest (releasing the gauge and prior approach), so pressure feels serene rather than fraught. Still, escalation is driven by her sustained agency under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around whether to unseal and translate the corridor’s dreams despite legacy’s imposed silence. Escalation occurs via the discovery and use of the negative’s coordinates, culminating in the chamber’s vision that forces a stance. The price is an accepted burden rather than an external antagonist; it reads as sufficient at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: persuade mirrors within the hush window. Escalation accrues through density and a live clock: the mirrors begin to hum back, jasmine blooms, and the bell’s imminent strike tightens the window. The price is quiet—she trades the open hush for a settled, internalized beat—but it’s felt as a foreclosed option and a shift in status with the mirrors. Conflict is lyrical rather than oppositional, yet the pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—redemption via ritual—tightens when Kelis arrives and places the harmonica, foreclosing the option of solitary self-absolution. The prohibition on speech adds pressure; the cost is accepting presence without apology. Escalation is quiet but real: the circle completes, the clipboard “throbs,” and she chooses endurance over declaration. The tension is internal and lyric rather than adversarial, yet it reads with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—beauty/echo versus profit/power—is flagged early and tightened through concrete steps (placing the egg, pouring contraband water, the song summoning the river). The key pressure point is her withheld command to reseal the sky, a costly renunciation. Internal and external stakes braid cleanly. Tension escalates sentence‑by‑sentence to the charged refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (freeing erased voices/defying the empire) is signaled early and tightens as she moves from single thread to total release and structural collapse. Agency drives the turn; the visible prices are sanctuary loss and bearing the prism’s weight. The main limitation is low direct resistance or trade-off mid-scene, making the arc feel inevitable rather than contested.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—can storytelling deescalate harm—appears early and accumulates texture via reversals and collaborative invitation. The confession is a genuine deepening; the audience’s participation signals a potential narrowing of options toward listening over reloading. Yet the pressure peaks softly and the incomplete ending undercuts the felt price. Escalation reads, but the cost never crystallizes on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are coherent: can remembrance be made to hold in a world of drift and last migrations. The pressure deepens via density shifts (downdraft, monarch’s departure, wing landing; the city in shadow; knot’s chime) rather than antagonism. The loosening knot and slack thread register as a price and a narrowing of options—her memorial must live and fade without her. The escalation is quiet but unmistakable under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake (preserve names) is present from the outset and tightens as the ritual risks reawakening guilt. Escalation is a textural intensification (aurora brightens; rope resonates; names release), culminating in the irrevocable act of impressing the names into wax. The cost is primarily internal but legible. A single tightening beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserving self-as-interpreter vs. becoming the walker—tightens as the directive turns predatory and time (storm) compresses. The key deepening arrives with the forbidden self-dream (“You were never the interpreter; you were the message”), forcing a trade: identity for transcendence. The rope-of-dreams and step through the arch are agency-driven turns with a visible price. Consequences carry into the ending (erasure, mushrooms/echo footsteps).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve the turning sky—is clear and tightens from nightly work to a single moral calculus at the chamber. The seventh-dusk stilling and the voice-diagram offer a credible escalation and test of values. The choice extracts a visible price (future nights and charts), not a symbolic dodge. Pressure is coherent and protagonist-driven throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes (ending the echo of anthems by unlearning resentment) emerge early and tighten when Lira refuses to rearm the music box, then risks herself to impart the lullaby to soldiers and commits to a life inside hush. Escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, but it narrows her options (she forecloses the weapon path and chooses endurance). The visible price is time and self-renunciation. The piece avoids external opposition, yet pressure accumulates credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (recover/understand the dream) tightens through the breathing method and the decisive recognition that she must become a bridge, not a cage. The key deepening is when the sextant’s reflection reveals her complicity—this reweights tactics and forecloses the trapping path. Escalation is lyric rather than confrontational but coherent under the chosen lens. The price is renunciation of her prior practice, lightly but clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear early: mend the breach and the bond. Pressure coheres and tightens through the climb and the graft‑healing turn, culminating in the on‑page choice to release vows via song, which forecloses hoarding memory. The daughter’s “uncertain sparrow” presence crystallizes the need to act without speech. The cost is legible and the trade‑off (memory for reconciliation/community thaw) charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—know versus keep self—tightens through one decisive deepening: the shell as seed reweights pursuit into sacrifice. Attempts escalate (inquiry fails, visions surge, reflection warns) until she must choose. The choice to press the cameo into the oldest tree both resolves and exacts cost. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative pattern with a clear narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stakes (rescuing unlearned wisdom by renegotiation) are signaled early and tighten meaningfully at the guardian’s demand and the portal’s impending closure. The major turn is Elara offering transformation over preservation; price is paid when she foregoes returning. Pressure is coherent but mostly conceptual; conflicts rarely snag on stubborn obstacles, which keeps tension high‑level rather than visceral. Still, the agency at the end is decisive and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (recover names/sister) and coherently tightens: follow the chord, thread the memories, reach the engine, choose at the rail. The price is unmistakable: relinquishing the ship and card to save a reconstituted self. Internal and external pressures interweave without redundancy. No antagonist needed; pressure grows from environment and vow.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (restore the erased accord) is clear and escalates via the rope’s reconfiguration and the door’s opening. Pressure is mostly atmospheric; there’s no opposing force beyond the enchantment and time-of-night strangeness. The decisive deepening is the braid crossing that triggers the door; the visible price is modest and conceptual. Stakes remain felt but never perilous, keeping tension elegant but subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (transforming hoarded silence into resonant balance) tightens through the confrontation and her relinquishment. The deepening is character‑driven: refusal, recognition, then surrender. Costs are felt (grief space carved; relinquishing her hoard logic), but escalation stays gentle and the cut ending mutes the final price beat.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens when the shard bleeds darkness; following the “breadcrumb” forces trust in coincidence under pressure. Escalation is primarily procedural‑lyric, but the reversal (silence threatening to swallow her) tests commitment. The cost is present though not punishing; the piece favors reconfiguration over damage. Resolution flows from her choices rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—what and how to remember—is pressured by the time‑bound mapping and the obelisk’s impossible shadow. The tightening comes when her ledgering method fails ethically, forcing a trade: abandon curation for acknowledgment of grief. The cost is explicit and felt (naming the erased dead; letting ache into the archive) and the outcome is earned by her agency. No antagonist needed; escalation coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are signaled early (defy hopelessness); escalation proceeds through a meaningful deepening when the mosaic reveals itself as a lock and later when the cannon becomes a bouquet. The price is present but soft—she spends her storied rag and binds herself to return. No antagonist or hard reversal, but under the accumulative lens the density and cadence shift sufficiently. A touch more friction or risk at the ignition or cannon beat could heighten cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—bridging a sibling silence—tightens when Mara arrives and when the cicada reveals the unmailed letter. The tide’s resumption functions as a cadence shift and soft deadline, and returning the cicada forecloses staying in magical stasis. The price is emotional: tears, acceptance of maternal choice, and a quiet endurance rather than a solved debate. Escalation is textural, not reversal‑driven, but the deepening is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (carrying quiet to survive and transform bunker life) tightens via the time limit, the sacrifice of the doll, and the test of muting an alarm. Escalation is accumulative: gathering flavors → applying them under duress → teaching the father → years-later reconfiguration. Costs are gentle but legible (leaving the doll, the constrained window, emotional exposure in teaching and weeping). Resolution arises from Lira’s agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—holding and reshaping the hush for a grieving child—is signaled early and deepens coherently. The meaningful tightening comes at the involuntary sigh, which transforms the device and reweights the space. Stakes remain intimate; the cost is internal and scaled to length, though pressure is gentler than sharp. Agency is endurance and guided attention rather than a dramatic choice, but it’s earned and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear (complete the stairway and claim/keep the throne’s memory before sunrise), and pressure coheres as the murals demand truth and dawn approaches. The meaningful tightening arrives when she must feed the staircase true history to proceed. The price is more conceptual than bodily, but it does foreclose the path of cultural forgetting. Drones add external pressure without resolving the conflict by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—learn to breathe absence—tightens as shadows encroach and the boundary dissolves, culminating in stepping forward. The escalation is more density/cadence than reversal, but the cost is felt (mother/friend losses, scar language). Agency drives the turn (placing/pressing/rising/stepping). Slightly low friction mid-scene; tension relies on lyric pressure over concrete obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: turn guilt and collapsed‑pyramid debts into transformed value without reverting to greed. Escalation deepens through concrete beats (texts intensify, descent narrows options, spores form her younger self, a warning against greed forces renunciation). The decisive internal act under external pressure has cost and narrows future options. Tension blends internal ethics with a tangible, high‑pressure ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and legible: end the dynasty versus integrate a destabilizing truth. Escalation tightens at the “smash/burn” fork and deepens again when the handle’s coordinates demand an outward act, narrowing options to a non‑blood solution with cost. Pressure remains coherent; the price is identity loss rather than spectacle. A slightly greater sense of what the blood option would have cost on the page could have sharpened the trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the oath to re‑stitch reality—tightens through the crate reveal, puppet animation, merger, and threshold crossing. Escalation is protagonist‑driven; the unsnapping choice and physical grafting read as an irrevocable price. Pressure is largely internal rather than opposed, but the scene’s ritual logic supplies sufficient heat. The final step forecloses the prior path of exile.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reconciling with unknown histories through a small relic) tightens via the Polaroid discovery and the choice to tell a different story. The meaningful turn is internal but concrete—envelope kept near the heart, vow to magnify kindnesses, and forgiveness of the father—foreclosing a grievance path. Costs are felt, if quiet. Pressure remains coherent without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—keeping erased histories alive—tightens via stealth constraints and the morally costly choice to let the pamphlet boy pass. The drones’ “ignore stillness” rule adds tension, and the booth access moment is a concrete threshold. However, after the broadcast begins, obstacles don’t escalate, so cost is more conceptual/endurance than immediate jeopardy. One added on‑page complication post‑press would have deepened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is explicit and pressured by the amplifying property of the atrium and the etched code. Escalation tightens at the frost spiral revelation and the knowledge that completion would broadcast “marching orders.” The key turn—whispering through negative space instead of playing—narrows options with a felt renunciatory price. External opposition is soft, but the “vested hush” functions as coherent pressure within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—decode/accept becoming guardian—is signaled early and tightens at “only one leaf remained.” The decisive act (placing the last monument with personal skin) forecloses his human path with a clear price. Pressure grows coherently via density of signs and the hush deepening; escalation is protagonist‑driven, not coincidental. Consequences are not walked back; the outcome is irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on whether Elian will orient by uncertainty; pressure coheres via pattern intensification (three clocks at 11:17) and the deepening descent. Agency drives turns (choosing the trapdoor, dipping the rose, fusing, repurposing his craft), and the price is relinquishing fixed bearings. External resistance is minimal, but the accumulative density compensates. The widow’s backward clock provides a tangible risky outcome that could alienate clients, implying real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres around one stake and tightens through staged ritual escalations (Libra tipping, Scorpio hint, Leo ignition, Virgo flip). The sunrise‑bound fate rule and the solitude after the search party quietly compress options. Cost is emotional and conceptual rather than bodily, but it’s legible and paid: she forecloses the fantasy of erasure and accepts transformed burden. The escalation is subtle yet decisive for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is focused (integrate the escaped laughter) with a clear tightening at the wind aperture’s pure note. Agency drives the turn (uncorking vials; transferring the tooth) and forecloses a path (she loses her cache; accepts release over hoarding). Pressure is more spiritual than perilous, so the risk feels gentle rather than harrowing, but it coheres and deepens. The cost carries into the quiet, tuned ending.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finding a path to mercy/healing under the strap’s constraint—is signaled early and tightened through the “seventeen” misstep and corrective reversal. Agency drives escalation: deliberate grounding, breath control, and Fibonacci counting alter options. Costs (remorse for the named person; surrendering the strap into a grave‑like marker) are legible. Pressure coheres and deepens to a clear cadence shift at the spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to honor and transmit overlooked histories—tightens through the portal sequence to the parapet and culminates in the paid memory and the refusal to follow. The exchange in salt provides a visible price that reweights options. Pressure is lyric rather than adversarial, yet coherent and escalating under the chosen lens. A sharper external pinch point would raise urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—lift the “weightless burden” by uncovering and resolving what’s above—tightens through a clear turn when she chooses to “engage” and physically opens the ceiling. The escalation is a measured deepening (textural cadence build) rather than a reversal, but the narrowing of options is evident once the mirrors show time compressed. Price and consequence are legible at resolution. Slight softness: obstacles are minimal, so pressure relies on mood more than opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (rupture of perfection to grasp eternity) is clear and escalates via decisive deepening beats. Her choices drive the tightening—first a controlled breach (“Farewell”), then reversal (“Remember”), then total release (all bottles). Cost is visible: the library falls apart; she sacrifices the existing system and possibly selfhood’s stability. Some tension stays conceptual over visceral, but pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—who owns the past/time—tightens through the mirror fear, Solenne’s “theft” charge, and the collective method choice. The tangible price is Mara’s renunciation of possession and identity recalibration. However, external pressure (Company enforcers) dissipates quickly, easing the climb. The meaningful deepening is clear even if the opposition yields with minimal friction.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure escalates coherently: the rust’s counteraction and Emil’s doubt narrow options, then Midnight’s arrival forces a higher‑stakes choice. The decision to reveal the frightened child and fuse essences meaningfully forecloses the simpler “defeat” path. The price—accepting an in‑between hour—reweights the initial goal without deflating stakes. Tension operates at sentence and beat levels without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—whether to cross into the place where explanations fail—tightens steadily through the dive and compass’s reorientation. The decisive turn arrives at the membrane; her renunciation forecloses a path with a conceptual and emotional price. Tension is sourced from want versus need (longing vs. “choreography of wonder without coordinates”). External antagonism is minimal, but the internal conflict escalates credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes consolidate around whether Mara will assume and sustain the loop—quiet but coherent. Escalation is accumulative: Older Mara’s arrival and exit tighten options; the travelers’ contributions deepen obligation; the blank slide demands a renewed act of creation. The cost is ongoing stewardship and the relinquishment of a simpler, solitary path. Pressure is steady rather than spiky, but purposeful for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: answer the night-blooming question before winter, deepened by the mother’s silence. The meaningful tightening arrives when she refuses the candle, risking the loss of her method to meet the older invitation. The found postcard resets knowledge but doesn’t solve the conflict; her agency drives the culminating synchronicity. Stakes remain intimate yet clear, with a visible trade-off in relinquishing control.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering and honoring the disappeared—tightens as empathy becomes the only workable method, culminating in the ritual naming. The key turn is the parley that unlocks the clasp and reconfigures options, followed by the choice to speak the names, accepting the burden. Cost is primarily ethical/emotional rather than physical but is legible and tied to action. A slightly stronger on‑page counterpressure could have heightened escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to pursue wish‑based revival or conceive a labor‑based covenant—is signaled early and tightens when he speaks the blueprint and sets down the bottle. The escalation is a deepening rather than a reversal, consistent with the chosen lens. Cost is the renunciation of ease and the solitude of departure; absence of an opposing force limits visceral tension. The closing image confirms a reweighted future without undercutting the earned price.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (restore the city’s listening/foghorns) is clear, with escalation via the unbidden Latin, prophecy groove, and the realization of a broken collective promise. The tightening compels Elowen to trade archival purity for active vow‑making, a visible price. Pressure is more lyrical than combative but remains coherent under the chosen lens. No wasted turns or convenience fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (open without breaking) tightens as the ritual succeeds and then imperils the membrane. The key turn is her choice to stop and reseal, foreclosing deeper immediate access to “borrowed time.” The price is legible and scales to this length. Tension builds through cadence and image rather than reversals, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are quiet but coherent: calibrate balance without tipping into fury. Escalation is the cadence to zero hour, the bell’s inhalation, and the managed diminuendo that requires attention and restraint. The visible price is acceptance of ongoing duty rather than a dramatic loss. Under the accumulative lens, the single decisive intensification and its cost read.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (reviving a silenced sky) escalate through a meaningful deepening: from observation to empathic tracing to the high‑cost opening of his chest. The tightening forecloses a safer, aloof stance and makes him a conduit, after which meteors reconfigure their behavior. The price is felt in bodily flicker and surrender to void. Pressure remains coherent without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes center on whether silence can be translated and borne; escalation deepens via the realization that the covenant is a confession and through the ritual of reading strips. The cost becomes legible in the choice to remain and accept the burden. Pressure is coherent but largely internal and ceremonial, with limited jeopardy or hard trade‑offs. One sharper on‑page test of price would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the capsule/message of time’s texture—is clear and deepens via the airplane’s return and the fused compass. Escalation fits the lens: increasing sensory-texture pressure and the unexpected buyer summons narrow options toward a meeting. The cost is primarily emotional and existential rather than tactical, but it’s felt and reweights the future. No luck-based resolution; her tactics trigger the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through densities and pattern breaks (gull discord, triad hum, the act of writing “unfinished”). The meaningful tightening is a revaluation: from loss to release, with erasure as a real price she permits. While external stakes are low, agency appears in attention and tending that foreclose the “finish it” path. The cadence shift near the end marks the escalation cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is renewing the interspecies treaty before death, and pressure tightens via finite time and successive secrets. Escalation is a density increase: each system added (doorways, organ‑vine, seismograph) narrows remaining options and drains stamina, culminating in the final climb and last wire. The cost—her life given into the system she built—is unmistakable. Lack of overt opposition keeps it quiet but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—earn real homecoming knowledge versus a sanctioned simulacrum—tightens through the climb and crystallizes at the amber placement. The reversal (“miracle dismantling her”) raises cost and compels action. Escalation is coherent for the chosen lens; the final hum/wings is an earned deepening rather than a deus ex machina. Slightly soft on explicit external jeopardy, but internal stakes feel sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore life and concord—tightens through the heron’s sign and the last‑pod decision at the liminal tide line. Escalation is modest but coherent: birds inform tactics; the circle concentrates effort; the final seed forecloses retries. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, but it reads on the page via “the last” and the mother’s ash. Absence of overt antagonist is offset by persistent environmental pressure (poisoned soil, dead reef).

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres through deepening density: from wind-hushed slag to the cylinder’s unintelligible sighs, to the amber blaze projecting a forest, narrowing the path from travel to listening. Stakes—translating distance into closeness—are signaled early and tested by the choice to attend rather than act outwardly. The price is an internal renunciation rather than a visible loss, but it’s felt. Quiet, but the single meaningful tightening is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early (save those caught vs. risk joining them), and pressure tightens with the sighting of Lys and the threshold decision. Agency drives escalation: aligning the compass, choosing to sketch rather than cross, pressing the rose to the chronometer. Cost is present but somewhat mitigated by the success of the chosen tactic. Still, the renunciation forecloses a path with stakes felt at the decision point.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake—amending the wrong sky—tightens through the ritualized swap and culminates in Kael’s risk to pour the dawn. The pressure meaningfully deepens when the spire cracks and the price is framed as releasing fear/identity. The cost is primarily internal-symbolic but it forecloses a path (the safety of aliases). Tension is steady, if more lyrical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake (renouncing scripted roles to become an archivist of the overlooked) tightens through ritualized attempts that gain potency (REMEMBER → FORGIVE → OBSERVE → STAY). The key cost is the commitment to “benevolent ruthlessness,” cutting away nostalgia and accepting duty. While quiet, escalation is unmistakable under the accumulative lens as the gallery’s responses grow from whispers to clear sanction. The final choice forecloses withdrawal and solitude without service.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming a living home/identity—tightens as she descends, accepts the feather’s memory‑cost, and finally speaks the world‑shaping word. The meaningful turn is the decision to stop “decorative” seeing and use the tongue despite its price. Stakes stay personal but consequential; pressure grows coherently. Slight ease in the final stretch (few obstacles once the core is reached) trims peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes are clear early (self‑forgiveness) and pressure coheres: legend → hush intensifies → tapestry indictments → king topple. The middle tightening—decoding forbidden “e2 to e4” and confronting his pedagogical flaw—narrows options credibly. Resolution stems from his choice to accept release rather than solve or master. Slight smoothness in his path softens the sense of a sharp trade‑off, but the cost is still felt.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—breaking the Council’s penance regime—is signaled early and tightened by the impending ritual. The meaningful turn is her public reading that triggers the towers’ refractive bloom and halts the ritual. However, opposition folds too readily; the guards’ conversion arrives without a counter‑pressure beat that exacts a sharper price. Escalation is coherent and protagonist‑driven, if somewhat cushioned.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is explicit and pressured: if narration falters, the statue crumbles and the workshop sinks. Escalation tracks via density and time pressure (mainspring crack; “quilt faster”), culminating in the statue’s approval, sacrifice, and the binding duty. The cost is legible and ongoing; agency drives the turn rather than luck. The piece resists soft resets, allowing the deepened burden to carry forward.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to honor the promise—tightens as the path turns inland and the lagoon rises. The meaningful deepening arrives with the bleeding pigments and the command to “stay long enough to forgive the leaving,” forcing a renunciatory choice. Cost remains legible in the forfeit of the sunrise and the acceptance of a permanent fracture. Pressure grows coherently without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (proving whispers’ reach) tightens as the tower’s vibration escalates from hum to demand, forcing Mara to choose between whisper and scream. The meaningful turn forecloses the path of gentleness alone; she pays with a consuming, identity‑level scream. Pressure remains coherent and internal/external conflicts entwine (her need vs. the beam’s stutter). Consequences ripple outward immediately and credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reaching the lost brother) is clear and pressure coheres as pattern intensifies: “Build the cradle that rocks backward” is a decisive tightening. Costs are tangible (wire cuts, searing bronze, leaving the station) and force commitment at “Cross.” Escalation is protagonist-driven, not coincidental. The luminous path and rim pause sharpen the peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (keep the orchard/cliff from collapsing and manage Lira’s truth constraint) is clear early. Pressure tightens when fear itself threatens the roots, the branch cracks, and rain escalates; the only live option becomes a risky, belief-straining tactic: plant the eye. Agency drives the turn; the visible price is the ongoing vigilance and self-regulation embedded in her caretaker role. Stakes remain coherent and interwoven with her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is coherent: understand/contain the stranger’s bequeathed memories. Escalation is a textured tightening—studying gaps, receiving the first vivid borrowed memory, then actively “pouring” memories into named vacancies. The cost is present (he accepts burden; the flower wilts), and the vow forecloses a path (his own forgetting). A single decisive deepening rather than multiple turns, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early (change Lila’s fate vs. honor her choice), and pressure tightens at the lintel: decide now or lose the door. The mirror’s offer creates a trade‑off with clear loss; the bloom’s fade and rising creek add situational squeeze. Resolution arises from Elias’s agency and renunciation with a visible consequence (door seals). Slightly quiet external opposition, but internal/external interlock carries.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early (sky’s imminent unraveling vs. queen’s inner fracture), and pressure tightens from balcony to cave to ritual. The decisive act—embracing rather than resisting the spark—forecloses a path (conquest) with visible reweighting of status. Costs are mostly internal; external danger abates without counter‑force testing her commitment post‑choice. Nevertheless, escalation reads as coherent and protagonist‑driven under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused on whether to keep bottling time or risk unbottled presence; the meaningful tightening occurs with the admission “we were wrong” and the sacrifice of the last pocket‑sun. The trade‑off forecloses a path (their prior method) and reweights the relationship. Pressure is more lyric than adversarial, but it coheres and deepens. A touch more resistance before the crush could heighten felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes center on whether she will keep controlling story/time or relinquish it; escalation is coherent: blood → lift‑off → confrontation with selves → demand for an ending → burn. The price is clear: she surrenders the hoarded words and timeline, renouncing a long‑held defense. The gravestone image and jealousy apply pressure without needing an antagonist. Resolution is by renunciation with credible cost that reconfigures her options.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure deepens coherently under the accumulative lens: from diagnosis by touch to the risky, almost superstitious insertion of the heirloom into the heart of the clock. The single decisive tightening is clear when she abandons “cheating” scent and commits the screw, foreclosing passive mourning for active reconfiguration. Cost is quiet but legible: she accepts a different, less certain modality of sensing. Stakes remain intimate but consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is explicit: complete the ceremony before breath breaks or fall. Escalation is crisp under the chosen lens: the platform lurch, crystallizing scars, the sky’s growl, lung pain—tightening toward a single decisive shedding. Agency resolves the conflict; coincidence does not. Costs are felt, though aftermath is tidy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—apology before destruction—stays tight and escalates with the saws starting mid-scene. Her agency drives the deepening: choosing induced currents, addressing the ghost in metaphors, and placing the drop on the blank measure. The price is acceptance of loss and a reconfigured outcome rather than reversal; the piece earns this with the “imperfect miracle” motif. Slightly muted antagonism (no adversary but time) keeps it just shy of maximal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are internal—unraveling separation—and escalate as spiral arbitration tightens and the dictionary empties. The crucial tightening occurs at the blank mirror and the verdict, forcing the trade-off: relinquish witness identity to unify. The price is legible and carried by concrete acts. While not adversarial conflict, the pressure coheres and deepens under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—alignment of clock and horizon as proxy for truth—tightens when the expected coincidence fails and he must choose between correction and commemoration. The reversal (“coincidence failed”) reweights options; the second adjustment and acceptance of slow time embeds cost. Escalation is internal but coherent under the accumulative lens. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential for the character’s code.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—what to do when a boundary lets go first—and tightens through the lattice sequence and the farm’s “inhale.” The protagonist’s acts (testing, entering, drawing, offering) drive the deepening, and the cost (diffused grief, loss of the companion) is paid on the page. Stakes are internal-external braided, consistent with the accumulative lens. Not a combative conflict, but escalation is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reconciling love, time, and risk—tightens via the successive scrawls culminating in the directive to the roof. The meaningful turn is her assent to “magical thinking” under a responsible ethos, with a price in dignity and emotional exposure. Pressure is coherent though quiet, appropriate to the lens. A slightly softer sense of what she risks in not going prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether Mara can transmute endings and accept the same transformation—tightens via the loop’s escalation and Lila’s plea. The meaningful turn is Mara asking Lila to “speak the ending” and then choosing to dial her own number, paying with selfhood. The price is legible (disc shatters; Mara dissolves). Pressure is cohesive without reliance on coincidence to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the covenant—tightens when the jetty begins to vanish and she must either retreat or continue witnessing. The meaningful turn is the refusal to step back, recorded via her own method (“proximate causes of her staying”). Cost is visible in thinning into annotation and accepting ongoing burden. The escalation is coherent and reader-felt without relying on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are focused: barter solitude for a chance at connection via reciprocity, tested by parting with the stone. Escalation is a deepening (rumor → test on scale → commitment on rails → hum, map, list) that narrows options to trust and release. The cost is visible; tension is primarily internal and textural rather than confrontational. A minor added resistance could heighten pressure, but the lyric mode sustains the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (locate the stillpoint to plumb emotional depths) is signaled early, with pressure building via density and pitch of notes toward the stillpoint. The tightening beat—naming grief as the missing chord—forces a trade: accept pain to pass. Escalation is internal but coherent under the chosen lens, with a clear narrowing of options. External jeopardy is minimal, but the emotional price reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are coherent: repair the harm caused by earlier words, knowing each kindness spawns another sorrow. Escalation arrives through successive edits that tighten options and raise price (mercy → justice; plague reframed; pen heats and then fails). The nib’s snap forecloses further tampering, pushing a stance shift to witnessing. Pressure remains focused without contrived antagonism.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes center on whether he can make silence sing and be held by a world that’s forgotten him; pressure coheres and deepens as he escalates from signing to immersion. The meaningful tightening is the descent into the water and the final arpeggio, which forecloses the path of looking back. The price—enduring anonymity and choosing forward motion—lands in the departure beat. No antagonist is needed; internal and environmental pressures suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reanimate the promise—remains coherent and tightens via an artistic gauntlet. The mirror’s refusal and exhaled key constitute a meaningful turn that narrows options and forces adaptation. Cost is visible in the final self‑effacing step into the sarcophagus. Escalation is more devotional than adversarial, but pressure builds credibly for this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—identity versus entanglement under medical control—is signaled early and tightened when the lagoon personifies donor longing and issues the key choice. The deepening pivots on Elara’s decision to slow, then drink and release, which forecloses being a passive repository. Cost and pressure remain coherent (she cannot change the system tonight; the regimen continues). Escalation is quiet but unmistakable via pattern intensification and cadence shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: private mission → secret door → pace‑matching trial → whisper broadcast. The meaningful tightening is the rule to “match my stride,” which narrows tactics and leads to the mic’s dare. Resolution is earned by Mara’s softness, but the price paid is more conceptual than visceral; no option foreclosed beyond the coin cooling. Tension runs steadily, if quietly, rather than spiking with a hard reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether light can be taught into the water to reach the lost child; escalation is delivered by increasing pattern density (from opening shutters to braiding). The decisive tightening is the woven starlight that produces the pearl and the nonverbal exchange. Costs are mostly conceptual (silence, acceptance that retrieval isn’t the aim), which slightly softens visceral stakes. Still, the earned soothing of the canal reads as a real price paid and a stance fixed.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes center on whether a “quiet rearrangement” can alter lives; escalation is delivered via density—the spread of synchronized displays and the ticking to twilight. The absence of opposition or complication keeps pressure modest; everything works on the first try. The cost is mostly conceptual (choosing shimmer over shout), which reads but doesn’t bite. Still, the dusk synchronization and town reactions provide one clear tightening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—authenticity vs. safety—is pressured by the island’s imminent vanishing and the world’s enforced politeness. The meaningful tightening is the sunrise deadline plus the offer to carry fierceness “without a blade.” The decision to stay forecloses her old life with felt social and existential cost. Tension layers internally (fear) and externally (deadline) without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—making space for grief under enforced cheer—tightens as the performer moves from whittling to plucking to gifting the hollow heart. The farmer’s choice to finally touch, then accept, narrows options and breaks an internal stalemate. Visible price is paid in the quiet tears and the performer’s relinquished bouquet (to dust). The escalation is modest but precise and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—crossing forbidden symmetry—tightens through one meaningful deepening as the ban becomes about mirror/echo, not speech. Agency drives turns: paraphrasing to gain entry, notebook to rewrite rule, choosing translation over trespass. Prices are internal (she sheds fear, name, shadow edges), with limited tangible jeopardy. Tension is lyrical rather than peril‑driven but coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (what she will trade to awaken beauty) tightens when she accepts the bargain and the plants externalize her cost as painful memories. The clear note and its embodied price escalate pressure to a credible turn: she chooses a practice that depends on embracing imperfection and its ongoing toll. Quiet, but the reweighted options are unmistakable. No contrived antagonism; agency drives the deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (discovering the “texture of connection”) are clear and deepen as pattern-density increases; the meaningful tightening arrives when the fork hum enters her chest and she chooses to sing and then to open all jars. The decisive shift at the end (becoming keeper) is earned, though the on-page price is gentle and conceptual rather than sharply costly. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative/Textural lens without needing antagonism. A slightly clearer felt sacrifice would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes cohere around whether grief becomes tending; pressure tightens when the caretaker illuminates the cranes and the garden overlays the hall, forcing a stance. The turn—placing the locket into earth—forecloses a path and redefines her craft. Cost is legible (letting go of mourning function; the caretaker’s eventual death). Escalation is primarily density/texture rather than conflict, but it credibly narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes center on remapping value after the crash; escalation occurs as density and pattern clarity increase (cards “whisper” by weight, tape becomes lens, realization of migration). The meaningful tightening is the recognition that mapping is relocation, not loss, which forecloses return to profit prophecy and pivots to communal sharing. Costs remain more conceptual than visceral, but they are felt in the renunciatory choices (leaving the spiral, ink fading, tucking away the tape). Pressure stays coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth over comforting erasure—is clear early and escalates as the archive folds into “Möbius strips of regret.” The key tightening is her shift from observing memory to acting (singing) to crack the core, trading preservation for clarity. The descent to the foundation and the pagoda’s destruction make the price unmistakable. Internal and external conflicts interlock without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve hope) is clear early and tightens with the unbound shadow encroaching. The archival discovery forecloses recording‑only as a path, forcing a values trade‑off. Cost is felt—breaking orders, binding not erasing the threat, carrying future vigilance. If anything, the institutional consequence remains implied, not confronted on‑page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: how to act without betraying compassion. Pressure coheres through procedural precision that deepens into ethical clarity (the key tightening: “report the crime yet shield the chameleons”). The price—abandoning naïve goodness for vigilant, regret-laced action—is legible. Limited external push keeps it shy of peak intensity, but the internal escalation is credible and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—return or retain the displaced miracle—tightens from cryptic plant pressure to an irreversible act with visible price. The escalation beat is clear: kitchen divination → balcony ritual → blood and release. The cost (surrendering a long‑standing power and bond) lands and alters options going forward. No antagonist is needed; internal and external pressures interlock effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes cohere around reclaiming/locating unused love, with one meaningful tightening as the letter animates and the rule of storage is repriced. Agency drives the deepening (psychometry → threading → singing → beam at tin), and the final renunciation forecloses a path with cost. Tension is mostly internal and lyric, but it does escalate in texture and consequence. A more immediate counterforce might have sharpened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (freeing caged creativity) is legible early and intensifies as the aurora’s pressure mounts. The meaningful tightening arrives when she reverses the sextant’s gaze onto herself and verbalizes a vow; this forecloses the path of avoidance. Cost is present as a chosen endurance rather than a spectacle, fitting the mode. If anything, the external risk is low, but the internal trade is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—what to do with erased futures/dreams—tightens through the door confrontation to the choice to “cultivate what you discarded.” The reversal (using the archive’s offered spark to unmake/narrow it) is protagonist‑driven and carries legible price. Pressure coheres; the cadence shift after the clock absorbs the spark reweights the field. Stakes could register more bodily risk before the act, but the conceptual cost is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are singular and legible: either preserve certainty or risk the mind’s wild frontier. Pressure escalates via choice points and a deepening instruction (“unravel”) that exacts a visible price (loss of name, identity anchors). The tightening is earned by her agency, culminating in inserting the gear and surrendering the map. The conflict remains largely internal and lyric in register, slightly softening felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes focus on whether the boy can summon and bind unused courage to cross; pressure coheres through the accumulating ritual and stories. The decisive tightening is the requirement to “call it by the name you fear most,” narrowing options to a single vulnerable act. Cost is felt in relinquishing flight and accepting constraint (thread replacing leash). Escalation is quiet but precise under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake—safety via forgetting versus memory with cost—is signaled early and tightens through the bolt’s revelation. The scream below tests his covenant and narrows options, and the bolt’s use forecloses “remaining” with real consequence. Internal and external pressures interweave cleanly into the decisive turn at the gate. No luck‑based resolution; agency drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates when the pellet warms and the rune begins to “pull at the edges of things.” The revelation spreads with consequence, but opposition never pushes back; the resolution feels assured once the rune engages. The tightening is meaningful but low-friction. Effective, not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (“discover why some paths disappear”) is signaled early and deepens through a single decisive intensification at the slick. Escalation coheres: tapping becomes a method that provokes a response, enabling descent to the loom. The cost is primarily risk and renunciation (choosing witness over data), not a hard trade-off against a counterforce, but sufficient at this length. The earned return to vigil reflects a narrowed, clarified path.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover meaning/rekindle the cause—tightens as the hum escalates into coordinates, forcing her to choose a role. The meaningful turn is placing the glasses, then reading and acting on the projection; that narrows options toward stewardship over heroics. Pressure is coherent but gentle; the price is responsibility rather than loss, keeping intensity mid-high rather than peak. No antagonist, but internal and situational pressure interweave adequately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to unseal destiny and alter tradition—is established early and tightens through discovery, psychic contact, and public proposal. The key deepening occurs when Lila feels the embryo’s thoughts, reweighting the choice from taboo‑breaking to collaborative becoming. The elders’ protest provides resistance, though it yields quickly; the price is more conceptual/social than punitive. Physical risk (heat, prying) adds tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around whether Mira can hold grief and breathe; escalation appears as a deepening: somatic markers rise, she works through them, and then reweights the photograph and her stance. The cost (not forgetting; relinquishing magical fix‑seeking) is legible. It’s quiet, but the internal tightening is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retain/reshape self against erasure—tightens when walls “inch inward” and reality fragments. The redesign ritual and choice to descend mark a meaningful deepening with real price (confronting the keeper’s bones, surrendering the old order). Resolution is earned through agency, not coincidence. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens to a charged, costly acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes—find what happened and recover the team—are signaled early, and the pressure tightens from analysis to a portal crossing. However, challenges yield readily: the ink “responds” to her serenity, the drone stabilizes the door, and the chronographer is reached without a hard trade‑off. Escalation is more intellectual than visceral, with no clear loss or foreclosed option. The ending lacks a concrete consequence to crystallize cost.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: the crimson bloom raises risk, forcing the choice to disseminate widely with witnesses. Stakes are singular (truth vs. regime danger) and the turn forecloses safety. Cost is legible (public scandal, alarms, self‑incrimination via act), though physical jeopardy remains mostly atmospheric. Tension scales sentence to scene without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving the dome’s “quiet” against scavengers—is consistently signaled and tightens when the hatch opens. Lila’s agency escalates from caretaking to a deliberate nonviolent gambit, with the pane crack marking price and narrowing options. The risk is palpable though not catastrophic; the piece opts for poise over reversal. A touch more consequence on the intruder beat could have heightened felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible: keep the goddess’s echo at the cost of composure. Escalation tightens from intention to summoning to a bargain that forces a trade-off, culminating in surrender and marked transformation. The cost is unmistakable on the page (heat drained into iron, loss of cool-headedness). Pressure is largely lyric rather than oppositional, but it coheres and deepens credibly under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightened by the journalist’s call and the live clock to 4:09. The decisive turn—choosing proof by contradiction over conventional force—narrows options and exacts an emotional price. Tension scales through the count (4:08 flare, 4:09 burn) and the later reveal of fragments adds credible after‑cost. Pressure could deepen with one more complication testing her method before success.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates coherently: the cry’s recurrence forces increasingly costly tactics. The firmware’s offer to “tether” tightens options, and the throat tattoo is a committed, visible price. Resolution results from her agency, not coincidence; the time fold deepens pressure rather than solves it. Cost persists in the freckle-sized guilt and the dated label.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—learning to meet the hush on its terms—tightens as she chooses chalk over speech, widens the ring, accepts memory dissolution, and then carries the practice outside. The visible price is release of memories and abstention from speech; the payoff is agency redefined as facilitation of silence in a noisy world. Escalation is textural, not reversal‑driven, but it deepens options and cost appropriately for length.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to reconfigure memory toward empathy—tightens when the red tessera is found and placed, leading to a concrete rebuilding choice. Pressure escalates via the decision to “rename” and persist in patching, with Leylah’s line sharpening the moral calculus. Cost is present but primarily conceptual/emotional rather than material. The beat structure coheres under the accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is explicit (“before the garden seals itself at dawn” and the coin’s warning), with one meaningful tightening when the minor chord signals lingering despair and she must escalate to dance and summon echoes. Agency drives the turns: she chooses the hoop, the tree offering, and the dance that transforms ovations into a knit timeline. The price—self-dissolution into dust—lands. The escalation is coherent and cumulative, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—illuminate hidden pathways—tightens when the seam folds and the corridor appears, forcing bolder tactics (painting lines, circling, sigil). Escalation is internally driven and coherent under the accumulative lens. The visible price is commitment to ongoing exposure and a redefinition of skepticism; there’s no external antagonist or sharp loss, so pressure feels exquisitely tuned but gentle. The corridor confrontation functions as the key deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is set early and coherently tightened at the fork and again upon discovering the sleeper. The key turn is Lira’s renunciation: choosing to enable rather than claim authorship, with the price of relinquishing the map. Escalation suits the accumulative lens—density increases and options reweight rather than multiple reversals. Consequences persist (recorder silent, ownership surrendered).

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: convert the echo before dawn or lose it. Escalation is achieved by density and cadence shifts (shivering echo → phrases → light → spindle → her answer), with one meaningful tightening at the choice to press the pearl. The cost is quiet but present: relinquishing a potent, symbolic button and releasing the captured echo. The final scattering of three spares extends consequence rather than deflating it.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—risking vulnerability to repair trust—tightens through the escalating breadcrumb code to a climb and a relational bet. The meaningful turn is the decision to ignite the violet and then to offer the pillbox (trust before proof). Prices are primarily emotional and conceptual rather than physical, but they’re felt. Slightly soft external pressure keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—surrendering distilled grief before the clock runs out—is legible early via the no-coin ask and palimpsest promises. Escalation tightens as rain ticks faster and the realization that “the essence she seeks is mine” forces the trade. The visible price (his daughter’s last smile) narrows options and earns the ending. Quiet but decisive deepening, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake tightens through a clear deepening: each step forces a weighted choice (blooming vs. char), culminating in the well and lantern’s transformation. Pressure escalates via density and cadence (thrum → ringing → unfolding petals), not antagonism, fitting the chosen lens. The price is subtle but present in the tradeoff of attention and in leaving the oasis while the wasteland persists. A sharper on‑page loss could have amplified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (revive the rose/keep light alive) is signaled early and tightened by the “last petal” clock. Escalation arises through cumulative response—first vibration, then sap bead, then multiple canes, then buds—with Mira’s agency (humming/aligning) at each step. The visible price is chiefly endurance and risk of smothering the “match,” not a hard loss. Still, the cadence shift to dawn provides a meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake (translate isolation into independence by taking the songs below) is signaled early and deepens through the ritual and the “two futures” hinge. The meaningful tightening forecloses a live option (becoming a memory in the library) and reframes cost. Pressure is internal but coherent, with the circle’s hum and script functioning as catalyzing force. Slight absence of external counterpressure keeps it shy of maximal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten when Elian’s sculpture demands a gifted sliver, forcing Arin to surrender her talisman. The escalation is inward but concrete, culminating in a visible price and a new stasis. Pressure coheres; no antagonist needed. The conflict is elegant rather than harrowing, but the trade‑off is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are signaled early (community cohesion vs. manipulation) and escalate when the tricksters layer a “colder” counter‑song. The mirror tactic narrows options and forces a trade‑off under risk (amplitude drift, hardware stress). The on‑page reversal is earned by her decision, not coincidence. The cost is felt if not catastrophic, keeping it just shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover the key despite claustrophobia—is signaled and tightened when retreat seals and gravity destabilizes. Escalation arises from Elara’s choices (engaging the organ, fusing the compass) rather than luck, and each turn narrows options. The visible price is letting the ghost go and risking entrapment to act. Pressure remains coherent through the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres: from solitary setup to the woman’s arrival, to the charged act of uniting ribbons and transforming voids into an eye, to authorities converging. The dominant stake—lancing silence/animating empathy in cold cases—tightens when Elias chooses offering over interrogation. The price is felt but understated; escalation is more tonal/depth than overt hazard. Still, the arrival of search dogs marks a tangible narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused: can exile be reversed without unacceptable cost. Escalation coheres—each stanza intensifies pressure, culminating in the mirror’s exchange question that narrows options to a sacrifice. The cost is present (Lila’s foreclosed rescue of herself; taking on sea‑etched age/role), though the “who goes adrift” mechanic remains slightly soft. Agency drives the turns rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transmuting “never” into possibility—tightens through agency: playing becomes path‑making, then bridge‑forging. The decisive fusion of glass and the hitchhiker’s fade mark a felt price. Pressure escalates coherently under the accumulative lens; coincidence (mysterious rules) complicates but does not resolve. A brief beat of doubt would sharpen the trade‑off at entry.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are focused: preserve/redefine the site before demolition. Pressure tightens when Mara tries to dissuade and the drone map reveals a circling route, prompting the boundary‑marking tactic and the final burn. The cost is legible (sacrifice of money, refusal to leave; risk vs. data center razing). Resolution stems from their agency, though the drones’ withdrawal skirts ease.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the inscriptions to share/heal burdens—is pressured by the requirement of witness and culminates in the temple’s demand for a sacrifice. The escalation is a clean deepening: witnessing enables naming, which stabilizes stars, which opens the temple, which demands cost. Agency drives each step, and the price (surrendered guilt/fear) is legible. Slight smoothness (no snag or reversal tests their resolve) tempers peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early: admit the truth or remain cursed and alone. Pressure coheres and tightens when she commits to planting the seed, then doubles down by feeding it blood, foreclosing the path of continued denial. The visible price is unmistakable (thorns, public confession) and the turn earns the conjurer’s return. Tension threads sentence‑ to scene‑level without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (restore balance without hoarding light) tightens under the eclipse “mouth closing.” The key turn is Lyra choosing to bind her scars to the seed, paying with memories. Pressure remains coherent and grows; consequence is visible (mirrors tremble, scars reconfigure). A single, well-scaled trade-off suits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—repair through barter—is clear and tightens when Ardan warns she’s ensnaring the living, forcing her to offer her own futures. Escalation is measured but decisive: pledge, graft, shared pinning ritual. The price is unmistakable (surrendered tomorrows) and alters options. Pressure remains coherent without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep insulating or risk pain—tightens through a cadence shift when facts “fall away.” The choice to give the cloth away forecloses a path (continued hiding) with emotional cost and a specific next step (find the sister). Escalation is internal but coherent and suffices at this length. External pressure is light, keeping it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—reestablishing the bridge to understand transition—and tightens via the seed’s activation and the consent test. The reversal is modest but decisive: she shifts from extraction to conversation, then renounces the fruit and data‑driven payoff. Cost is legible (status and empirical capital) even in a quiet frame. A single gentle deepening rather than multiple turns, but it’s sufficient and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes concentrate on safeguarding wonder through a single night’s work; escalation arrives with the moon’s zenith and returning tide that forces acceleration. The bead‑forging and the transfer to the lotus narrow options toward an earned stasis. Absence of overt antagonism keeps tension gentle, but the live environmental clock supplies sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres around whether survival requires severance versus connection, tightened by each confession that warms and weaponizes the pearl. The escalation is a density increase consistent with the lens, culminating in a felt price: relinquishing the safety of sealedness. Stakes remain singular and legible; no antagonist needed. A small beat of resistance before the final placement might have sharpened cost even more.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightens through an image‑driven deepening: graffiti prompts a test, confession through the instrument triggers the bell’s chime, the map’s tearing/scarring forecloses an option. The price is legible: relinquishing the old map/identity and accepting the cost of what was withheld. Pressure is internal yet coherent and grows toward the exit refusal. No extraneous reversals; the single meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—gain access to and then decide what to do with the lexicon—tightens through the payment demand and the con man’s proposed trade. The reversal (from take to release) carries a clear price and reweights the goal. Agency drives turns: opening the crimson letter sets the rule, pressing watch to watermark unlocks the lullaby, opening the ash‑gray letter enables the trade, speaking the lullaby resolves the pressure. Stakes remain intimate but palpable, with no convenient rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres: the empire’s dawn deadline and audible drums tighten the window while Lira tests signals and commits. The meaningful turn arrives when she reframes “perforated destiny” as permeability and acts—setting and then bowing the violin to seed rebellion. External antagonism remains offstage, but the internal vs. external stakes integrate and foreclose the imperial path. The cost is clear though bloodless; still, escalation feels earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (consolidate sparks vs. lose them to oblivion) is signaled early and tightens at the hesitation beat. The decisive infusion forecloses a path (keeping the chips) with visible price. Pressure escalates in a single, sufficient intensification (the pane brightening to collapse). If anything, external counterpressure is minimal, but internal stakes carry it.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reconfiguring forgiveness into contentment through tending—tightens via the ghost’s charge and the decisive sacrifice. The external crisis (dying grove) threads the internal one and culminates in an irreversible act that forecloses a path (keeping the hairpin as relic) for a costlier one (lifetime caretaking). Pressure remains coherent and grows, if gently, under the chosen lens. A touch more frictive resistance from the sister might have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—betray or spare—tightens through the chime’s unresolved chord, then flips into a costly compromise. The mirror transfer creates a small reversal: judgment outsourced to the smuggler’s self‑recognition, producing compliance without command. Prices are named and felt (both sides angered, heavier cloak). Escalation is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how and when to reveal—tightens through the decision to wait until the last ring reaches shore, then release the stone. The pressure is coherent and escalates in cadence rather than confrontation, appropriate to the chosen lens. The price (foreclosing immediacy, embracing a life of progressive disappearance) is legible. Quiet but consequential escalation avoids static lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure escalates through pattern density: reading birds → reading herself → final renunciation. The dominant stake (mastering stillness) tightens into a single irreversible choice with visible cost: self‑translation into a tower. Agency is internal but decisive and legible; the flock freezing provides a clear turning point. Stakes are felt though largely conceptual rather than peril‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to cling to exceptionalism or surrender to the ordinary—tightens through concrete acts: unstrapping, stepping into mist, releasing the keystone, planting the drop. Escalation is internal but coherent; the bridge descent and garden threshold deepen the choice rather than reset it. The cost of renunciation is felt and permanent in this frame. Lack of an external counterforce keeps tension from cresting higher.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular and legible (“discover the color of sound before the last lantern burned out”), with one meaningful escalatory turn at the phonograph. The time pressure and the tide create a coherent narrowing without overt antagonist. The cost—releasing the key, ending the quest’s refuge—reads on the page. Pressure is more elegiac than sharp, but it still tightens in step with the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (alignment with purpose before total dark) is signaled early and coherently escalates via pattern shifts (coin adjustments → voice confirmation → telescope focus → newborn light). The pressure clarifies rather than multiplies, appropriate to the accumulative lens. The price—self‑dissolution—arrives as a committed choice, closing other paths. No luck‑based resolution; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is internal but legible: transform fear through naming and pay with memory. Pressure tightens as light exhausts and names carve into him; the atlas bleaching visually marks cost. The final vow is an active stance with consequence, not a soft reset. Slightly low on overt external pressure, but the accumulative intensification works.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are clear early (“before the oceans climb back into the stars”) and pressure coheres through ritual attempts whose failure/success tracks to his psyche (crack widens with doubt). A tightening beat arrives when he must name the bosun and use his own blood/hair—foreclosing denial and paying a price. The tempo relies on a felt clock (last fish, droplets ascending) rather than a ticking deadline, but it’s sufficient at this length. Resolution is protagonist‑driven, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (break silence vs. preserve comfort) is signaled early and tightens at the mirror, where the private admission precedes public risk. The decisive choice forecloses a long‑held path of secrecy with visible social and internal cost. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the densest beat is the confession, followed by the public weaving of stories that tests commitment. The wind chime’s reprise provides a subtle but clear release valve after real risk.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible from the outset; pressure tightens as the crystal sings, the flock spirals, and memories bloom, culminating in a costed acceptance. Agency drives the escalation—she shifts methods and commits physically to the transformation. Stakes are intimate but consequential, with a felt loss/translation. Slightly smooth path to realization prevents a higher spike.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early (another flyer could die; trust could shatter). Escalation deepens when Zev shifts from fixing a buckle to revising the entire release sequence—narrowing options under subtle atmospheric pressures. The price is endurance and recommitment under fatigue; while low on overt reversal, the tightening is credible for this length and mode. Stakes remain focused and coherent through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—possession vs shared feeling—tightens when Kael opens the jar, making surrender the only non‑violent path. The reversal (from blade to kneeling) is earned by acknowledging mutual numbness; cost is relinquishing claims and re‑sensitizing. Pressure coheres under the situational lens; the world’s lurches complicate but don’t resolve. Slight softness: external mechanism (scroll) assists resolution but is unlocked by their choice.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control vs evolution—is clear and escalates: secret seed influence, guests’ gauntlet, eruption, and the key’s dissolution. The decisive tightening is Mara choosing to lose proprietorship to keep innovation uncaged. Pressure is coherent and grows from her agency rather than coincidence resolving the conflict. The cost is explicit and enduring (role surrendered; the house now chooses riddles).

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates through deliberate intensifications (three pulls, first movement, the lullaby fold, idle hush, second movement). The tightening choice—letting the house “laugh at its own sorrow” before resuming—recasts tactics and narrows options. Costs are emotional and material (fuel depletion, relinquishing control to the house’s voice). Stakes stay coherent without requiring an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—guarding the boundary—tightens via the pendant’s oscillations and the child‑absence’s test. The meaningful turn is the echo‑key choice that reconfigures the pendant, narrowing options from defensive force to porous welcome. Consequence is felt in entrusting the pendant to the reformed acolyte, a risk-laden shift in method. Pressure is primarily conceptual and textural but coherent and escalating under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: transform calcified dogma via creative destruction. Escalation is coherent through increasingly dear approximations (breath → ink → shroud thread → ashes → blood → surrender of memory), with each move narrowing options and raising cost. The key tightening is his self‑wound and the renunciation of obedience, which unlocks the lift. Resolution follows from his agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the beginning to reconfigure a loss—is clear and tightens as hush density builds toward contact. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial, with one decisive intensification at the merge and the city “exhaling.” Agency drives the turn, but resistance is minimal; no options are meaningfully foreclosed beyond a gentle renunciation of old beliefs. The felt price is modest but present in the acceptance of a new stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reuniting scattered timelines to bring commuters safe—is legible and tightened through a decisive act (aligning the hourglass and braiding the radio signals). Escalation reads as deepening density rather than multiple reversals, fitting the lens. Agency drives the resolution; coincidence initiates but does not solve. The on‑page price is quieter (ongoing burden and isolation) but it charges the end.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: map/bridge connection without being consumed; escalation rises as patterns “erupt,” lullaby curdles, corridors loop, narrowing options. The decisive tightening is realizing the gallery is a living mind that’s assimilating her, forcing the trade‑off between escape and becoming the seam. The price is explicit and lasting (selfhood and freedom). No wasted beats; each attempt generates a new complication that pushes toward renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—risking self and status to learn a new navigation—tightens from contemplation to commitment (pressing the link, leaving watchers, crossing the lip, diving). Escalation is a cadence deepening rather than adversarial; the taboo and grief provide coherent pressure. A sharper on‑page resistance could heighten price, but the internal/external braid suffices at this length. The ending stance crystallizes into teaching, an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure builds as more dead arrive, sharpening the responsibility to translate and testify. The tightening is a density increase under the chosen lens, peaking when Mara turns pulses into syllables and must answer multiple claims. Stakes remain intimate rather than perilous, but the vow forecloses the option to remain a mere observer. The cost is subtle yet legible in the final burdened image.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible: move through the facility within a tide’s window to restore broken connections while managing panic. Escalation reads as density intensification—thresholds, phase doorway, sing-to-repair—culminating in a choice to assume an ongoing duty as the structure collapses. The price is an open-ended commitment under recurring fear and a vanishing safe haven. Minor drag: the central repair faces little counterpressure beyond mood, reducing the bite of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (integrate a corrupted identity or remain a ghost) is signaled early and tightens through the heartbeat‑for‑action trade. The decisive deepening—choosing to “defragment” by tracing the ink and then stepping into the vortex—narrows options and exacts a price. Internal and external pressures interweave without an antagonist. Consequences reconfigure the world’s stance toward the narrator (the corrected printout) without feeling costless.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve a dying language’s texture) is clear, with a live clock (“die with the sunset,” “Tonight the last speaker was herself”). Escalation arrives as density: from tactile phonemes to aerial grammar culminating in a single bird/sentence and the final syllable. The price is legible—the language’s death and her loss of ancestral resonance—even as she preserves its pattern. It’s a quiet conflict without reversals, but the tightening cadence and narrowing options read earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieving/redefining Orion and the missing—tightens through one meaningful deepening as Vale chooses to enact the fusion and then to leave with a charged mission. Pressure escalates coherently via pattern intensification (sound → metamorphosis → cosmic reweighting). The cost and narrowing of options are evident, though external antagonism is minimal. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve outcomes.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates: free the orchard before statues shatter the span. The tower of guardians and “seconds” beat is a concrete tightening that narrows options. Resolution is the protagonist’s risky conversion of fear into a single soft note, paying with her talisman. Costs and consequences carry forward in the reconfigured orchard and lost shell.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (restoring trust across a border) are legible early and deepen when Mercy departs with the postcard and returns with the soldier’s button. Escalation is quiet but marked: from a single spark for Lila to a hall of names to the synchronized “two heartbeats.” The price is endurance and risk, implied by clandestine routes and censors. Lack of overt opposition keeps pressure soft but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates via density and cadence: finding the oasis, first song, halo blooming, shard‑to‑life conversions, then the decisive insertion into the carousel. The dominant stake (recasting silence) tightens as singing proves both tool and stance. Costs and reversals are gentle—no resistant force answers him—yet the renunciation at the climax reads as a real narrowing. The accumulative build earns the forward motion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres and deepens: the geometry’s bending narrows options, the scarf’s tug compels a test, and the touch triggers a library‑wide shift. The dominant stake (finding the living place of stories) is established and meaningfully tightened. The price—bearing awakened voices and altered solitude—is felt but gentle, keeping tension elegant rather than harrowing. No antagonistic force, but the escalation cadence is clean and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (capture/vitalize the dream), with a tightening when the child gains flesh but not eyes, creating a new obstacle. The decisive turn is her choice to offer the palette and not follow—an earned trade that costs her shadow and tool. Pressure builds by density and cadence rather than reversals, fitting the chosen lens. Stakes stay intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (free the idea) is clear early; escalation occurs through the disorientation and threading that loosens bars of fear, culminating in the riot’s memory and the gate’s dissolution. Pressure coheres but remains mostly internal and ritualized, with few setbacks or trade-offs. The release reweights the world (constellations return), yet the price is gentle rather than exacting. Still, the deepening via Aelira’s past crisps the stakes at the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear and intensifies: safe memory flashes escalate to confronting the dark shard, then transgressive action (lifting the mushroom) and vulnerable cost (singing the near-forgotten lullaby). The tightening forecloses paths—she must accept a reconfigured return rather than pristine restoration. The price is legible and carried into the ending’s cadence. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres through the ledger economy.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reversing exile—tightens via the shadow’s resistance, the descent, and the high‑leverage ultimatum at the warm cup. The drinking decision functions as the essential narrowing, with the explicit price of “we both remain ghosts.” Internal and external threads braid cleanly without bloat. Pressure stays coherent and escalates under the ritual logic.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are singular and legible: bind two fraying realms or lose wonder. Escalation deepens via the toll (“hands began to silver,” “breath grew thin”), narrowing options toward sacrifice. The tightening is driven by Arin’s agency and craft, not coincidence. One clean intensification suffices at this length, though a sharper micro‑reversal could have amplified tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are legible early (exhume names before forgetting’s “tide”), and pressure escalates through accumulation rather than contest. The decisive intensification is the gathered hush condensed to a cloud and Lira’s choice to pierce it. The process reads smooth—little resistance or risk—yet the burdened endurance and teaching beat with the fisherman provide felt cost. Closure arises from her deliberate act, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: will she render what the land refuses to be mapped. Escalation is a density increase: shadow growth across decades, cold deepening, and the map’s adhesion—culminating in a committed act and revaluation. The price is conceptual and aesthetic rather than perilous, which fits the lens but slightly softens bite. Still, the decisive overlay moment narrows options and compels the renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate/understand vs. let go—tightens toward a clear renunciation. The meaningful turn arrives with opening the globe and the decision to leave it, which forecloses a path (bringing proof up). Cost is legible and thematically fused. Pressure escalates coherently under the accumulative lens without needing multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: speak the unsaid before the thunder arrives. Escalation deepens via ritual (pressing, painting, door‑passage) to the imperative “Sing now,” which forecloses further deferral. The price—exposure and irreversible confession—charges the act of singing. The tightening is clear and protagonist‑driven under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early (save or burn) and escalates via the ticking ascent and decryption revelations. The key tightening occurs when Lina chooses method (prism light/goggles) and commits to a public, irreversible gesture on the roof. Cost is legible (disobeyed order under imminent fleet), though resistance is internal and atmospheric rather than contested on the page. Tension holds, if quietly.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure accrues via recognition beats (mentor’s breath in cumulus → her face in droplets), culminating in finishing the atlas and reorienting her professional drive. The dominant stake is internal and coherent, though external hazard from the drift never meaningfully tightens her options. The decisive turn is more of a deepening than a reversal, but it credibly narrows her stance. Felt cost remains primarily conceptual/emotional rather than situational.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early and coherently tightens as demolition advances. Agency drives escalation through the coin’s use and the embossing choice; cost arrives as the irrevocable collapse of the library. The pattern deepens (faces within stars; guild recast as nebulae), yielding a single meaningful cadence shift. Pressure remains focused without busy reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—pursuit of discovery versus caution—tightens through the puzzle’s materialization and the decisive plotting of the island. Escalation is protagonist-driven at each step, with a clean deepening when birds and book align to steer the ship. The legible price (defiance of orders, endangering the mission) remains mostly implied, keeping the pressure strong but not searing. No antagonist needed; internal vs. external pressure interweave effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—mend time at a personal price—is signaled early and tightens via the cracked mirror beat. The decisive escalation comes with inserting the petrified tear and accepting fusion with the mechanism. Pressure is coherent but largely ritual-smooth; a touch more resistance or threat would heighten jeopardy. The visible price at the end grounds the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (saving the orchard by anchoring the nebula) is clear early and tightens with “before the final crack.” Agency is credible: Kiran proposes the net, the group adapts (tensions, knots, rhythm), and Luma pays the price. Escalation is mostly linear but effective; fatigue and fear deepen pressure without a hard reversal. The resolution emerges from chosen collaboration, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—soothing a dying world without erasing it—is legible and sharpened by the mirror‑revealed costs. The main tightening is her decision to touch the pane and sing despite the losses, which forecloses her prior path. Consequences register (world exhales; her body pays—pane into bloodstream). Escalation is more deepening than reversal but sufficient for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—guide the hikers before frost—tightens through assembling the corridor, negotiating with the birds, and racing the clock. The cost of success is explicit: sacrificing the seasonal nut and expelling her inheritance. Tension coheres sentence to sentence, with one clean deepening rather than multiple reversals. A slightly sharper on‑page risk of failure at the crossing would heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (how to atone) is signaled early and tightens as she commits to a concrete, irreversible act. The flashback pressures the present, and the fusion of shell to stone forecloses the path of erasure. Cost is legible in leaving the last physical relic and choosing service over private penance. Stakes escalate subtly but credibly for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—find where stories begin to serve parole—tightens through the imperative “forgive,” forcing a trade: control for service. The decisive actions (incision, naming absences, planting the seed) escalate pressure within the accumulative pattern. Cost is legible in the surrender of the vendor identity. Stakes remain internal but coherent and sharpened rather than static.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transmuting stored remorse without being consumed—tightens when Lira realizes she must “subsume it completely.” The escalation is clean and character‑driven: tasting the broth risks overwhelm and forces endurance as agency. The price is palpable (embodied near‑drowning) and the choice narrows options toward a single costly path. Resolution follows credibly from that act.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (transform isolation into connection) is clear and deepens through concrete steps: placing the weight, polyphonic response, structural repair, and speaker installation. The meaningful tightening arrives when Sora presses the weight into the silos’ rusted seam, after which the structures “accept” confession and change. Pressure is coherent under the textural lens but largely unopposed; the path contains little risk or sacrifice beyond effort. Consequences carry forward into the dawn chorus convincingly.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—whether she can rewire and incarnate abandoned dreams—intensifies as she chooses surrender over force, allowing entangled memories to restructure her. The physical price (glass biting skin) and identity cost are present but not pressured by external opposition. Escalation reads as a density increase and synchronization, consistent with the lens, though options don’t visibly narrow beyond the single turn. Earned but not crushing.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (secure the “forgotten combinations” and seed vigilance before the hour ends) escalates via the dwindling clock and the threshold trying to eject her. The meaningful tightening occurs when she must plant just one seed and withdraw; options narrow credibly. Agency drives the peak beats (violet choice, planting, folding the dragon). Stakes skew conceptual rather than visceral, but they read under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates: mapping chords lacks a heart until she commits to the spiral, deepening pressure. The “entering the fracture” turn narrows options and demands a price. Resolution flows from her agency (exhaling, matching pitches) rather than coincidence. Quiet tension operates at beat and sentence levels without false intensifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (navigate the nexus/advance to the next phase by extracting meaning from loss) tightens through the keeper’s emergence and the node placement. Escalation is a deepening: pattern‑correlation intensifies to a single charged act. The cost is primarily internal—renunciation of a return to court—so the pressure reads quieter but coherent under the chosen lens. No reversal, but one solid tightening carries the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—recover the feared silence without violence—is clear, and pressure coheres through the methodical tuning sequence. The tightening arrives when the clasp remembers and the thumbprint forces her to face the near‑violence. However, escalation lacks a real reversal; the process rarely threatens to fail or exact more than interior cost. Still, agency drives the turn and forecloses the path of force.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—opening the seed—tightens through the ritual’s accumulation and the live clock (hourglass; seven nights; tide reversal). The meaningful turn is the packet’s tremble and seam, leading to a charged bloom. Pressure is gentle, with minimal jeopardy or hard trade‑offs; still, agency drives the escalation. Felt price is time/attention and a torn petal (offering) rather than a sharper loss.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (discover source and act before gravity returns) is established early, and pressure tightens as she is pulled toward the vortex with a live clock. The decisive escalation is entering the arch and committing the final arrow tip, which removes the option to play safe. Costs are primarily risk‑based rather than losses, but they’re present and felt in the narrowing corridor and timing squeeze. Resolution emerges from her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (prevent/contain the sphere and restore the town) is signaled early and escalates coherently. The tightening beat—the bulb bursts and ribbon snaps—forces a high‑risk, timed decision that narrows options to one precise act. Internal aim (foresight) directly informs the external tactic under pressure. Costs (silence deepening, risk of expansion, relinquished rest) are felt, not merely stated.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates via density and deepening rather than reversals: the transfer of hush, the stone’s response, then the self-emptying at the heart. The price—spending her hoarded silence—tightens stakes and forecloses ease afterward. Still, conflict is largely internal and sacramental; the stone never truly resists her, keeping stakes elegant but low-friction. The sculptor’s presence underscores consequence rather than forcing a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres and deepens as she pivots from compass to spiral, the air densifies, and the fracture widens—one meaningful tightening consistent with the chosen lens. Stakes are internal but legible, culminating in a renunciation that forecloses the old tactic of sealing. The cost is primarily conceptual and identity‑based rather than visceral, keeping the ceiling just below the highest band. The choice to descend only after reconfiguring the frame is a clear, earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to finalize the broadside/experiment before time erases the sky—tightens as stars wink out and emotion escapes containment. The key escalation is her choice to reverse the transposition, which incurs visible loss and forecloses the original path. Internal and external pressures interweave coherently. Stakes remain intimate but consequential, scaled well to the form.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—deliver before dawn vs. succumbing to the pendant’s social pull—is signaled and tightened at the cliff reveal. Escalation is subtle but coherent under the accumulative lens; the reveal that Rell crossed into myth reweights the mission. The price is primarily identity/time rather than physical peril, which keeps tension quiet but credible. The ending choice forecloses the courier path.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (prove the premise without being consumed) tightens when the communion demands symmetry and physically holds her. The price—forced self‑exposure and surrendering the prism—is legible and reweights the ending. Escalation is internal and textural but coherent under the chosen lens. Minor softness: no additional external counter‑pressure tests her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear early and deepens: failed couriers/pigeons → bead discovery → puzzle solution → irrevocable send. A meaningful tightening occurs when she trades the thimble and later inserts the bead, foreclosing future hearing in exchange for sending. Cost is explicit and carried forward. The escalation is gentle rather than harrowing, but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: save the orchards without erasing vital grief. The decisive tightening is the barter choice, with visible cost and a knowledge shift (“absence immediately” vs. later realization). The apparent solution births a new complication—community barters carry cumulative loss—keeping tension alive in the closing movement. Agency drives every turn; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes (learn and release the withheld truth) are signaled early and tighten decisively at the console revelation. The major turn is Lira choosing not to reenter the cycle but to seal the shard, paying a price in foreclosed possibilities. Tension is quiet but coherent; internal and external pressures interweave. A touch more on-the-page resistance before the final act could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving safety—tightens when the haunting demands more than his established stone grammar. The escalation is quiet but real: from routine signaling to internalizing and decanting an ache into a flask, a choice with ongoing cost. No reversals per se, but the widow’s intervention reweights options and compels a deeper commitment. The lack of external peril (no active storm) caps intensity but suits the piece’s mode.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is to forge a new dawn; pressure tightens through the accidental fracture (a new constraint), the multiplied futures, and the search for the black sun’s angle, culminating in cracking the lens. Costs are concrete (ruined lens/lighthouse, surrender of human form). Escalation is largely externalized through environment and method rather than internal doubt, but agency drives every turn. The tightening is meaningful and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is a precise density increase: the sun trail appears, a second trail beckons, descent to the pool, then the wing’s exhaustion. The dominant stake—whether Kael will remain guarded or become permeable—is tightened by the compass‑like wing that points “toward the stories that cut deepest.” The cost is paid in surrender and the wing’s loss, with a clear reweighting at the end. Slight limitation: external hazard is minimal, so pressure remains mostly inner and aesthetic.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reconfiguring grief via the sextant) is clear and tightens as moonlight activates healing. Escalation is tonal/density-based rather than obstacle-driven, fitting the chosen lens. However, pressure is gentle; few options close or exact a price beyond relinquishing the desire to “fix back” versus “transform.” The end is earned but not hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (rekindling a dying realm) is signaled early and tightened as the night actively unravels her song. She adapts: from general singing to naming a precise peach, then to blossom-swaddling, then to the final tapestry. Cost is legible in her fraying voice and the relinquishment of personal memory. Opposition remains atmospheric rather than agentive, but pressure still coheres and deepens effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes cohere around whether she will continue self‑dissolving compassion or adopt a boundary‑honoring stance. Escalation is a deepening: candles shorten, she enacts “staying while leaving,” faces her younger self, and confronts the misdelivery paradox. The visible price is internal but legible: she refuses a familiar path when the map appears. Pressure remains coherent without requiring an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to bear and transform loss—tightens from witnessing to acting through guerrilla gardening. The decision to plant at the bakery site forecloses pure memorialization in favor of risky renewal, with the cost named. Escalation is quiet but decisive under the accumulative lens. A subtle cadence shift at the planting and “treaty with time” clarifies consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten when Elara recognizes her own vow and realizes the library’s purpose, forcing a renunciation of her role. The price—letting the institution (and her identity) dissolve—reads on the page. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial, yet coherent and decisive under the chosen lens. A small beat of resistance before the release could have magnified tension.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early (capture the sound to free her father), and escalation tightens through the repeated “false starts” until Roe’s photo forces a harder calculus. Lila’s decision forecloses a path with cost, not luck. Tension threads sentence‑level (near‑noises) to story‑level (deadline). The single deepening is sufficient at this length and lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens when Mara states the potential flood if rain wins. The protagonists choose convergence in time with the election, paying with loss of the ring and surrender of the aurora—costs that charge the ending. Escalation is more deepening than combative, but the cadence shift at the ritual provides the necessary turn. A small increase in resistance or risk in the act itself could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres around the dominant stake (accept/renounce calling) and tightens through discoveries that force stance crystallization. The key deepening is the reconception of the combination as “moments,” turning memory into mechanism and committing her to repair. Cost shows in choosing irrevocable repair and wearing the lock. Stakes are intimate but scaled correctly for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering and returning honest speech, especially the brother’s) is clear early; pressure tightens with the archive’s rule that lies dissipate—forcing her to speak at cost. A meaningful turn occurs when she rereads the map and discovers the “return” path, shifting her from seeking to bearing responsibility. External obstacles are minimal; stakes lean internal but remain legible and paid.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates via pattern-deepening: construction → activation → sphere → offering → capture. The trade of bronze petals for the sphere’s acceptance is a true tightening with cost; the fragment’s dissolution is another. Tension operates through quiet agency rather than antagonism and works for this mode. The clipped last line blunts the peak cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: resolve inner static while preventing destruction of the dome. The tightening turn—choosing containment over evacuation—forecloses an easier path and demands sacrifice. The ritual walk with the flame escalates coherently to the centered compass ignition, and cost is legible in relinquishing and transforming personal relics. External pressure (countdown to breach) integrates with the internal calculus.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—unsealing the community’s grief—tightens from rumor to whisper to curfew-clock intrusion, culminating in an earned act. The sirens provide a clear escalation, and Mira chooses to proceed despite the risk. The opening itself happens swiftly once she commits; minimal pushback slightly softens cost and suspense. Still, internal/external strands braid convincingly toward the release and reading.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around the timed, bodily decoding and the necessity to exit with the shard; the spider’s crossing is a clean tightening beat. The resolution stems from agency (dance‑cipher, choice to jam the lock), with a visible foreclosure. Escalation is lyric rather than muscular, so danger feels aestheticized rather than acute. Still, the cadence turn at click → fuse → leave lands with weight.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (retrieve/understand lost memories) is signaled early and tightens when the chamber is recognized as a sieve, forcing a deeper commitment (prying up tile, descending). The coffee‑grounds revelation meaningfully deepens pressure and changes options; the flowers become an active method rather than a symbol. The felt price is subtle—risk of destabilizing or re‑living pain rather than a visible loss—so the escalation reads more lyrical than combative. Still, the progression narrows paths and culminates in a decisive tasting that cannot be unwound.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates as the prophecy resists (sharper glyphs, voiced floods). A meaningful tightening occurs when she hesitates and alters method from cage to ear. The on‑page cost is more ethical than visceral, so the pressure feels refined rather than acute. Still, agency drives the turn and the resolution is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether the narrator will accept being “spoken through”—tightens from polite visits to ritual interrogation to bodily marking. The decisive deepening occurs when the widow brands the narrator, foreclosing refusal. Pressure is internal/existential, but escalates coherently under the accumulative lens. The mutual-interrogation turn reframes agency without deflating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (archive before dawn) are signaled early and tighten with the shell’s warning and the star’s fade. Agency drives escalation: she matches and quickens her heartbeat, accepts the price, and removes the shell, triggering collapse. Cost is unmistakable—the garden dissolves and the mother’s voice quiets—even as meaning is carried forward. The pressure remains coherent without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is personal absolution through an on‑page undoing of harm; pressure tightens as ink lifts, blood is offered, and the key activates. The decisive act forecloses the forger path (she leaves the thorn) and exacts a price in identity and memory. The escalation is singular but sufficient at this length. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential without inflation beyond the scene’s bandwidth.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (what to do with the echoes after learning their source) tightens meaningfully when the second singer arrives with the matching shell and offers the possibility to “silence the song.” The choice forecloses a live option; consequences (ongoing sorrow, stranger’s dissolution) are on the page. Pressure accrues coherently under the accumulative lens rather than through reversals, and the internal/external interweave in the peak beat. Stakes remain intimate yet consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (salvage purity vs. confronting wreck-truth) are signaled early and deepen as the globe “sweats” and the sea rises—an effective pressure build for this lens. The key tightening is Nadia’s choice to ask the dead and then to extract only the snow, accepting the cost of what remains unfixable. Cost is emotional rather than tactical, but it is legible in the relinquishment of the globe and the carrying of the locket. A touch more friction or risk in the act itself could sharpen escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure is mostly interior and ceremonial; the lone hard turn is the guard’s arrival with a lowered spear, which quickly resolves into witnessing. The tightening is a deepening of the pattern motif rather than a narrowing of options, and costs remain primarily symbolic. The handoff of the whisk is the clearest agency with price, but the stakes never truly bite. The accumulative build is graceful but soft in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether to expose or bury memory; stakes escalate with the satchel confession and the father’s handwriting. The Apple’s faces intensify the ethical calculus, narrowing options to a meaningful trade‑off. The final renunciation exacts a visible conceptual and moral price. A hair more external pressure (e.g., threat of reprisal manifesting on the page) could have sharpened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: cryptic numbers → chord ladder → congregation → seven strikes → silhouette ingestion. Stakes escalate from private vigil to communal transformation. Cost is felt but more atmospheric than explicit (rain “soldering” skin, iron/lilac ingestion, a hard dawn ahead). Agency is present but partly ceded to storm mechanics, fitting the chosen lens yet slightly softens the price line.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translating silence across generations—tightens through the ritual’s progression and the decisive release. The key deepening is the ballerina’s turn and the sentence the chorus forms, which reweights what he’s doing from private solace to communal bequeathal. Cost is internal and conceptual, not adversarial, yet it’s legible in renunciation and the spring “unwinding like a life.” Pressure is coherent for a lyric piece, though not combative.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are singular and clear: prevent the sea’s grief from drowning every throat. Pressure tightens through ritual sequencing and the surrender of the key, culminating in a successful but not facile transformation. Still, the path is smooth—no real reversal or hard trade‑off beyond the key’s sacrifice—so tension crests more as intensification than crisis. The visible cost helps the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—transforming communal panic into patient action—is signaled early and tightens as Elara commits to the ice and convenes the town for listening. The key intensification is the on‑ice vigil: groan → crack geometry → surfacing rails; fear flickers, and her stance crystallizes. The price is mainly reputational/social risk and physical hazard, not an acute loss, so stakes read profound but cushioned. Agency drives the turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve it.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten from disciplined observation to personal revelation to public stance; the discovery sequence forecloses the “accident” path. The cost is felt (accepting the father’s chosen sacrifice, risking professional friction with Kellerman) and the choice is active (leave lantern, redefine the report). Escalation is primarily knowledge/deepening, but the cadence shift at the journal and final flare provides momentum. A clearer on‑page consequence beyond implied career risk could have heightened pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (can action redeem harm?) tightens from intention to test: finishing the heart to risk Elias’s rejection. The chapel beat provides a credible pressure point and a small but meaningful reversal (Elias reaches for Rowan). The price is emotional exposure and the sacrifice of the heart; escalation is delicate but sufficient at this length. Slightly genteel pressure may leave some readers wanting a harder edge.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (coaxing the unheard bell) is clear and tightens when the anchor chain dissolves and “time… snapped taut.” Agency escalates pressure: Ludo converts patterns to sound, risks flight, and commits the arrow tip to the pour, culminating in the quiet strike. Prices are legible (loss of the arrow’s history, pain, irreversible casting) and alter options. Quiet resolution feels earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake (rescue-preserve the erased) tightens through pattern recognition → discovery → protocol breach → counter-forgery under a ticking clock. The lie and the data transfer foreclose her compliant path; the demolition crew’s arrival sharpens the cost. Pressure escalates coherently without deus ex machina. The silhouette flicker offers a brief victory tempered by loss, maintaining tension through the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early: prevent a treaty rupture with real communal consequences. Escalation is a density deepening—mirrors warm, voices overlap, options reweight—culminating in a single integrated image and the merfolk’s reply. The price is present (the fragment’s sacrifice and the moral renunciation of vengeance), though the path to success faces little resistance on the page. The tightening works under the accumulative lens but lacks a hard pinch point.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—death as destination vs. death as companion—tightens through the storm and the old woman’s verdict. The deepening occurs when the droplets “sing,” reconfiguring what Mara seeks; her agency is to refuse the easy exit and choose endurance. The price is ongoing: staying to listen in a perilous, grinding environment. External and internal conflicts braid cleanly without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (understanding vs possession) tightens through pattern discovery to the act of burning as a price. Escalation is a density increase: aligning, tracing, admitting, then committing to fire and burial. The cost is unmistakable: relinquishing the last physical remnant to seed absence. No antagonist, but internal and environmental pressures cohere and deepen options appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early: preserve the echo before it gutters. Escalation is a density increase: the echo manifests, then is divided and surrendered, with the live clock of fading memory. The meaningful tightening is the choice to offer silence and share shards, foreclosing possession for preservation. Pressure is coherent, though largely tonal rather than confrontational.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure builds through density and communal participation: more people arrive, the spiral coheres, night falls, images silver and clarify. Stakes tighten as photographs are surrendered and the ritual crystallizes; the trumpet man’s reclaimed melody gives a concrete cost/return. Conflict is gentle and largely externalized as renunciation rather than opposition, but the accumulative deepening satisfies this lens. One decisive intensification (the transformation at twilight) anchors escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: revive/understand the library’s growth versus sterile obsolescence. Escalation is a deepening: from listening, to honest testimony (“Mother”), to catalyzing “become,” to surrendering by restoring the crystals. The cost is an internal renunciation of control—a quiet but legible price. Pressure is coherent, if largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are focused—can he capture the note before memory erases the path—and escalate via pattern-making (markers → spiral → entering → pressing chalk). The tightening forecloses options: he trades his mobility/name for the pearl of memory. There’s no antagonist, but coherent pressure accumulates and the cost is unmistakable in the final tableau. Internal and external threads braid effectively without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are focused: preserve control by “repairing” or risk loss by surrendering to the spin. Pressure deepens coherently (quakes intensify; gear train reconfigures; explicit trade‑off: burn out vs halt the story). The decisive tightening is her choice to hold the shutter, sacrificing the film to complete the sentence. Price and consequence are legible, though an external counterforce beyond tremors is minimal by design.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—give a flawless goodbye before death—is present early and escalates via the time pressure and the incomplete record. The tightening beats (objects yielding tones; shards trembling; missing sliver solved by her pulse) are agency-driven and foreclose alternatives. Cost is felt in the surrender of the self (pulse) to complete the song/life. The pressure remains coherent and grows without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early and pressure coheres: each solution generates a deeper layer (riddle → secret door → shadow chamber → sacrifice). The meaningful tightening occurs when the cavity matches the spoon, forcing a trade‑off that stops the automaton. Cost is on‑page and changes options. Tension is mostly internal but escalates credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting guilt/mistake into guidance—tightens when Ivy chooses to press the tooth into the bones and hum, foreclosing denial. The ritual is the decisive deepening; the price is releasing the possibility of literal resurrection in favor of a luminous, conceptual repricing. No antagonist needed; internal and external conflicts braid cleanly. Escalation is elegant rather than high‑heat, but clear.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear early and deepen as the shard thins and the pearl’s presence demands a choice. The primary tightening is internal and ritual: risking the loss of a personal relic to achieve communal light. The price—relinquishing the sea glass—is visible and binds want versus need. Pressure skews contemplative over adversarial, but the escalation still reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—transforming a public wound into a private, living answer—intensifies as natural and technological patterns converge toward the “forgive” reveal. The pressure is quiet but coherent; the tightening is a reweighting rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens. Lira’s agency drives the resolution, and the price (relinquishing accusation, accepting vulnerability) is clear. A slightly sharper on‑page test might have further heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake—ethical reckoning with her created lives—tightens via the escalating cameos to the heroine at the vortex. The decisive act (naming and releasing) forecloses a path of control and safe plots, with visible cost (tears; loss of the shell’s ridges). The cadence shift from “against the current” to being carried by it marks a clean reweighting. Pressure remains coherent, driven by her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are singular and early: restore the Heartroot before alignment slips. Escalation is a controlled intensification via the three songs; the tree’s pulse and root‑stirring provide a tightening. Resistance is low and solutions work on first attempt, keeping cost modest. The cadence shift nonetheless feels earned within the chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture and contain starlight without spillage—is set early and tightened by successive, silence‑dependent steps. Escalation arrives as the animals animate/orbit and culminates in the sealing, with the felt price of loss and disciplined pace. The conflict skews internal/ritualistic, yet pressure coheres and rises under the lens. A sharper external hazard might heighten cost, but what’s here is sufficient and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are clear early—secure wonder before the lull ends—and pressure coheres through nightfall, frost, and the discovery of the crack. The key tightening is the crack’s leak and Arlen’s decision to solder and reverse the mechanism, which closes off the path of unmediated experience. The price is felt but the intensity is purposefully quiet; escalation is more deepening than reversal. Still, agency drives the outcome and costs reweight the end.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (win release by balancing burdens) is clear, with a clean tightening: small→medium→largest burden culminating in direct confrontation with the absorbing sphere. Agency drives the turn—she orients, breathes, and applies heat—rather than coincidence. The cost (partial calcification, loss of lamp’s potency) is legible and alters her ongoing state. Tension is mostly ritual‑charged rather than adversarial, but it still narrows options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—whether she can transform grief without breaking—tightens under time pressure. The meaningful turn is her commitment to “receiving” and working through the whistle, foreclosing avoidance. The cost is felt as she densifies absence into something she must carry. Quiet, but escalation is coherent and agency‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—renouncing regret-bound ambition to integrate self—pressurizes steadily through ghostly negotiations. The key tightening is the condition that the ride restarts only if she releases everything, forcing a concrete trade. The backward ride functions as a price-paid reversal that reweights options. Stakes remain intimate but consequential, with lasting on-page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are dominantly conceptual—can Mara convert abandonment into life—and escalate via a deepening pattern (hum intensifies; geometry resolves; flows redirect; fountain to vine). The principal tightening comes at the rotunda/fountain where alignment enables action. Cost is more contemplative than peril-driven; the lack of a harder price keeps the category below the top band, but agency clearly drives resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—whether Elian will renounce commerce and reclaim the silent dream—tighten via the garden’s escalating response (rings simulate the gear train; scent of the conception morning; the drawing absorbed). A clear deepening occurs when he declares the clock “no longer for sale,” foreclosing a path. Cost is felt but modestly dramatized; the main pressure is internal and textural rather than adversarial. The truncation mutes the final tightening beat’s full resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    One dominant stake—pursuing the cartographer/truth—escalates through a clear tightening: listening → map spiral → stepping onto water with tether → self-incrimination (naming lies) → cut tether → transit through glass. The visible price (cutting the rope and branding) narrows options. Agency drives every beat; coincidence doesn’t resolve anything. Stakes feel personal yet consequential, with the final choice foreclosing a return path.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserve ancient methods) tightens as the rope becomes a live language, then a charged artifact he must steward. The meaningful turn is the rope’s awakening and Hara’s choice to accept the weavers’ craft and future task. Price is mostly conceptual (identity shift, burden of patience), making escalation persuasive but quiet. A sharper on-page jeopardy or trade-off would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure tightens via density and a key break: the near-resurrection (moths shaping a face) dissolves, forcing acceptance. The dominant stake—can ritual bridge absence or must she redraw its coastline—narrows to an earned refusal to keep waiting. The price (giving up the dockside vigil) is legible. Quiet but decisive, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (life vs. obedient mechanism), and pressure tightens via the anchors cracking and the imminent fall. The assembling ritual and the apparition’s admonition deepen rather than reset stakes, leading to a committed leap that carries real loss. The cost is visible (abandoning the palace/role) and the consequence reshapes the world. Escalation is clean without coincidence bailing him out.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the boy’s distress catalyzes action, the father’s stake personalizes risk, and the coin decision tightens the emotional stakes. The meaningful deepening is the relinquishment of the compass-thread, which forecloses reliance on a protective token. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial; the visible price is internal but legible. A moment of sharper resistance before the gift could heighten the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens at the seventh fountain with the largest breadcrumb and the moral hesitation. The meaningful turn is Elara choosing action despite doubt, triggering the fountains and forcing the loss of her charged object. Pressure is steady and accumulative rather than combative; the visible price is the emptied/dissolved box and softened skepticism. Slight gentleness in external opposition keeps it short of peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—ending a generational cycle without fire—is pressured by the persistent inheritance embodied in the gear. Escalation arrives as the petals answer and ancestors coalesce, forcing a stance crystallization via the song and renunciation. The narrowing is clear: keep spinning the legacy or stop it; she pays by relinquishing object and self-form. Quiet but unmistakable tightening under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—giving shape to collective grief—is clearly established and deepens through mentor guidance and sustained labor. The tightening arrives as the migration completes, foreclosing further iterative attempts and forcing acceptance of the single flowing line. Cost is felt as relinquishment of monumentality for motion, and the public unveiling risks communal response. Escalation is more deepening than reversal but remains coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (restoring shared balance) is clear early and tightens at the mayor’s inscription, which forces a deeper acceptance with personal cost. Her agency drives the turn—installing the rake handle into the bob and winding despite past blame. Pressure coheres through accumulative absolution to the chime release. The conflict remains intimate rather than knife-edge, but the ethical calculus is legible and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake coheres: seek the shape of intentions and decide whether to cross. Pressure tightens with the blank name, cello‑like chord of forgiveness, and the door’s apparition, culminating in a trade‑off. The cost is legible (forgoing reunion now), and her agency drives the turn. Minor drift from initial “ground shiver” toward the mother‑door is absorbed into the coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—creating a future within limits—is signaled and tightened: from palm‑crack to equations to the spire’s conditional “partnership,” culminating in the final sigil that forecloses other paths. The felt price is quiet but present (accepting limits, dulling the nib). Escalation is thoughtful rather than adrenal; it still narrows options and raises conceptual cost convincingly. A slightly sharper on‑page consequence would lift tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes consolidate around preserving/reseeding narrative; pressure builds via the pirate signal’s invitations and the lyric’s choice. The meaningful tightening arrives with the binary—silence vs wandering—answered by stewardship. Tension remains more textural than adversarial, but agency clearly drives the turn. Slightly sharper consequence or risk on the page would heighten felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (safety vs. truth) is signaled early and tightens as the mask fuses, the chair slows, and she chooses to remove the mask. The curator’s silent presence adds pressure without resolving anything. The cost—abandoning the shield of curated concealment—is on the page. Escalation is a textural intensification rather than a reversal, appropriate for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—truth vs. regime narrative—with a meaningful tightening at the discovery of the twin cog and again with viable seeds. The renunciation to stay with messy evidence and the later choice to give seeds to the guard read as prices paid. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, fitting the lens, though the on‑page risk at the seawall is brief and not maximally leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—unlearning hatred into active listening—tightens through the naming of noise and the risk of letting dissonance remain. The decisive act (offering the rosette) forecloses her private hold and commits to a communal future, with felt price. Escalation is quiet but clear under the chosen lens, cresting in the blend of songs and the vow. Pressure is internal rather than oppositional but coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—saving/growing a living counter‑city through gentle means—is clear, and pressure coheres via the ticking alignment and looming officials. Escalation is primarily textural: prune → graft → ripen → share → officials arrive. Costs are soft; officials are conveniently outflanked and the protagonist faces no painful trade‑off on the page. The absence of a landed final beat limits the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—will the tower “sing” again, and what that means—tightens through the riddle and the match strike, which reweights options. Escalation is primarily experiential and cadence‑driven; the match’s ignition is the decisive intensification. The cost is present but soft, so pressure reads as wonder-leaning rather than risk‑driven. Resolution stems from Marisol’s agency and stance crystallization rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (relieve houses of noisy grief by witnessing) accumulate cleanly; the ritual’s repetition tightens toward the compass and bay‑level hush. The price—relinquishing the shard/identity—registers. Pressure is lyrical rather than adversarial, so escalation feels like deepening density more than narrowing options. Still, the widow recognition and compass beat credibly intensify the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether to transform from rigid guardian to conduit of nuanced memory—tightens with the ampoule’s prompting and the choice to mend through weakness. The escalation is gentle but clear: inquiry, self‑threading, ignition of color, and public invitation with visible reweighting of identity. The price is principled vulnerability rather than injury, but it reads on the page. No antagonist, yet coherent pressure persists.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—reconnect/resolve regret—pressurizes from first paragraph. Escalation tightens with the fissure, the staircase closing like pistons, and the dwindling “filament” of light, forcing the choice to offer the die instead of forcing entry. The price is the partial contact and acceptance of ongoing walking. Stakes remain coherent; no convenient rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes concentrate around proving remembered kindness before exhaustion; escalation is a density deepening consistent with the lyric lens (moon zenith, visitors gathering, brush singing). The meaningful price is unmistakable: the brush’s dissolution and Mira’s relinquishment of vigil. While tension is gentle rather than adversarial, one decisive tightening lands. No coincidence resolves pressure; agency and ritual drive the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reviving memory/culture—tightens when the lens fails, forcing a riskier tactic: burning irreplaceable texts to animate practice. The price is legible and alters options, leading to a warm chord and communal reawakening. Pressure remains coherent and escalates through choice, not coincidence; Amara complicates but does not solve without Lysandra’s decisions. The final act forecloses the artifact‑only path by embedding the lens in daily heat and steam.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres and deepens via the stepwise method (reverse rotation → splicing the stone → initiating the grind) with tangible intensifications (beam seizures, birds forgetting wings, waves reversing). Stakes move from personal defiance to world‑level tremor without feeling arbitrary. However, opposition is largely systemic and aesthetic rather than a resisting force, so escalation lacks a hard pinch point. The destruction of the stone and destabilized world register as on‑page prices.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—escape the recursion by outwitting fear—tightens through the paradox/dictionary gambit to the forced selection of the black mirror. The unbosoming escalates pressure, spawning hostile reflections. Agency drives the peak turn; the price is carried forward (advisor imprisoned; narrator marked). No luck‑solve; the pattern forces a meaningful trade.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early: preserve the orchard against the rising glass reef. Escalation coheres through density and tempo (warning → grooves → harmonics → whale cadence → shards surface → final chord). Cost is present but modest—she chooses to draw toward danger and commits energy and risk without a concrete loss. The reversal (obstacle becomes instrument) is earned and character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—breach the enclosure/answer the watchers—tightens through the burned crack, the expedition’s prophecy, and the city‑shaking chord. The prophecy reweights risk (waking/dive) and spurs her to an all‑in attempt. The price is on the page; consequences are felt city‑wide. The watchers’ cooperative mirroring slightly softens the sense of forced trade‑off, but the escalation remains protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.7)
    Pressure escalates through discovery → patterning → mapping consequences → resolve; the stylus beat is the clearest tightening. The cost is quiet but legible (blood, acceptance that persuasion is required), though external pushback is largely absent. Dominant stake remains coherent without false spikes. The result is strong but not fierce: more friction on the page would raise it.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are focused: inscribe/recall what can be saved before the drawbridge lowers. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal—ink drop to chandelier reveal to the living heartbeat—and culminates in a cost-taking vow. The price is to carry memory (ink’s weight) and accept limited agency against encroaching water. The pressure is quiet but coherent and tightens once meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around truth versus sanctioned narrative, tightening when the blackout removes digital crutches and when she chooses to pry the sealed vault. The discovery of pre‑ink tablets meaningfully deepens stakes by changing knowledge and foreclosing the comfort of the official chronicle. The cost is modest but legible—she embraces uncertainty over verdicts and risks institutional overwrite. Escalation is measured yet purposeful under the hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transformation of grief—is established early and tightened through the self‑wounding act of recording, the hundred‑crane threshold, and the sphere’s rupture. The escalation is textural rather than adversarial but still narrows options: to proceed she must relive pain and commit to release. The shudder/crack is a decisive turn that tests her commitment. The returned crane reframes cost as ongoing duty rather than a tidy fix.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via modeled disturbance amplitude, the lurching observatory, the airlock step, and the release/broadcast choices. The tightening forecloses options (she sacrifices the intact geode half; the window closes as breakers reset). The price is palpable in the vision of the intact wedding that “sliced her open,” and in accepting a future defined by risk and grief‑powered work. Pressure remains coherent and culminates in a stance crystallization rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are coherent early (belonging/home), with one strong tightening: the pilgrim’s condition that decoding must occur under the originating sky, followed by the instruction to follow pulsing trails. Agency drives the turns (aligning, slotting, following, closing the parenthesis), and the price is a shift from place-seeking to living with calibrated absence. Escalation is quiet but consistent with the accumulative design. No luck-driven resolution undercuts the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—will she face the truth and end her profitable silence—tightens through concrete discoveries (pulsing hand, tin box, note). The ticking/pulse deepens pressure into a must‑act choice that forecloses a path (continuing to forge without confession). The finale shows agency with cost: writing real names and releasing the page. Escalation is single‑step but decisive and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—complete the exchange without severing the future—tightens with the cords and the instruction to walk until they break. The key deepening arrives when the prisoners address each other; that human bridge triggers the audible snap, blending internal and external conflict. The price is conceptual and relational rather than visceral, but it lands. A slightly sharper sense of what failure would cost them personally might raise the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to pursue or to realign—tightens through the fog, failed instrument, and narrowing gut. The decisive turn (“ride the current”) and the obedience to the silhouette force a trade‑off: relinquish the old search logic to recover a different path. The price is clear in leaving the compass and accepting a non‑rescue resolution. Tension is steady, if more tonal than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (will he earn/embody empathy) is established early and escalates as the labyrinth shames each turn with past victims’ echoes. The key tightening is the sacrifice at center and the lake sealing wrong paths, forcing a singular route. The rescue that follows reads as consequence, not coincidence. Cost is legible without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake is clear early and escalates when the spirit requires “finish the change,” foreclosing the option to remain human. The price (surrender of name/humanity) is unmistakable and paid on the page. Agency drives turns: vow, partial shift, acceptance via inhaling spices and roaring. Tension deepens without external antagonist, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is explicit and tight; pressure deepens via the thread, the cards’ accusatory circle, and the revelation that time lives in absences. The decisive tightening is the relinquishment (“unfasten[ing] the final clasp of her regret”) which forecloses the fantasy of full reclamation. Cost is emotional, not logistical, but unmistakable in the choice to accept a scar over a cure. Escalation is lyric-deepening rather than reversal and reads coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the sealed dimension through shadow work—is signaled early and tightens through stitching, the corridor of shadows, and the final offer. The price (relinquishing the Tear) is unmistakable and grows organically from earlier beats. Pressure is coherent; no coincidences resolve the problem. A single, clean deepening rather than multiple reversals fits the form.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are internal but coherent: whether she can reframe “giving” without self‑erasure. Escalation arrives via successive releases culminating in the kept, heartbeat‑pulsing bug flying into the volcano, narrowing options toward acceptance. The cost is tangible (emptied jars, relinquished talisman, moving into shadow). Low external opposition, but pressure builds appropriately for the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—ignite revolt without exposure—tightens through the descent/programming and the patrol’s pass. The meaningful deepening is the return to post under heightened risk, not a neat reversal. Costs are implied (treason, danger) more than concretely paid. Still, pressure coheres and grows under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (fulfilling/redefining the promise through pattern mastery) is flagged early and tightens when the fragmentary vision requires a pattern switch and then a timed capture of falling dust. The on‑page price is subtle but legible: the curse’s partial lifting underscores the burden that returns, and the scattering of the charged rocks reads as renunciation. Escalation is primarily density and cadence rather than reversal, appropriate to the lens. A slightly sharper on‑page risk or jeopardy would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberating censored verses—tightens via a clear cadence: expose fragments, realize the vigil is listening, climb, project. The timer’s reversal and the lightning‑enabled projection mark the meaningful deepening. Cost is felt more conceptually than viscerally; external risk isn’t dramatized, but the renunciation (empty envelope, acceptance of scars) reads as a real price. Pressure remains coherent and grows toward a decisive final act.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—how to contend with sovereignty/answers—is tested through the duel’s ritual pressure and the code’s escalating choreography. The decisive tightening arrives when Lysandra flips the card, halting steel with music and forcing a stance shift. Cost is understated (both forgo the duel’s victory conditions), reading as an earned renunciation. A slightly sharper on-page price or foreclosed alternative would intensify stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve and propagate stories/resistance before the torching) is clear and tightens at the warden’s threat. The protagonists’ agency drives escalation: secret taxonomy, smuggling books, transforming the spiral into “bloom,” and burying the tin. Cost is legible in Lark’s forced departure under identity flux and the immediate danger to the annex. Tension coheres without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—rewrite departure into return before night “falls”—tightens via the horizon’s lateness and eventual hesitation. Escalation arises from agency: he risks trespass in the reel, selects a single frame, and performs to reprice fate. Visible price (destruction of the clock) accompanies the win. Minor limitation: opposition is atmospheric rather than adversarial, but pressure remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (anchor memory before monsoon) and tightens when the dream pages brown and the monsoon invades the dream. Mira adapts tactically by summoning witnesses and then paying the price of biting the fruit. The escalation is coherent and protagonist-driven. The danger remains largely symbolic rather than viscerally jeopardizing Mira, keeping the price high-concept.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to approach apology and separation—tightens through ritual to a single, costly stance: set the work adrift and decline confirmation. The compass’s shiver and mist’s instructions deepen pressure, culminating in the apprentice’s half‑smile and the refusal to fix its color. The final act forecloses the path of clinging/verification and reweights options toward openness. Tension operates at image and beat scales without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story's central conflict is internal, and it deepens with each observation. The stake—Mara’s understanding of endings—is clear and the pressure on her worldview mounts steadily. The discovery of the undecayed chrysalis serves as a decisive turn that crystallizes the conflict, leading to a resolution where the cost (her former pride in "precision") is palpable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes its dominant stake—understanding the mentor's death and finding purpose after trauma—with immediate clarity. The conflict escalates beautifully from an internal, atmospheric struggle to a tangible investigation. The discovery at the kiln provides a powerful deepening that redefines the conflict not as a simple matter of revenge against smugglers, but as a complex moral choice about how to carry a legacy, a cost that is made perfectly legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—can meaning be created from absolute loss?—is established immediately and deepens with poetic precision. The escalation is internal, shifting from personal rectification to a mission to "rectify this entire silent realm" after the encounter with the frozen bird. This turn provides a meaningful deepening of stakes, and the resolution is earned through Rowan’s agency, with the cost being the acceptance of this new, silent form of existence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The dominant stake—giving rest to the unburied—is established immediately and remains the focus. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure deepens thematically rather than through external opposition. The critical tightening occurs when Elias must write his own name, a choice driven by his own agency that forces a confrontation with his own mortality to complete his duty. This act ensures the resolution is earned with a clear, personal cost, making the final relighting of the beacon deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.5)
    The dominant stake—the survival of cultural identity, not just physical life—is established early and tested throughout. The conflict deepens perfectly under an accumulative lens, moving from the quiet desperation of the food run to Tomasz's articulated doubt, and culminating in the profound challenge posed by the seeds. The resolution, a declaration of hope, is earned by the visible cost of their long endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—healing an ancestral/past-life wound—is established early and deepens effectively. The escalation is textural, culminating in the revised vision of the pilgrim carrying a "wound shaped like an empty bowl," which clarifies the true nature of the conflict. The final resolution is driven by Mei-Ling's agency (breathing into the tear, reaching out) and carries the legible cost of processing the pilgrim's sorrow.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story establishes a high-concept stake—discovering the texture of time—and makes it visceral. The escalation is a masterclass in the accumulative mode: the photographs fade, geometry warps, and finally, the protagonist’s body disintegrates. Agency is expressed as the will to continue despite this dissolution, and the final cost is absolute and rendered on the page with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes are established immediately—personal freedom and global rebirth—and are tested under escalating pressure. The conflict tightens perfectly from a static puzzle (the chains and cipher) to a timed challenge (the falling wall) to a direct confrontation (the guards).

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—learning the quiet arithmetic of decay—tightens through each wing collected; the gradient of color loss is the escalating cost. Agency is attention and renunciation: she chooses to archive rather than mourn loudly. The final envelope forecloses spectacle. Slight deduction for thunder as external intensifier rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to use the ledger for revenge or memory—tightens when the frost trail proves the kiln still exhales. The projection beat forecloses denial; options narrow to witness.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—translate silence into living warmth—tightens through each fork’s color-pulse; the escalation is one sustained crescendo rather than multiple reversals, but the final chord visibly forecloses the option to keep the forks, paying with their dimming.

    Pressure tightens from sale to revelation; the buyer’s question re-weights stakes, forcing a stance crystallization at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled early and tightened when the mistaken letter forces a choice: risk exposure or institutionalize kindness. Each nightly session escalates density; dockhands’ daughter stamps anchors, grants fund welding classes—cost is visible in ledger margins. Coincidence (returned locket) complicates but does not resolve; it crystallizes the cycle’s cost.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation is a single decisive deepening rather than reversal: each borrowing of a second tightens the giant’s remaining nap, compounding cost until time snaps back at the climax. Agency is fully Lira’s; luck never rescues her.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to live with ambiguous loss—tightens through sensory accumulation rather than causal reversals. One decisive intensification: the sap-drop births a fern, reweighting the orchard from hushed auditorium to slow-returning song, with Lira’s agency intact.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—becoming visible—tightens when Lira sacrifices the custodian’s fragment to comfort the stranger; the trade-off is legible and irreversible. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she keep clinging to control or let the storm rewrite her—tightens once when she releases the grafting impulse and stays in the rain. Cost is visible: the notebook abandoned, the timer surrendered, the footprints erased. One tightening is sufficient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—the need to exchange memory for rest—intensifies as tide tightens the walkway window; cost (loss of family relic + surrender of wakefulness) crystallizes when she closes her eyes to the painted tomorrow. One meaningful tightening only, but it narrows options palpably. Conflict stays legible under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“magnify everyday magic”—is tested when darkness balances light. One decisive tightening: pearl sinks, void sings, futures collapse. Cost is felt in seer’s tears and pilgrim’s acceptance of unpredictable dawn. Agency lies in their joint song that re-opens futures. No external coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“compile fragments into meaning that lets exiles return”—is signaled early and deepens as each absence yields a syllable. Middle tightening occurs when barnacle voices force backward reading of lexicon, narrowing options to silence-as-signal. Cost is the perpetual deferral of certainty; agency is attention and arrangement. Escalation is accretive rather than causal, fitting lens, but one sharper external obstacle could have raised pressure another notch.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the unspoken sentence—tightens when each station deposits a regret-silhouette, raising the cost of continuing. The spiral staircase physically erases bad habits, a visible price that narrows options. Agency remains Elara’s: she presses the punch, ascends, accepts the confession. No coincidence resolves; the train vanishes only after the inward turn is complete.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and tightened once: the shard’s promise vs. pocket-dimension integrity. Escalation is accumulative: storm surge, color chaos, spatial mutiny, lantern hallway. Cost is legible on the page (eternity now threaded with every farewell). No coincidence resolves; Veyra’s agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—father’s asylum—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation tightens once: director’s suspicion → Lila’s breach → irrevocable stamp. Cost is the moral ledger she must now carry. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates (courier caught) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve vanishing textures—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is textural: hum thins, lamp forgets, urgency rises. One decisive tightening: Liang speaks the market-day textures aloud, deepening the lamp’s resonance. Cost is the lamp’s death and the thickened silence; agency is renunciation/acceptance rather than victory.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving existence beyond administrative death—tightens through accumulating fragments until the final reconfiguration. One clear escalation: label warms, sketches door, jars of sound revealed; cost is loss of fixed identity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: decode the riddle of myth vs. truth. Escalation is textural: each resonant hum thickens the pattern until the shell cracks and stakes flip from busting to preserving. Agency is continuous—bowing, tuning, catching dust. Cost is felt: bleeding fingers, crumbled shell, admission of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten from survey glyphs → mural counter-measures → chip-guided reorganization → dawn standoff; each intensification driven by Lila’s tactical choices, not luck. Corporate pursuit, carnival resistance, and dual allegiance converge in visible price: buyers routed, city unsold, future still precarious.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—photograph the ghost orchid—tightens via the live countdown and battery drain. One meaningful deepening: the crater shifts from scar to cradle, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is visible in the vaporized relic and the irreversible seven-minute bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode drone data before Orion sails—is signaled early and tightened by the loudspeaker countdown; the single deepening is Mara’s race against the whistle. Cost is the audible absence after the drone departs.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—“find where the rivers begin before vanishing”—is signaled early and tightened by each beat: falcon dive, melting circle, forfeited shelter. One meaningful deepening: the phrasebook’s absorption of moisture reweights the stake from search to declaration. Cost is visible (outpost lost, predecessor’s fate recalled). Agency drives escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring the town’s rhythm—escalates through each footfall and echo; the tightening is the moment the tuner sets the fork down and relinquishes control, letting the rhythm continue without him. Cost is visible in his solitary exit.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve one moment—is signaled early and tightened by the live oxygen clock. The single decisive turn (releasing the perfume) narrows options and exacts an on-page price: the memory vanishes, the temple grants a different future. Pressure escalates under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—gathering the hush to redeem his father’s legacy—is signaled early and tightened when mirrors collapse into the ring. Escalation is driven by Leif’s agency under Accumulative lens; cost is the irreversible fusion. One decisive intensification suffices. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—repaying the soul-debt—is signaled early and tightened through each resonant awakening until the bead’s dissolution forecloses further wandering. Cost is visible: the bride’s own dissolution and the orchard’s loss of magic.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“mend the ruin of a drowned city”—is signaled early; pressure escalates via nightly returns and the spiral’s narrowing, culminating in the irrevocable trade of illustration plate for living stone boat; cost is visible in the vanished plate and sealed labyrinth.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring faith in a forsaken soil—is signaled early and tightened by each unearthed bone. Escalation is textural: each relic increases the weight of memory until the sundial’s light crystallizes the cost of remembrance. Agency remains hers; no coincidence resolves the arc. The price—carrying soil that is both orchard and graveyard—is legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finish the chart before the coup—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightens when the flame leans east. One decisive turn: unstitching conspiracies into escape routes, paid for with blood and time. Pressure coheres under causal lens; no coincidence resolves anything. Cost is visible (three drops of blood, sleepless night) and alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver the apology and face the cost—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened through each condensation message. One meaningful deepening: the blank letter forces Lira to pay blood for words, foreclosing avoidance. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never rescues. The felt price (scarless cut, dissolved letters) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—sisterly guilt fused with linguistic duty—tightens once: decoding the pulse-cipher forces her to confront shared war fear and hand the coral future to children; the spiral of words raises the cost of retreat exactly under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stake is the recovery of lost communal joy. Orchard’s creaked caution constitutes single escalation; cost (risk of remembering too brightly) is articulated verbally rather than embodied through lost tool, stamina, or social price, so the tightening lands slightly soft-edged.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—certainty vs. curiosity—is signaled in the third sentence and tightened when the hobo demands “one answer for one wonder.” The final choice to embed the nickel and leave the flaw forecloses the path of perfect restoration with visible cost. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Coincidence (miniature hobo) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve unlicensed language—tightens when mimic auditors land; Lysander’s agency drives each beat (planting seed, flicking mimic, checking glyphs). Cost is felt: spark may burn the hand. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—turn grief into beauty without erasure—escalates via cumulative intensification: each century adds a layer of melody, vine, and star-flower until the final hammock suspends the poet between memory and sleep. Cost is legible in the centuries of wakefulness and the silvered hair used for binding.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve Liora’s name—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: crack widens → need original sound → phonograph fails → giggle ghost succeeds. Agency drives escalation; cost is the caretaker’s unspoken name. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—archive survival—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation tightens once: demolition crews arrive, forcing Arden’s public reversal. Cost is the spent ink and shattered well; trust must now be “kept performing.” Agency lies in Lira’s encoded promises and Arden’s live choice. No coincidence resolves; music and tablets earn the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—balanced flow versus eruption—is signaled inside first 60 words and escalates through millimetric tension and haptic risk. Cost embodied in soft volcano pulse rather than magma threat lands directly on page.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reunion across sacred distance—tightens once when the maze opens its silver corridor. Cost is visible (Iona’s trembling step onto the rail), but escalation is single-note; no secondary pressure complicates the path.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—belonging—is signaled in line 1 and tightens through each refracted constellation until the city’s memory reveals her own past. Agency is her decision to step into the firefly spiral and accept the city’s rhythm; cost is the irreversible crumbling of the feather and the knowledge she can never truly leave. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“find the path that mattered most”—is signaled early and tightens with each seed. The second seed’s memory of the bird tasting gloom deepens the pattern, forcing recognition that the cave itself erases corridors; this is the single meaningful deepening required. Cost is legible: she forfeits the illusion that paths can be fully restored, accepting instead the perpetual pulse of missing pieces. Agency is present but gentle—planting, whispering—sufficient for lyric mode, yet not razor-forced under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Main stake: reveal order within randomness; conflict escalates spool by spool, each marble foreclosing an option (boy drops snow-cone, sailors reconcile). Guiña factor: Finch’s own hunger becomes weaponized; cost is tangible (gull, almonds paid by Finch).

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—reclaim memory under ban—tightens through each forbidden arabesque; the spontaneous anchor (garden’s root) raises cost. Escalation is Accumulative: tide swell, rune fledge, starlight release. No coincidence resolves; final choice forecloses return to city anonymity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—proving value in the mundane—escalates through the prism’s refraction of flaws into epiphanies. One decisive tightening: Elowen chooses to leave the panes, paying the cost of an empty satchel and the city’s impending amnesia. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—“transform despair into possibility”—are signaled early and tauten as balloons turn from leaks into returning pollen. Escalation is gently textured, not sharply obstructed; the price is conceptual recursion, not tactical loss, keeping score a hair below elite bands.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Diary fragments escalate stakes: each charred page tightens Mara’s path and reweights the sky-forgotten legacy. One distinct beat of cost—she forfeits silence by recording echoes—grounds the conflict under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“to persuade mirrors to show possibilities”—steadily intensifies from first line to last dance until the cost is the loss of external metronome. Only one turn, but it reweights options and registers the cost in her own chest. Escalation coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redemption through ritual presence—is signaled early and tightened when Kelis completes the circle; the cost is the literal weight surrendered. Agency remains with Aurelia’s silent pacing and final kiss. One meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens; no false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—control of water—tightens when her sentimental impulse forces the release that ends the drought. One meaningful turn: pouring the stolen water narrows her options to zero and triggers the river’s return. Cost is visible and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate suppressed voices from imperial silence—is signaled early and tightened with each untwisted thread.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    Tension escalates sentence-by-sentence: the tyrant puppet’s “Truth is whatever survives the scream” forces the story-stick to reverse, then the child puppet rewrites sparks into fireflies that spell FORGIVENESS—each move tightens stakes and makes silence more costly. Meteor-hush pressure charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether a fragile amen can answer an interrupted cadence—tightens once when the tower’s knot loosens and the thread goes slack; the cost is the grotto’s inevitable forgetting. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, though the escalation is more cadence-shift than causal narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore the erased names—is signaled in paragraph three. Escalation is a single deepening: rope reconfiguration turns memory into living vibration, foreclosing the path of silence. Cost is visible—the rope’s tension permanently altered, her footprints glowing with the names. Agency is hers; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single dominant stake—why paths choose walkers—escalates as directive hungers and storm gains teeth. Transcendent crossing narrows options: embody prophecy or vanish with bunker.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—certainty that heaven’s gears will hold—escalates in discrete steps: scarcity, tile pattern breakthrough, covenant demand. Each turn is driven by Naram-Sin’s agency and paid with a visible, cumulative cost (star-charts surrendered, future nights owned). Pressure tightens to crystallized stance: silence and submission are the only paths left.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“silence the echo of drums”—is signaled early and tightened when Lira chooses to plant the pin instead of using it. Escalation is driven by her agency under Accumulative lens; each iteration of the lullaby deepens cost. The price is her lifetime and the soldiers’ frozen moment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“recreate the boundary without cages”—tightens through each synchronized breath; the moth’s descent marks the decisive micro-turn. Cost is visible: she forfeits her prior craft identity when the orchard re-blooms and the sextant re-measures souls.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—mending the generational breach—is signaled early and tightened by each graft, prism flash, and lullaby note. Pressure grows through embodied choices; the final binding of wrists forecloses estrangement with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—inherit the orchard or flee—is signaled in paragraph 5 and tightened when Elara sees her own future weeping self. Escalation is driven by her agency: planting the seed, pressing the cameo into bark. The price—loss of self and memory—is legible on the page. No external reversals are needed; the Möbius structure supplies the deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—salvage humanity’s unlearned lessons—is signaled early and tightened when Elara must prove this generation will listen. The renegotiation with the guardian narrows options and exacts the price of permanent stay.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—keep or relinquish the sister’s memory—tightens through each surreal beat; the final chord exhalation forces the decisive trade-off, with the ship’s dissolution as undeniable price.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover the erased treaty—tightens when the clock begins ticking backward, foreclosing the option to leave history absent. Cost is palpable: the seal dissolves into the rope, a permanent sacrifice. Escalation is one meaningful turn, sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she cling to hoarded silence or release it—tightens through each interaction with the stone and the beings. The final act of placing the stone forecloses her old method of map-making; cost is the loss of her curated archive. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—relight the beacon—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: each fracture demands a named loss, narrowing options until silence is spent. Agency is continuous; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Visible cost: shard dissolves, tower left defenseless.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—how to remember without betrayal—tightens when the obelisk’s impossible shadow forces Lira to abandon curation for listening. Agency drives escalation: each measurement is a choice that forecloses omission. The cost is visceral when the ink bruises into the obelisk. A hair more external pressure would push it to 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled early and tightened when the mosaic demands the rag. One decisive intensification: stuffing the cannon forecloses weapon use and seeds stars. Cost is the rag itself and the fortress’s irreversible bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—repairing sibling silence—tightens when Mara arrives and the cicada reveals the withheld letter. One meaningful deepening: shared vision converts private grief into mutual witness. Agency is renunciation (leaving cicada) with visible cost (no more foresight). Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence (Mara’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—collecting/experiencing silences vs. bunker survival—tightens when Lira must choose to leave the rooted doll as anchor; the hourglass of inversion forces each taste to matter, and the final muting of the siren shows escalating agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—teaching silence to comfort—is crystallized by the child’s sigh and the storm-glass flare, a single meaningful intensification under the Accumulative lens. Agency is subtle but real: Lira steers posture, gaze, and breath until the child’s own sound catalyzes resolution. The felt price is the emotional surrender of farewell and the adult’s acceptance of irreversible departure. A touch more tension in the beats preceding the sigh would have pushed 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (unclaimed throne vs. memory) tightens when the orchard demands narrative steps as tribute; the sunrise clock narrows options—each footfall costs a past memory, and arrival seals revelation behind fresh paint.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—teaching herself to breathe through absence—is signaled early and escalates via the gathering shadows; the tightening beat (ring pressed to sternum) narrows options and carries a felt cost, though the price remains more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (regret into clarity) is signalled early with a single tightening beat: "reconciliation meant letting the pressure... press regret... into sharp futures." No extraneous reversals; coincidence complicates only.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—erase the bloodline—tightens when the confession reveals Lira is the heir. One decisive deepening under Accumulative lens: knowledge reweights the mission irrevocably. Cost is felt in the whispered name and relinquished crank.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—redeem the forgotten oath—signaled in line 2. Escalation is accretive: each remembered knot tightens the cost of refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—holding the line against forgetting—is signaled early and tightened by each salvaged relic. The broadcast is the decisive act that forecloses stealth; cost is the perpetual return alone. Pressure escalates via accumulative texture rather than causal turns, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent the prophecy’s broadcast—is signaled in the Morse “silence” and escalates as each note becomes a potential trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—decode the leaves before the arbor forgets—tightens once when the last leaf trembles; escalation is driven by Elian’s agency (building monuments, climbing) with visible cost in his bodily dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to live once certainty fractures—tightens when three clocks stop at 11:17, forcing Elian to choose descent or denial. The cost is legible: he forfeits conventional repair for improvisational mentorship, a felt trade-off under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—redeem the name—tightens when each zodiac shift forecloses an easier absolution. Escalation is Accumulative: density of regret increases until the crucible becomes the only path.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—integrate lost laughter into healing—is signaled early and tightened once: the collector must trade her hoarded sins for harmony. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals; the cost (empty vials, dissolved detachment) is on the page. Agency drives the final retuning.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Kael reach mercy/zero pressure—tightens via strap feedback and Fibonacci pacing; each miscalculation (17 steps) raises cost. Agency is continuous; no external coincidence resolves the spiral. Final loosening forecloses the path of further penance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide”—tightens when the ghosts’ pointing forces Mara to choose between safe ignorance and irreversible knowledge. The cost is legible: she forfeits her trade and identity, walking out under a sky that is now her next shaft.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—rupture of perfection—is signaled in paragraph four and escalates through each uncorking. Agency is absolute: every whisper released tightens the spiral toward collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—who owns the past and how it may be used—tightens when Mara moves from solitary translation to shared covenant; the price is her relinquishment of sole authorship, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—return dawn to children—escalates through each tethering beat; the covenant’s counter-attack raises cost until Midnight’s bargain is broken. The price (Midnight’s essence surrendered) is legible, though the external stakes could feel more viscerally pressed on Emil’s body.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—finding where explanations fail—is signaled early and tightens through each descent. The psychometric reading and the compass’s sideways lock constitute one meaningful deepening that narrows options. Agency is renunciation, not passage, with on-page cost (compass surrendered). Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no external coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—how to keep the loop of alliances alive—escalates through each arrival: cartographer, musician, sailor, child. Each adds a plank or chime, tightening the spiral until the blank slide forces Mara to reimagine again. Cost is felt in the perpetual return.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: render the night-bloom answer before winter seals the valley. Escalation is textural: each dusk adds density—postcards, pigment, synchrony—until the final release forecloses the need to understand. Cost is the shift from urgency to witness. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (new postcard) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the disappeared—is signaled early and escalates through empathic risk. The cipher’s demand for empathy narrows options; arranging debris becomes the irreversible act that forecloses emotional safety. Cost is visible in the retrocognitive flood and the blank diary.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—revival without miracles—is signaled early and tightens through the alchemist’s escalating refusal of wish-based solutions.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the city’s pulse by reviving forgotten reciprocity—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the accidental prophecy forces Elowen from passive archiving to active oath. Cost is the irreversible crack of the cylinder and her relinquished detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—inheritance as responsibility versus possession—tightens when the membrane threatens to tear; her choice to seal rather than seize narrows future options. Cost is legible: she forfeits immediate knowledge and assumes lifelong guardianship. Escalation is single but decisive under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—whether the janitor can hear the station’s silence—tightens when meteors veer toward him after he equalizes pressure. The cost is visible: his pulse flickers, centuries of neglect spiral backward. Agency drives the turn, though the price could be even more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    Central stake—the need to name silence—escalates as each withheld promise adds mass to the stained glass box; pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens without external coincidences. Tightening arrives when the box grows “heavier with every syllable”; a felt price scales to the length. Closure reconfigures options rather than resolving external conflict, satisfying escalation test for lyric short work.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to live with incompleteness—is signaled early via the snapped kite string. Escalation is accretive: each act of tending (crab, kelp, gulls) tightens the pattern until the spiral’s erasure forces the stance crystallization. Cost is the acceptance of endless, visible in the dissolving footprints.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmit respect beyond her lifespan—tightens each month; the six-month clock converts abstract mortality into tangible urgency, culminating in the irreversible act of wiring her remains into the orchard’s circuitry.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—tightens once when Mara realizes it is fermentation, not formula. Cost is felt in the embrace that floods her with ancestral miles. Agency drives every escalation; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

    Dominant stake—restore biotic harmony to poisoned ground—is signaled at “fertilize the battlefield.” Each sowing and animal response tightens the task: gulls prescribe watering rhythms, heron traces the readiness circle. Cost accrues in maternal ash and final lost language relinquished into tide. Only reservation: the “submerged concord” itself emerges late without earlier agency impact, trimming escalation peaks to merely vivid pattern-completion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—translate distance into closeness—tightens when the dog realizes translation requires surrendering physical return. Escalation is accumulative: each revealed scent shortens the “mileage of ash” until the final stance crystallizes. Cost is visible in the dog lying down to “dream of paths that no longer need bodies.” No coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to join the refugees or restore time—tightens when the compass needle steadies on “vector of will.” One decisive intensification: sketching accelerates into engine-reviving compression. Cost is the exile’s identity shift from pariah to navigator, paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: amend the wrong sky by amending the self. Pressure tightens once—when Kael must trade his hidden name for wonder. The swap of knight for pawn narrows options; the leap forecloses retreat. Cost is the spire’s dissolution and his unmoored identity.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is legible—preserve vanished stories—but stakes escalate tangibly only in last quarter. Each spelled word tightens task from REMEMBER to FORGIVE to OBSERVE to STAY, showing progression. Tension arises from internal compulsion rather than external opposition. Agency is active; cost is felt. Could use sharper earlier external pressure to reach 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—recovering the lost language—tightens once when the stone pulses harder and she chooses to speak. Agency is clear, cost is legible, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when each decoded thread whispers “You taught fear.” One decisive turn: sitting in the chair and accepting the tipped king. Cost is the irreversible loss of the prodigy and the years in exile; pressure is coherent under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—liberate forgiveness from the Council’s monopoly—is signaled early and tightened as the ritual clock approaches.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning or sink—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is accretive: each crater stitched raises the cost of failure until the final tightening reweights the apprentice’s fate. Agency remains with the narrator; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—renege on the theft or surrender it—is visible by the cockle-shell crunch. Lagoon rise escalates the cost; floating shell tints the water, forcing a stall that dramatizes the choice. No external antagonist; pressure is coherent internal erosion under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.7)
    One dominant stake—purify intentions by proving whispers travel farther—runs unwaveringly. The vibration’s demand escalates to a single decisive turn: tenderness must scream to be heard, foreclosing the gentler option with unmistakable physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Absent brother’s echo crystallizes as tangible stake; ritual builds escalate risk—cut palm, searing bronze—until the choice to cross costs the last anchor of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single escalating pressure: storm approaching → fear will collapse orchard → plant eye → risk of exposure. Final beat locks down options and displays felt price. Storm does not save them; their own act does.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will the keeper accept the transferred grief?—is signaled early and tightens through each gap counted. The deepening is driven by his agency (pouring memory into each vessel) and costs him his prior emotional insulation. One meaningful intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—keep or rewrite Lila’s fate—signaled in paragraph two. One tightening: doorway offers rewrite, Elias refuses, path closes. Cost is the lost chance and sealed return. Pressure grows causally with rising water and fading bloom; no coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—the sky will die within three nights—compresses time; each beat of ascent raises bodily cost and ethical stakes, culminating in the queen choosing to carry (and become) the spark.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to inhabit presence without capture—signaled in paragraph 1 and tightened when Liora crushes the last pocket-sun, foreclosing the bottled-time path. Escalation is accretive: each ember, vial, and filament increases density until the helix crystallizes choice. Cost is visible: loss of all pocket-suns and the lifetime compressed into one breath. Agency drives every beat; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is distilled clarity vs. living chaos; pressure tightens from grave-foreknowledge to the refusal to keep chronicling, forcing a renunciation that pays visible cost (scroll ash, single face). Single deepening is coherent but lacks secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering a way to “read” emotion without smell—tightens when Milo asks her to feel for the fracture. The screw’s insertion is the single decisive act that forecloses reliance on fragrance; the cost is the audible ticking she must now bear. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; no reversals, one deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transform scars before composure shatters—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened by the held-breath clock.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver apology before bulldozers—tightens with the live clock of chainsaws. Agency drives every beat: uncorking perfume, guiding the drop, folding requiem.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: witness must decide whether to preserve or release the last word. Escalation is textural—definitions evaporate, spiral tightens—until the blank page forces the choice. Cost is the erasure of her own witness identity, paid on the page. Agency remains hers throughout; no coincidence resolves the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—proving the impossible alignment—tightens when the horizon sags; the shepherd’s agency is to commemorate rather than correct, foreclosing professional rectitude. Cost is the thirteen-second drift and tomorrow’s silence. Escalation is a single deepening, sufficient under Accumulative lens, but external pressure (charter officers) remains off-stage, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding letting go—tightens when the farm itself “chooses instead to invite it in.” One decisive intensification suffices; cost is felt in the diffusion of her grief into spore-light.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: reconcile with the dead father’s contradictions without gambling her own heart. Each scrawl raises the emotional ante; the roof scene forces the decisive stance crystallization. Agency is hers—she chooses to carry the lantern up, then chooses to draft a new lecture. Cost is the acceptance of infinite deck, finite love.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—whether estrangement can be reversed—tightens when Mara must apply her own method to herself. The disc’s loop escalates from background hum to structural force, forcing her recursive self-call. Cost is the literal shattering of her tool and her dispersal into wires.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory or drown—tightens once when the jetty dissolves and she chooses annotation. Escalation is a single, decisive intensification under Accumulative lens; cost is the self’s erasure. No reversals needed; the covenant’s whisper suffices as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—bartering loneliness—tightens when the scale verdict forecloses retreat. Escalation is textural: rumor → fox → sparrows → spiral, each layer raising the cost of trust.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—"uncharted emotional depths"—is signaled early and tightened when the melody demands she name grief aloud. One meaningful deepening suffices; the cost is the irrevocable internalization of the song.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: translate silence into music before total anonymity. Escalation is accretive—each signed phrase tightens the cadence until the final arpeggio forecloses return.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the child’s reflection—signaled by noon drowning and spiraling water. Escalation is one deepening: still water → vortex → pearl lift, each stage narrowing ritual options.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—how to honor forbidden grief—tightens via each petal removed and shaving dropped. The final act (cedar heart + petal) forecloses the option of public mourning; the cost is the mandate-trained silence that swallows even tears. Escalation is steady, not explosive, fitting the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“borders are only weather in slow motion”—tightens once through the keystone inscription and the lake’s refusal to keep above and below from trading places, price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the texture of connection—is signaled early and deepens through each opened jar. Escalation is textural: each released sound braids into the next, tightening the weave until the room becomes a living cathedral. The cost is the irreversible decision to remain guardian.

    Single dominant stake—will she teach the garden to bloom or stay locked in grief—signals early and tightens through each crane fold and seed string.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mapping post-crash culture—is signaled early and tightens once when Mara realizes value has migrated into gestures. The cost is conceptual (the map itself will crash), but the pressure could be sharper if a concrete resource were visibly forfeited.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover the day innocence ended—tightens through escalating memory loops and the irreversible act of purification. One decisive deepening: cracking the core releases raw grief, foreclosing comforting nostalgia. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates. Cost is felt in the collapsing archive and luminous veil.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the shape of hope”—signaled early and tested by devouring shadow. One meaningful tightening: library’s own silhouette is the threat, forcing intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to respond to betrayal without abandoning compassion—tightens once: from shock to reconstruction to reporting. The cost (loss of innocence, exposure risk) is legible, though the external pressure plateaus after the raid reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake is introduced in the first three sentences: locate the storage place of unused love. Each beat deepens that search: first as inventory deception, then as psychometric excavation, finally as recognition that love hides in the dark interval between frames. The tightening is subtle but legible—options narrow from external rescue to internal embodiment, and the price is paid by relinquishing reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—freeing creativity from fear—is signaled early and tightened by each failed artwork memory. The midpoint mirror-turn forces the trade-off: look at self, not sky, or remain caged.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Primary stake announced in line 1: carry memory of what is erased. Each micro-intensification narrows the chance to “recapture” toward the final act of cultivation. The archive’s offer, refusal, and reciprocal “gift of memory” force visible cost: to save the shadows he must lose the ledger. Escalation remains internal/accumulative rather than causal but tightens with each bloom-whispered name he must quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim mental wilderness before certainty paves it—tightens when DELUSION path forces surrender of past identity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—tightens through the discovery of the crown defacement; the rune’s activation is the decisive escalation that forecloses the pretender’s narrative and costs Thimble his last ink pellet.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why routes vanish—tightens through each beat: erased charts → coordinates → unsounded circle → folded paths.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the mess”—tightens when the map appears; the choice to stay and transmit forecloses immediate escape. Cost is visible in the tug’s engines idling while she remains grounded.

    Dominant stake—will Lira be pressed into paper or redesign reality?—is signaled early.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—recover the vanished researchers—signaled in paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—broadcast the contraband truth—tightens once when Tatiana chooses mass exposure over personal safety. Escalation is causal: each override step narrows escape until the files are loose. Price is the irreversible scandal and her own exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve continuity through tending roses—tightens when scavengers arrive. One meaningful deepening: offering the rose as ceasefire narrows options and carries visible social cost. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—permission to let memory dissolve—is signaled early and tightened once when she widens the mandala’s ring, trading remembrance for emergent pattern. Cost is felt in the silhouettes’ silent goodbyes and her pocketed relics. Agency drives the escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake “save the collapsing timeline” is clear and escalates as coin-cold deepens and single ending threatens. Tightening beats: coin exhalation → hoop rolls → tree drinks coin; cost is her erasure. Agency is poetic more than tactical; escalation still narrows to a single preserved hush.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can the rose be coaxed back to life?—is signaled by the drifting petal and tightened each time Mira presses the gauge tooth to a cane. One meaningful deepening occurs when the first bead of green appears; options narrow from “let it die” to “shield this flame.” The cost is her vigil and vulnerability, visible in the violet dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightened once: the stone circle’s hum forces Mira to choose between remaining a memory or becoming the echo that sings alone.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.0)

One minor slack: the “vital key” label is repeated without fresh pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy for three vanished lives—tightens through the act of painting absence; the ribbon reunion narrows options to surrender or conceal. Agency is Elias’s throughout; cost is the exposure of his private ritual to the arriving officers.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—reverse exile or accept it—signaled in paragraph 5. Escalation: each stanza narrows possibility until the mirror offers only substitution, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)

    Dominant stake—finding the courage to face what mirrors hide—is signaled early and tightened when the seed demands planting where nothing grows.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore balanced light—tightens when Lyra must choose which memories to surrender; the seed’s demand narrows options. Escalation is causal: each memory offered intensifies the maze’s glow and the mirrors’ tremble. Cost is visible on her wrist and in the reclaimed dusk.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Primary stake—possession of the unspoken lullaby—intensifies when the cipher demands belief itself as currency.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)

    Dominant stake—how to meet endings—is signaled early and tightened once: from seeking her own death to accepting the labor of witnessing others’. The storm’s arrival and the old woman’s directive force a single decisive stance crystallization. Cost is visible: perpetual, unchosen service.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—permission to understand vs possess—intensifies through tactile rituals (placing, tasting ash). One clear deepening: realization that missing post is fertile gap, narrowing options to stewardship not pursuit. Cost scales to length.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve the prophet’s echo—is signaled early and tightened when the walker must surrender control to communal memory. One meaningful deepening: the echo becomes visible, then divisible. Cost is felt in the private atlas now shared. Agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transmute pain into masterpiece—tightens as each photograph narrows the spiral toward center. Collective arrival escalates texture rather than conflict; cost is diffuse but legible in the archivist’s relinquishment of her collected memories to the soil.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to decode or surrender to the library’s living memory—tightens through each crystal-activated testimony. Pressure escalates as the scholar’s agency narrows to listening; the cost is the abandonment of lifelong scholarly purpose. The shift is felt but not viscerally priced.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: locate the sound of growing older. Stakes tighten within the spiral; each driftwood marker narrows path until only the chalk center remains. Agency crystallizes his stance (endures silence) with visible cost—memory erasure becoming the recorded note. One decisive tightening reconfigures options without external coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—“harness the ephemeral” versus surrender to it—tightens once through a credible turn (re-tuning the lens for streak imagery) that forecloses the repair mission. The price is dramatized: “empty canister,” “luminous husk.” Agency remains consistently on the page; no coincidence rescues. One deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—deliver a flawless goodbye—tightens as the blood-work clock runs. Escalation is accumulative: each mundane object adds sonic pressure until the reconstructed vinyl becomes the only path left. The final hiss of the record equals Mrs. Eland’s last breath; cost is audible and irreversible. Agency remains with Mara throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“to find where shadows go at noon”—is signaled early and tightened through each looped memory until the final merging forecloses return. Agency is exercised at each beat (turning key, pressing sundial, inserting spoon) with escalating conceptual cost. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether guilt can be transmuted into guidance—tightens when Ivy must decide to return the tooth or keep it. The girl’s revelation escalates pressure under the Accumulative lens; the cost is the visible dissolution of the skeleton into light. No external antagonist is needed; internal stakes suffice. Slight deduction for off-stage origin of the “mistake.”

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and tested by the polishing sequence. One meaningful tightening: once the glass is thinned to translucence, failure means permanent darkness for the village. Cost is visible: loss of the shard and of private star-memories. Pressure escalates through tactile beats rather than external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to answer her brother’s viral confession—tightens once: from seeking scrubbed logs to choosing living rebuttal. The rose insertion is the single decisive act that forecloses online retaliation; cost is the thorn-scored palm and the wait for bloom. Escalation is textural, not causal, but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—collecting hopes while facing self-betrayal—tightens with each spectral accusation. Escalation is driven by the protagonist’s agency: every spoken name forecloses a narrative path, paying the cost of relinquishment. Pressure deepens rather than reverses, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation proceeds via each song tightening stakes: silence feeds rot → Lilt revives leaves → Dirge demands total breath, narrowing options until golden stories are the only outcome with visible vocal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: safekeep starlight before total loss. Escalation is accumulative—each fold adds density until the final seal forecloses further harvest. Agency is renunciation: she chooses memory over revival, paying with the orchard’s last latent light. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and temporal. Cost is visible in the rusted artifacts’ disintegration and the orchard’s faint shimmer that will fade.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder before season’s lull ends—tightens with each dial click; the harvest of echoes narrows from boundless laughter to a single boxed note, the price being exile from spontaneous wonder. Escalation is Accumulative/Textural: density of stored memories increases until the cellar’s silence becomes the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake—measure all gathered burdens before escape—signaled early. Accumulative pressure escalates via sphere-to-flame absorption culminating in calcification; options foreclose when bronze reclaims her body. Cost is visceral: coral-to-stone transformation visible on page. No external antagonist; burden itself is pressure. Closure reconfigures her walking world into tethered gentleness. Meets 8.8+ guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake: transform inert grief into portable memory before the kettle screams. Escalation is the accelerating press-and-release rhythm that narrows options from carving to compression. Cost is the blank’s vanishing and the lions’ final departure. Agency is Mara’s alone; coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—release every ambition to restart the ride—tightens once: each fragment returned raises the cost until the single remaining option is total surrender; the price is dramatized as the camera wheel clicks empty and vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (restore abandoned space) signaled immediately; intensifies through cascading micro-decisions—each rerouting lowers remaining battery charge and escalates fatigue—until final image crystallizes irrevocable shift. Agency remains primary; no coincidences resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaim or abandon the silent-clock dream—signaled early. Escalation is textural: hush deepens, crystal demonstrates motion, scent thickens, sphere absorbs drawing. One tightening beat: Elian omits every escapement that would speak. Cost is the forfeiture of commercial viability; felt in graphite vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—map lies to find the cartographer—tightens through spiral alignment and paper-rope tether; each beat raises the cost of self-deception. The decisive turn (cutting the rope) narrows options irrevocably. Pressure is mostly internal; external stakes remain abstract, capping the score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve pre-industrial memory—is signaled early and tightened when electricity’s erasure looms. Escalation is accumulative: each decoded knot increases the cost of failure; the final keeper knot forecloses the option to merely store seeds. Agency remains Hara’s; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mapping absence to heal—tightens through each written lantern; the final line redraws the coastline, foreclosing endless waiting. Cost is visible in the traveler’s stiff knees and emptied hands.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty or perish with the palace—is signaled early and tightens as each stalactite cracks. One meaningful deepening: Halric realizes preservation kills choice, forcing the leap. Escalation is accumulative: each relic added raises emotional cost until the final transformation. Agency drives every turn; coincidence only complicates (anchors fail), never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—“prove scars can sing”—escalates when kite snag revives fire boundaries; micro-choice to pass coin/last bird intensifies commitment after visible tension. Coincidence (exact stake remains) complicates rather than resolves; cost is present but not sharply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—liberate trapped memories—signaled in paragraph 4. Escalation is accretive: each breadcrumb recovered tightens the cost (box grows heavier, city resists). Seventh-fountain reversal forces the decisive act that re-opens the pipes; price is the box’s emptiness and her tempered skepticism. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—break the generational burn—signals early and tightens through each ancestral flare. The meaningful turn arrives when the sentimentalist sets the gear down, renouncing possession to foreclose the cycle; cost is the dispersal of self into light. Pressure accumulates via ancestral apparitions and gear acceleration, all under the Accumulative lens. One minor slack: the song’s pacifying effect feels slightly external rather than agentive.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to shape communal grief—tightens from refusal to release, through nightly readings and carvings, culminating in the single-line stone that forecloses monumentality. Agency clear; cost is the letting-go of fixed form. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal balance—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened each time Elara accepts another fraction of guilt. The final insertion of the handle is a decisive trade-off: personal absolution for altered mechanical balance, with audible cost (the chime). Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than causal turns, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation within constraint—is signaled in paragraph 3 and tightened when she refuses the “easy miracle.” Escalation is causal: each equation narrows the spire’s response until only the sustainable loop remains. Cost is visible: dull nib, sealed spire, unchosen paths. No coincidence; pressure coheres under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—crystallizing the emotion while safety dissolves—is signaled early and tightened by each ash-filled crack. One decisive turn: peeling the mask away forecloses the mirage. Cost is visible in bloodied cheeks and the swallowed name.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: proving memory tools matter. Escalation tightens via each historical layer that disproves the single-heroic-fall legend, forcing the costly decision to dig deeper. Closed arch: secrecy → gift → possible betrayal, with the republic’s hunger as living price.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—unlearning hatred—tightens via each subtracted noise; the Syrian/Yoruba braid is the decisive intensification that forecloses the old reflexive discord. Cost is audible in the “flakes of rust falling away,” legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—create beauty from ruin—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each pruning cut that trades nostalgia for future growth. Escalation is accumulative: every visitor adds a memory-seed, increasing density until the city itself is forced to dream green. The cost is the irreversible loss of the original greenhouse; no coincidence resolves. Agency remains Marisol’s graft and invitation.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—preserving wonder amid systemic collapse—is signaled early and tightened when Marisol must decide whether to trust the riddle’s promise. One clear escalation: the match strike awakens the tower, foreclosing the option of permanent blackout. Cost is legible in the irreversible metamorphosis of the bees and her acceptance of a new, uncertain song.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: teach houses to breathe without breaking. Escalation is accumulative—each sanctified object deepens the silence until the tide itself pauses. Cost is visible in the widow’s recognition and the noticer’s empty pockets. Agency remains hers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will the garden’s hope be rekindled—tightens when the ampoule knocks and Aurele chooses to weave memory into its fracture. Escalation is Accumulative: each revelation (garden as will, gardener’s intent, bronze tear) deepens the cost of welcoming nuance. Agency is statue-driven; coincidence complicates (tile falls) but does not resolve. The final image forecloses the path of eternal stillness with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—balancing regret via perpetual motion—tightens when the crack offers reunion yet demands proof. Escalation is one deepening: the staircase rearranges into the slope of her shoulder, forcing stance crystallization. Cost is the lost second die and the suspended instant.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake: can Mira rouse enough remembered kindness to justify her sleepless vigil? Pressure tightens as moonlight thickens and the brush begins to sing; each glyph is a visible cost of pigment and stamina. The final ascent of the glyphs crystallizes the stake without resolving it tidily—an Earned Stasis that forecloses her sleepless quest. Agency is continuous; coincidence (janitor’s arrival) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—the revival of living culture—tightens as bread’s aroma summons voice fragments; pressure felt rather than escalated; visible cost in abandoning old alphabets to communal harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“shatter what the world thinks inevitable”—is tested in each beat: stone warms, yoyo coils backward, beam stutters. Escalation is causal and irreversible; each tug narrows options until the stone is dust and the lighthouse forgets its own dawn. Cost is palpable in the erasing footprints and deranged beam.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—trick fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled in paragraph three and tightened when the protagonist must choose which reflection never dies. Escalation is causal: unbosoming → photo reversal → multiplying selves → black mirror exit. Visible cost: the advisor’s eternal imprisonment and the cracked mirrors that “fold like a mouth finally closing.” Agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—orchard survival—signaled in paragraph 1. Escalation is a single, deepening cadence shift: warning → carving → stepping onto branch → releasing chord. Cost is tangible: limes sacrificed, lashings tested, prophet’s heartbeat etched into deck. Agency drives every intensification; coincidence (cloud-whale) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—escape or acceptance—tightens when the crack widens and the lost expedition warns of inheritance. Escalation is causal: each whistle sequence narrows options until the mirrored chord forces the decisive release. Cost is visible—blood, trembling city, dissolving watchers. No coincidence resolves; agency remains Neris’s.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (rescue truth from the noble‐lie midden) is taut from first to final line. One meaningful tightening occurs when she shifts from passive excavation to active persuasion, etching cause-and-effect lines whose permanence will implicate present-day councils. The cost is real: the blood drop she deliberately presses onto the thorn is the same scarlet as the manuscript’s dragon—a price paid for the public she cannot yet address.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recording absence before water returns—tightens via each measured hollow and the ink’s finite drops. One decisive intensification: the inkwell absorbs absences and redraws the pavilion, foreclosing further mapping. Cost is felt in the weight of the inkwell and the dawn deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—truth of the library’s origin—tightens when the blackout forces analogue inquiry. One decisive deepening: the stamp’s magnetic turn reveals a third timeline, collapsing the binary histories. Agency remains Lira’s throughout; cost is the loss of institutional certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transform grief without erasure—is signaled in paragraph 4 and tightened by each crane; the cost is the cracked moonstone and the literal release of the memory. One meaningful deepening: the hundredth crane triggers the basilica’s shudder, foreclosing the option to keep the dream. Agency remains with Liora throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—locating and reclaiming unused potential—tightens through each calibration and orbital release. Agency is continuous: repurposing instruments, rerunning models, broadcasting coordinates. Cost escalates from private grief to system-level perturbation. The tightening is singular but sufficient; the drones’ silence answers with metallic cost.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—is signaled in the pilgrim’s first line and tightened when Lira risks burning her fingers. The final star-wink and open-parenthesis glyph force a trade-off: she completes the bracket, accepting perpetual itinerancy. Cost is felt but not yet paid, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    One rising pressure line: need for authenticity versus manufactured guilt. The decisive deepening—the photograph’s handwritten imperative—“tell her the truth weighs less than silence”—reconfigures stakes; Mara’s choice removes any future market for false lineages with public cost.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—recycling mistakes into wisdom—tightens when the cords stretch and snap; the price is the audible sigh of severance and the mirrored brass that now reflects only half a moon. Agency remains with Mara’s ritual design and the prisoners’ final exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering empathy after erasure—is signaled early and escalates as each headline forces confrontation with past victims; the rising water literalizes narrowing options, and the final rescue carries visible moral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reforge the bond or lose it forever—escalates through scent-awakened roots and the spirit’s ultimatum; the tightening is single but sufficient, forcing the irreversible metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—retrieve lost time before the birthday—tightens when the thread of light appears and proves untouchable, forcing acceptance instead of recovery. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens: density of traced hands and cracked porcelain reweights the cost. Agency remains active throughout; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the dimension sealed by unacknowledged grief—is signaled early and tightened through each stitched photograph. The final choice to dissolve the tear forecloses any return to the old silence; the cost is the irreversible loss of the relic and the irrevocable opening of the ship to unknown growth.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“understand the texture of transformation”—tightens through each jar opened; the final bug’s flight into the volcano forces the crystallizing choice. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve. Cost is the irreversible emptying of the jars and the permanent handprint in glass.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silent revolution—signaled in paragraph one and escalated by each mechanical bird. One decisive tightening: releasing the first bird commits her irrevocably. Cost is the permanent duplicity she must now live; felt in her serene face as guards pass.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“keep the stars from falling”—tightens when the tired star’s dust must be caught before it collapses. The protagonist’s agency is the stone-shift that stabilizes the vision; failure would scatter the promise and the star. Cost is legible in the jar’s weight and the mother’s final fade. One meaningful deepening suffices, and it delivers.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—turning censored wounds into public sky-legible words—is signaled in line 5. Escalation is one deepening: each rarefied fragment thins until “rain” alone remains, then the full poem erupts. Cost is visible when the envelope empties and the scars stay luminous on her skin. Agency drives every beat; coincidence complicates (storm) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—turning questions into destinations—tightens via each parry and needle shift. Escalation is Accumulative: pattern density increases until the card flip reweights the premise. Cost is felt in Lysandra’s relinquishment of secrecy and the envoy’s trembling blade. One meaningful deepening suffices; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“can beauty survive surrender?”—tightens when the warden’s torch deadline forces the clandestine archive and the molting clock. Agency is renunciation: Lark sacrifices continuity of self to seed future resistance. Cost is explicit in the cracked voice and empty pockets.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: reverse the departure encoded in the broken clock. Pressure tightens when compasses point to the booth, then to the single frame; the stolen moment must justify itself in live music. Cost is legible—timepiece destroyed, horizon deferred—showing the price of rewriting fate.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—protect cultural memory before the monsoon—is signaled early and escalates as petals forget lines. The dream-library summoning of witnesses is a decisive tightening that forecloses failure; the price is the lingering doubt she must keep alive.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—tightens once via the mist-given instruction and the compass’s new bearing. Escalation is accretive: each lace row, mist shift, and needle tremor reweights regret. Cost is visible in the swallowed compass and the relinquished student.


== Grader: Qwen 3 235B A22B 25-07 Think ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when Mara realizes the chrysalis decayed *in place*, deepening the erosion theme beyond initial wing collection. Agency in her spectral analysis shifts knowledge (gradual photonic loss > acute trauma), with humility as felt cost that alters her stance toward colleagues' "supernovae for spectacle."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through physical evidence: ledger → frost patterns → obsidian trail → kiln discovery. Agency-driven deepening when shard placement reveals truth; visible cost in tears blurring the image yet enduring the sight.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through Rowan's agency—fork placements deepen emotional translation—but the converging chord feels slightly unearned; room's response lacks causal link to his final heart-touch. Cost (frost retreating) is visible but escalation misses hairline precision for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake ("gaps in the ledger of the dead") tightens through accumulation as names appear, culminating in Elias writing his own—a meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens. Cost is unmistakable: physical (bleeding fingers), conceptual (his death), and tactical (library collapse forcing ascent).

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Mei-Ling’s agency (breathing across tear), reweighting "unused love" with felt cost; single deepening suffices for Accumulative escalation at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through agency-driven escalation: disintegration narrows options from physical to pure intention, with visceral cost in "skin flaking into light." Final dispersal charges the image, though retrocognition’s mechanics slightly obscure immediate pressure in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.6)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: wall collapse forces speed, guards' arrival narrows options to planting or capture. Cost unmistakable in "soil drank the gesture, thirsty as history"—conceptual weight of historical drought made visceral. Single tightening (ceiling buckling) suffices masterfully.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("violet said 'forgive,' indigo said 'forget,' but crimson screamed 'flee'"), but the protagonist’s discovery of the "hush" relies more on revelation than active agency-driven escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Internal stake (stealing vs. releasing beauty) tightens through agency-driven accumulation, culminating in the release ritual’s visible cost. Escalation lacks one incremental trade-off (e.g., fatigue or risk) during portrait captures to deepen the pressure before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (crafting safe zones for inquiry) tightens through map discovery, deepening agency from seeking to building. Cost legible in embodied thawing ("tears turning to steam") and abandonment reversal. Pressure accumulates via temperature rise without coincidence, though secondary stake integration could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (deciphering cast, rewinding film), but confrontation with twin lacks escalation—betrayal flickers but no meaningful trade-off precedes the burning, muting the cost's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Protagonist's eavesdropping and lens use drive escalation under Accumulative lens; "I altered figures for twenty years" discovery creates irreversible trade-off with visible cost in ledger corrections, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Lira's marble ritual (polishing as commemoration), narrowing options via the split marble's burial; cost is visible in the queen's physical reaction but slightly rushed in emotional escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: lever activation causes corridor collapse, forcing sprint with visible cost (nexus cooling). Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens—dream-songs' shift from "hush" to "flurries" reweights temporal fragility without causal shortcuts.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation tightens under Accumulative lens as Mara follows ripples into rising water while lanterns dim, narrowing options to perform the code; cost is visceral in the flood's recession and program's transformation, driven by her agency (tilting clarinet to spill the note).

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate texturally through accumulated error (margin notes, bleeding carbon copies) culminating in Elias' smudge—a protagonist-driven act that redefines the glacier's representation and pays visible cost (shifted logbook entry), fulfilling Accumulative lens with undeniable conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Mara’s agency-driven wheel rotations (137g → 21g), narrowing options with escalating conceptual cost. The dominant stake (measuring truth’s weight) gains visceral heft early, though Jonah’s off-page voice slightly softens the felt immediacy of the brotherly conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (witnessing without judgment) lacks escalation; no live option foreclosed despite "crumbling" cost, as keeper never faces temptation to judge—pressure remains observational rather than testing commitment under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through eclipse progression: totality forces Lila’s key shift to major, narrowing options to music alone. Cost is visceral (Rowan’s tear) and conceptual (Lila leaving the curl). Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, though "softly adaptive" slightly blurs escalation’s causality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (memory preservation) tightens through diary sequence, but displaced axis never constrains tactics—planet groans externally without altering Elara's choices, missing Band 8.8+ escalation requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (control over truth) escalate through Lin's agency: burning film rejects manipulation, proposing broadcast actively reclaims power. Cost is visceral (Mara's tears, altered mainland), though Mara's sudden shift from gun to laughter lacks sufficient earned friction under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate texturally: each loop pedal reversal ("inevitability excuses surrender") tightens the silence, foreclosing possession through rhetorical rigor. Cost crystallizes in the priest’s drained shimmer, but demon’s "I am the motion you refuse" lacks prior setup, slightly undercutting agency-driven escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (conducting unheard symphonies) tightens through her escalating mapping under dawn’s approach. Agency drives escalation: placing memories at precise whorls (2.7, 4.1, 5.9) narrows options as exhaustion looms. Cost is legible in "exhaustion finally touching her" at the climax, though the mirrored horizon’s role in enabling the resolution slightly edges on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: tablet's map forces confrontation with childhood wish, narrowing options to surrender. Cost crystallizes when gravity returns as "rush of blood and memory," altering her state irrevocably. Pressure tightens through procedural failure ("looping cracked marble") under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes signaled early ("numbness crept into her chest"), escalation via textural density ("reversed note peeled away numbness"). Cost legible in dissolved numbness and tears. Agency slightly passive but valid for Accumulative lens; minor deduction for backward method not dramatized in action.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stake (share/hoard knowledge) tightens through protagonist’s lateral movement and stone-shifting choice, narrowing options to delayed disclosure. Cost legible in "kissed it coolly like releasing a child" but escalation lacks visceral pressure escalation beyond internal calculus.

    Escalation driven by Arlen's decoding agency: each thread whisper ("You taught fear") deepens guilt until the king-tip reconfigures stakes. Cost is unmistakable in "breathed with it"—the village's first exhale mirrors his release.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate through Lysandra's agency as refracted stories multiply ("echoes... grew hungrier"), tightening the truth-vs-penance conflict. But guards' surrender lacks felt cost—they recognize hidden stories instantly without visible struggle, making the resolution slightly convenient under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake—"conjuring meaning from oblivion"—tightens via protagonist agency: narrating scars accelerates pressure as workshop shudders. Sixth crater triggers irreversible cost: statue dissolves, leaving narrator "keeper" with "quilt unfinished." Cost unmistakable in "dire enchantment deepens" amid golden seams. No coincidence; escalation pure Accumulative density.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (reconciling with departure moment) tightens via lagoon rising, forcing renunciation of the sunrise's permanence. Cost legible in pigment bleeding and shell's blankness, but escalation leans passive—water's rise feels environmental rather than protagonist-driven agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's agency through cryptic instructions, narrowing options toward "build the cradle." Resolution leans slightly on mystical convenience (bronze's moon-pull) rather than earned causality under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (orchard collapse) tightens through rain’s intensification and Lira’s planted eye, narrowing options to psychological safety as survival tactic. Cost is legible in "fragile grace"—endurance requires perpetual vigilance. Agency is Lira’s choice to plant despite skepticism, but orchard’s fear-sensing mechanism introduced late slightly softens escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through sensory accumulation as gaps multiply; keeper's agency in "pouring memories into vessels" forecloses solitude with felt cost in the flower's decay, though escalation leans slightly receptive under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency under accumulative lens (creek rising → ants → matrix chip) reweights the promise stake with felt cost, though the ants' guidance slightly edges toward coincidence without sufficient prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by queen's agency under Accumulative lens: the shared exhale narrows options to a single decisive act. Cost is unmistakable in the crown's weight shift, though the "three nights" timeframe could tighten tactics more explicitly during the climb.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through density accumulation (vials → shell → lattice), but the reversal lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Cael's whisper resolves the conflict too neatly; Liora's agency in "revaluing" feels reactive rather than earned through prior struggle with bottled time.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: placing the screw in the escapement reconfigures options, with cost legible in "almost smell" as permanent sensory trade-off, avoiding coincidence by making the screw's warmth an earned consequence of prior choices.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through breath-as-clock ("lungs burned; held breath felt like molten glass"), but the "rock plummeting" threat remains abstract without concrete escalation beyond Lira's internal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist's agency as chainsaws start during apology, narrowing options to metaphorical delivery; cost is unmistakable in "stumps glistened like open mouths mid-phrase" under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (ending cosmic division) tightens through dictionary's erasure and library's negotiable distances.

Spiral arbitration's luminous coils reweight pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through the horizon's failure and counting-backwards sequences, but escalation lacks protagonist agency; pressure tightens via observation not decision, weakening the cost's felt impact despite the conceptual repricing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (rigid defense vs. permeable invitation) tightens through the light lattice scene, narrowing options to diffusion; cost is legible in "regret loosening into spores," though the stranger's role slightly dilutes protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (reconciling grief with father’s philosophy) tightens through Mara’s agency: photographing scrawls, traversing aisles, roof climb. Escalation under Accumulative lens reweights "house edge" into "love disguised as time" with visible cost on the page (emotional vulnerability amid rain). Mid-beat pressure slightly soft.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Mara’s agency: disc loop intensifying forces her to apply her philosophy to herself. Dominant stake (transforming endings) tightens when she dials her own number, with visible cost in her dissolution. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten as jetty dissolution forces accelerated documentation, with agency-driven escalation in her refusal to retreat despite thinning into "annotation." Cost is visceral in bodily transformation, though the covenant's abstract nature risks making stakes feel less immediate than the physical dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten when Mara sends the stone backward through time, narrowing options from hoarding to trusting rumor chains. Cost is visceral in the "pulled tooth" absence becoming warmth, earned by ledger's blood-red balance.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (navigating uncharted emotional depths) signaled immediately and deepens through musical notes’ density shift from "silver droplets" to "melody that tasted of salt." Agency-driven escalation: her barefoot tracking and naming of grief narrow options to a single path with felt cost ("grief" as missing chord). Orion’s backward step crystallizes the earned reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: each edit ("unbending the lie") narrows options by spawning new sorrows, with visceral cost (planet shuddering, iron taste). Moral calculus between mercy/justice makes the cost unmistakable when "grief widened, more honest now."

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's escalating ritual (signing faster, submerging) under accumulative lens; cost is visceral in water-filled shoes and dissolving footprints, narrowing options to irreversible departure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes crystallize early: forgotten promise versus guilt. Agency drives escalation via painting choices that narrow options (e.g., final mirror rejecting pigment), with cost legible in "heartbeat... one throb per story" transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (memory ownership) tightens via drumming-to-lullaby cadence shift, reweighting options under Accumulative pressure, but serum threat lacks mid-scene integration to deepen cost before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Mara's agency—adjusting her gait to match Aquarius' rhythm narrows options to a single cadence, with the coin's heat/cold shift embodying the cost; storm pressure intensifies the whisper's spatial test without coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.9)
    Protagonist agency drives escalation: weaving shutters actively tightens the vortex rather than coincidence. Dominant stake ('teach darkness stars' value') deepens through conceptual cost when darkness learns the child's smile. Moral calculus sharpens the pearl moment—sacrificing silence for connection. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (books' unfinished regret) tightens via knowledge shift (regret → gratitude), but no live option foreclosed. Cost remains conceptual (library's contentment), never viscerally felt—baker/florist cooperation lacks resistance, leaving escalation passive rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten via live clock (sunrise vanishing), but internal/external conflict interweaving is thin—harbor’s "polite" surrender lacks concrete on-page test beyond Lira’s reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes deepen through "symmetry" revelation; single tightening ("melt from bottom") driven by poet's agency with felt cost (crystallized tears, shadow dissolution) under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stake ("find beauty in imperfection") tightens through three arrangement beats, narrowing options until the final trade. Agency-driven escalation: each "arrangement" deepens sensory cost ("painful and bright" memories). Unmistakable cost in "tears... slipped down her cheeks" charging the ivy dome closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (discovering connection's texture) tightens through protagonist agency: questioning assumptions deepens understanding until jar-opening choices narrow options. Cost is legible in renunciation of departure ("she questions the last assumption..."), charging the final image. Accumulative escalation—sound density increases (Bakelite laugh to tuning fork hum)—reweights stakes without coincidence. Moral calculus sharpens as she braids lost sounds into sanctuary.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes (grief vs. renewal) deepen through protagonist agency: reading coordinates aloud triggers the garden's manifestation. Escalation via Accumulative lens—cranes projecting coordinates narrow options toward tending the garden, with cost felt in "grief was a lens" realization.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: early "why had collective dream collapse" question deepens when cards show recognizable faces (landlord/coder), forcing Mara to confront value's migration. Cost is felt in "measured darkness" pockets—she trades prophecy for "new coordinates," with rain's slackening proving the city's irreversible reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten when historian realizes purification requires "subtraction," not addition; cost crystallizes in visceral "thousand small betrayals" as dominant stake reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate causally from shadow sighting to irreversible metamorphosis, with naming ritual as earned agency. Initial shadow description lacks urgency for top-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.2)

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (finding unused love’s storage) tightens when Mara’s singing cracks the "stale equilibrium," forcing the film to "flutter as if trying to rewind itself."

Cost is legible in "love unused is love still," reconfiguring meaning under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (freeing caged creativity) tightens via auroral intensification. Sextant's evolution from measuring tool to self-reflection device narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost ("snowfall" replacing struggle) is unmistakable but slightly abstract; visceral cost anchored in physical release ("animal waking inside her ribs").

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten when guard presses spark into clock—agency-driven escalation narrows options to cultivation versus preservation, with felt cost in recurring burning forest; secondary stake (dreams vs. sparks) lacks sufficient friction.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through sensory deepening (wind frequencies modulating from lullaby to warning) under the accumulative lens, but the "sixth sense" awakening lacks clear early signaling of its cost, slightly muddying the dominant stake's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation driven by textural deepening: the bolt’s "hairline crack" transforms the fortress’s silence from covenant to devourer, narrowing options to "carry the bolt down" or "stay until snow." Cost is unmistakable in "boots sinking into snow that tasted of salt and old songs"—a visceral price for memory’s return that reweights safety’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. fabricated history) tightens via marginalia pattern accumulation. Ink pellet application forces irreversible trade-off (end of guardianship?); cost felt in "innocence lost." No secondary stakes dilute focus. Agency-driven escalation under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate through Mara’s ritual deepening under Accumulative lens—tapping evolves from habit to permission-seeking, with visible cost in her transformation from data-keeper to witness who "logs no data".

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation via sensory accumulation (hum rising to chord) narrows options to transmission; cost legible in her run toward responsibility, though "lull in rebellion" stake could deepen tactical friction earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single dominant stake (tradition vs. evolution) tightens through Lila’s agency: decoding the kite forces a physical/emotional trade-off (painful retrieval), with elders’ resistance proving the cost of change is immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation via deepening somatic markers reweights the dominant stake (can grief coexist with hope?) with cost visible when her lungs "freeze mid-breath" then later "rearrange," narrowing options to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (memory’s ownership vs oblivion) tighten meaningfully when Lira weaves threads into a new pattern, but the "walls closing in" pressure remains atmospheric rather than a live clock that alters her tactics incrementally.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten as ink patterns escalate to a doorway, driven by Alba's agency (syncing drone, following trails). Cost is visceral in "faces frozen in expressions of eternal terror," but pressure lacks a meaningful reversal beyond linear pattern accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. survival) tightens through Tatiana’s agency: plugging networks "by proxy" forces irreversible scandal. Cost is legible in "red trails across plaza" and "alarm klaxons stunned." Escalation falters slightly—chemical trigger’s mechanics lack setup, making deepening feel convenient rather than earned under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Lila's agency: offering the rose reconfigures the scavenger threat into continuity. Cost is visceral in the boy's trembling hand, though escalation relies slightly on coincidence (his arrival).

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Lira’s agency (humming back, zigzagging) tightening pressure until goddess’s "tide of hush" forces irreversible choice; cost of surrendered coolness ("burning, walking resonance") unmistakably charges final image under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: her proof narrows options to mathematical intervention. Cost unmistakable in tasted iron and "smaller confessions" fragments. Escalation driven by her calculation ("subtracted drag coefficients"), not coincidence—fragments deepen stakes without resolving them.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through the Accumulative lens: "lilac unease" tightening into bruise-purple mist as the flake reveals "promise to forget love," culminating in visible cost of chalk worn to nub. Agency in widening the mandala forecloses verbal expression with earned renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake ("aberrant mercy") tightens through Leylah's blood-tessera reveal, shifting from observation to active repair. Cost is visceral in "empire burns more than rage" and the emotional labor of "fire-forgiven hands." Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens—no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through sensory deepening: coin’s thinning song warns of collapse, then echoes swell into ovations. Cost is felt in the minor-key chord and frost beneath roots, tightening pressure toward the dance.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stake ("illuminate hidden pathways") tightens through Mara’s agency: painting seams narrows options to the mirrored corridor. Escalation driven by somatic markers (knee warmth → rib hiccup) deepens knowledge with visceral cost. Child confrontation crystallizes the moral calculus between curiosity and scarcity, though the transition’s ease slightly softens pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen via emotional accumulation, but cost legibility falters—Lira's silent recorder implies loss yet "heart loud" undercuts sacrifice. Agency narrows options (not waking sleeper) but felt cost lacks visceral punch in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes ("spin prophecy before dawn") deepen through button placements, but "truth unravels" timeframe lacks visceral urgency. Agency feels passive; cost remains conceptual rather than felt in high-pressure beats like uncorking the jar.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (trust repair) tighten via protagonist’s agency: decoding snow patterns forces descent into unknown; cost legible in "unused courage" shift from "slow ember" to active warmth, though Mara’s arrival slightly softens pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when the woman reveals she’s “to unpick the knots,” forcing the coachman’s agency in offering the memory; visible cost in “gutters emptying” and the river erasing their wake reweights the dominant stake under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven purely by Mira's agency: humming with "rhythm of oars" narrows options from measuring sap to instilling light, with vulnerability as the price.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through stone circle's humming density (not causal turns); isolation→independence trade-off crystallizes with visible cost in abandoned library permanence; pressure grows via sensory cadence shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate causally: subsonic signal war narrows options to Lyra's phase-shift gamble. Cost is visible in her exhaustion and the comet's altered tail, but the inversion threat ("compassion into contempt") resolves too neatly without deeper communal consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (claustrophobia vs. discovery) escalates through narrowing corridors and sealed retreat, culminating in the organ’s reverberation—a deepening that shifts spatial perception. Cost is legible in mother’s ghost fading post-contact, though "spatial mutiny as memory" slightly softens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake ("never") tightens through pixel lattice entry and hitchhiker's fading, but escalation feels passive—magic systems (flake, scaffold) resolve rather than test agency. Cost legible in loss of hitchhiker, yet pressure lacks earned struggle against internal limits.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten when Mara reveals demolition—Leo’s fence-building forecloses departure with tactical cost (currency expended). Escalation driven by agency: money placement directly alters drone behavior, reweighting "loop" as generative not futile.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: Elara and Corin naming burdens transforms variable stars into fixed constellations. Cost is visceral—Elara’s "library of other people’s pain" pressing against ribs forecloses chronicling as isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist’s passive reception rather than agency-driven escalation; crystallization cost is felt, but pressure lacks active struggle against the paradox during critical realization beats.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten via the lantern countdown ("last lantern burned out"), but escalation relies on sensory deepening rather than narrowing options. Cost is felt through Miren's tears and sinking the key tag—a conceptual forfeiture—but the pressure lacks a visible tactical shift. Agency shines in her systematic exploration yet the "meaningful deepening" meets scope requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stellar doubt vs. enthusiasm creates authentic tension; one tightening (prophecy shift from "will have aligned" to "did align") changes knowledge decisively. Cost is visceral—dissolution charges the final beam. Agency drives every escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen accumulatively as each named monster reshapes the reaper’s understanding, but the pressure shift from "fear" to "sacrifice" lacks a concrete moment where this realization forces a tactical change beyond passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate through Calen’s agency: mercury-dripping to droplet rhythm narrows options to one impossible action, with visible cost in the bell’s breathing fracture. "Lukewarm" property shaping cooling method proves persistent constraint under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate from cracked buckle (immediate death risk) to atmospheric shear (operation-wide peril), but deepening lacks visible price paid mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.3)
    Single stake—defeating numbness—tightens through Kael’s deliberate jar-cracking, narrowing options to surrender. Cost is visceral: tears stinging like thaw, raw laughter slicing numbness, scaling perfectly to short-form pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by Cass's agency under Accumulative lens: radio patterns evolve from "Morse, then melody, then memory" to stitching timelines, narrowing options through patterned intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation through accumulation: each fountain deepens the cost (box growing heavier) and narrows options, culminating in the seventh fountain’s agency-driven climax.

    Dominant stake (understanding house-aliveness) lacks concrete opposition or escalation. Pressure accumulates through ritual but no palpable resistance; "cost" remains abstract (shard's completion) without tradeoffs during sanctification. Tide timing hints at live clock but unused.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.4)
    Dominant stake (welcoming nuance into certainty) tightens through revelation density under Accumulative lens. Aurele's agency in naming "accommodation" forecloses rigidity with felt cost ("structural weakness—awaits thread"), avoiding coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (capturing missed opportunity texture) tightens when equations spill across risers, narrowing options to mathematical proof. Cost legible in "steps sliding like pistons to close the gap," though escalation leans slightly heavy on accumulation over protagonist agency in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: each glyph stroke deepens the saffron hush, narrowing options toward proof. Visible cost in brush disintegration, though "methodically hopeful" trait lacks mid-beat testing until janitor's testimony.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through deepening: Lysandra’s failed lens alignment ("reflecting her own iris ringed with dread") forces realization that culture "must be broken and shared". Cost is visceral—the city’s "ice to the touch" thawing into "dripping stalactites in counterpoint". Amara’s recipe drives the turning point without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Marrow's agency—splicing stone into axle narrows options to "one potential flashing forward." Cost ("sea birds forget how wings fold") is visceral, but "cosmic grain" phrasing risks abstracting the conflict slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: unbosoming fears directly triggers the reflections' advance under accumulative pressure. Cost crystallizes visibly when the Polaroid shows the trapped advisor—conceptual price paid for refusing the frame. Dominant stake (escaping recursive fear) tightens via one decisive deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: prophet's dubbing transforms dissonant glass into harmony, foreclosing escape path with felt cost (physical/emotional strain); escalation driven by heartbeat-rhythm grooves reweights survival as artistic creation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Neris's agency alone: her sound-mapping leads to crack discovery, glyph melody, and the resonant chord. Cost is unmistakable—blood on the reed and stirred turtles—though the escalation from "charting micro-eddies" to world-altering resonance slightly outpaces mid-beat causality.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation deepens through protagonist agency: arranging scraps into a spiral transforms knowledge, narrowing options to persuasion, with cost legible in her blood and the wind’s "hollow echoes" mistaken for truth.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate via environmental pressure (drawbridge descent deadline) narrowing options, but protagonist agency in driving escalation feels secondary to atmospheric forces, missing the high-band requirement for decisive protagonist-led tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by Lira's agency: testing the stamp's rotation, descending to vault with marlinspike. Dominant stake (truth vs. certainty) tightens when blackout erases digital indices, forcing analog verification. Cost unmistakable as lights threaten to "overwrite doubt," but single pressure point limits escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes signaled immediately via "satchel of grief heavier than any lantern"; escalation through ritual deepening narrows options to transformation. Cost unmistakable in meaning-shifted weight; agency drives every beat (polishing, folding, accepting sketch). One tightening suffices for Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Protagonist's agency tightens stakes via perturbation amplitude escalation, forcing trade-offs (time vs. unsanctioned grief) with visible cost in the "surgical" vision cut; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen when Lira realizes drone sought "resonance that would make every place home," not coordinates. This reconfiguration forecloses physical destination with visceral cost (pilgrim’s vanishing, observatory’s darkness), though escalation leans slightly thematic in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Mara's agency (imposing "no apology" rule) and the boy's mid-walk reversal; cost is unmistakable in the cords snapping like a sigh after his vulnerable declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative escalation intensifies through labyrinth path choices: each step echoes silenced voices, narrowing options via living stone walls pressing close; cost legible in protagonist’s shame-doubled route and hollow blooming with emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes escalate via sensory density under Accumulative lens: the spirit’s ultimatum ("I cannot stay unless you finish") forces Ayla’s agency to deepen the metamorphosis, with humanity’s surrender making cost viscerally legible in "become creature of orchard and moon."

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation through Accumulative lens succeeds as each stitched photograph intensifies grief-density until the tapestry lifts; cost is visceral in "tear dissolved into Kwan Yin’s Tear, doubling its glow"—but shadow work concept remains slightly abstract despite corridor revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: each bug release deepens Mara’s realization with felt cost (abandoning linear giving). Agency clear in deliberate releases; cost crystallizes when she understands "giving was not subtraction but translation". Single deepening sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.7)
    Blackout’s time pressure tightens decisively via sundial coordinates ("seventeen clicks left"), but urgency lacks visceral escalation—cost feels conceptual rather than immediate. Agency strong in Lira’s choices, though blackout’s origin remains untested pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (saving stars) tightens when mother specifies "that one is tired," forcing protagonist's agency in stone adjustment. Cost ("vision folds back") is felt but lacks tangible consequence; escalation leans slightly passive during vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through poet's agency (rarefying "rain" fragment), but escalation leans on atmospheric pressure rather than protagonist-driven trade-offs; conceptual cost (words rarefied into atmosphere) legible yet passive.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Lysandra’s agency: shifting needle IX to "listen" forces envoy’s concession, then flipping the card reveals the overture, crystallizing their stance. Conceptual cost ("questions grown tired of asking") is unmistakable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten when Mira reveals "warden will torch annex," forcing Lark's agency in "tonight we bloom." Pressure grows via moon's descent (triggering molting) and time-sensitive book rescue. Cost legible in Lark's physical fracture ("voice cracking") and forsaking identity stability.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by pianist's agency (threading film, stealing frame) under Accumulative lens; cost legible when clock "exploded quietly" as he rewrites departure. Horizon's "indigo blade" tightening stakes fulfills band guardrails for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Mira's agency: interpreting orchid dream → summoning witnesses under monsoon pressure; cost crystallizes in "luminous doubt flickering" as she endures with protected-but-fragile memory.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative pressure as the mist’s instructions ("gather sky after you have left it untouched") reweight Helini’s options, but her passive reception of the lace’s guidance ("instructions appeared") undercuts protagonist-driven escalation. Cost is felt in the bonsai’s transformation, yet the ritual’s mechanics rely on atmospheric inevitability over active choice.
