    Stakes center on Elara's personal transformation from drama-stripping to meaning-finding. The dust experiments provide gradual deepening rather than reversals, appropriate for the Accumulative lens. While the butterfly emergence reweights prior material, the lack of visible trade-offs or foreclosed paths limits the score—Elara gains insight without sacrificing anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on uncovering truth and finding the apprentice, signaled early through the ambush aftermath. The investigation tightens through discovered caches leading to the grotto revelation. But escalation remains steady rather than pressurized—no immediate threats or time constraints force difficult trade-offs, and the discovery unfolds without meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled early but escalation is minimal. Kael's arrival introduces new information but doesn't force a difficult choice or trade-off. The discovery of "a rhythm in the silence" feels convenient rather than earned through protagonist agency, and no visible price is paid.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake - completing the lens to send a final distress signal - progresses through fragment collection, but escalation remains mechanical rather than costly. Each discovered piece brings Elias "closer to understanding" without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options; the resolution arrives through completion rather than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.6)
    The widow's discovery provides one genuine tightening moment that forces Mara to reveal herself. However, escalation plateaus after this - the gathering succeeds without opposition or trade-offs. The stakes (building intergenerational support) remain abstract rather than viscerally tested through concrete obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of finding "where unused love is stored" remains abstract throughout, never tested through concrete opposition or trade-off. Elara follows sparks, finds pendant, places it in statue, receives healing—a sequence without meaningful resistance or cost that would force her to choose between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding time's texture through the halo fragment—experiences minimal escalation. The maze shifts geometry and the fragment grows warmer, but these intensifications don't narrow Elara's options or force trade-offs. The resolution arrives through the fragment's dissolution without Elara facing a meaningful choice between competing goods or accepting a visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clear (retrieve seeds before wall collapses) with time pressure and pursuing enemies creating escalation. However, the liberator succeeds without meaningful trade-offs - they get the seeds, escape unharmed, and even lose their chains without cost. The resolution feels too clean for the established danger.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the sound of trust breaking—remains consistent but static until the forge scene. The single meaningful deepening occurs when Elara experiences the sound "not in her ears, but in her chest," forcing internal reconfiguration. However, no external opposition or complication tests her commitment; she simply executes her plan without meaningful resistance or cost beyond the emotional revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—seeking illumination/destiny—is signaled early but lacks genuine escalation. The flower trap provides minimal obstacle (Lira solves it immediately), and Elara's appearance shifts from potential conflict to instant resolution. No meaningful cost or trade-off occurs; Lira receives exactly what she sought without sacrifice or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—creating "safe zones for inquiry"—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. Elara works alone without obstacles, internal or external, that would force trade-offs. The melting ice provides thematic resonance but no actual pressure on her choices. No reversal or tightening occurs; she simply completes her intended task without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake of reclaiming identity is signaled early and maintained, with one meaningful tightening when Elara discovers the key. However, escalation relies on magical convenience (the seashell suddenly glowing and guiding) rather than protagonist-driven choices, and the antagonist remains entirely abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on the oracle's attempt to "draw a map of an endless night," with escalation through accumulated stories that deepen the silence. However, no genuine opposition or cost emerges—each story adds texture without forcing trade-offs or narrowing options, and the oracle achieves their goal without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake—understanding consciousness origins—maintains focus but lacks escalating pressure. The violin playing triggers visions but there's no resistance, no meaningful tightening where Unit-7 must sacrifice or risk something tangible. The "cost" of the second chance program is mentioned but never dramatized as actual loss or trade-off during the transcendent sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake (repairing trust with Kian) is clear from paragraph two. Tension builds through Elara's internal deliberation and her decisive action of creating/offering the doodles. However, the conflict lacks meaningful resistance—Kian's immediate acceptance deflates potential pressure, and no visible price is paid for the reconciliation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias proving his worth to himself through the garden—develops through accumulation rather than escalating pressure. The marble-polishing ritual creates textural density but lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes are declared (proving the theory, station stability) but lack visceral pressure. The crisis resolves too easily through Elara's recall of mentor wisdom and lever adjustment—no genuine trade-offs or irreversible consequences. The conflict peaks and resolves within paragraphs without forcing difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the ghost composer's unfinished work—progresses through Clara's interpretation of water-damaged patterns to humming the melody, creating modest escalation. The ghost's appearance on stage provides visual pressure but the resolution lacks tangible cost; Clara gains understanding and peace without sacrificing anything concrete or facing a genuine choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—finding clarity about the "swallowed truth"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The smudging of the illustration provides one concrete tightening moment that forces a choice between restoration and transformation. However, the truth's specific weight never materializes, and the wanderer's arrival feels coincidental rather than earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (finding truth about father/ghost shift) is signaled early and escalates from exploration to confrontation, but the tightening lacks genuine cost—shadows that "lunged" create momentary tension without lasting consequence. The resolution through turning the valve feels too easy; no trade-off or sacrifice required beyond brief hesitation. Agency exists but the opposition dissolves without extracting meaningful price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving balance between witnessing and becoming—escalates through the swan's trembling, the map revelation, and the mirror confrontation, with visible cost in the refuge's erasure. However, Lira's agency remains somewhat passive during the transformation sequence ("felt her mind unravel"), and the mystical resolution lacks the concrete pressure that would push into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.9)
    The eclipse provides temporal pressure and Finn's fear creates initial tension, but escalation remains gentle throughout. The story deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, with the hair curl's glow and shared hand-holding building toward Finn's perspective shift. Stakes stay modest—a boy's relationship with wonder—without significant cost or resistance to the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes are declared (restoring world's dreams) but never tested through opposition or meaningful choice. The escalation follows a treasure-hunt pattern without resistance - each discovery leads smoothly to the next. No visible price is paid; Elara's success costs her nothing personal or tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.2)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - Li Wei moves from writing fortunes to planning a journey without encountering resistance or paying a price. The dominant stake (unveiling open secrets) remains abstract and untested. The story declares transformation ("conductor of fate") without dramatizing the pressure that would force such a change.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—stopping the possession before it completes—is signaled early but escalation remains abstract through rhetorical questions rather than concrete pressure. The possession grows "stronger" and "more insistent" but these intensifiers lack causal triggers. The final confrontation resolves through declaration rather than earned cost, with the possession simply dissolving when assumptions are exposed.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: memory-mapping intensifies to inscription, then to the whispered activation of the harp. The dawn deadline creates genuine urgency. However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract—what specifically is lost if the symphony isn't conducted remains unclear, limiting the felt cost of the writer's collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal understanding to embracing all timeline versions, with the tablet's dimming light providing urgency. The cost appears in Elara's recognition that each path shapes her. Yet the timeline encounters lack concrete pressure—the hollow-eyed destructive version poses no actual threat, and transitions between paths feel frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of defeating numbness is clear, with one meaningful deepening as reversed songs awaken emotions. However, escalation reads more as accumulation of sensory details than rising pressure—colors brighten, air sharpens, emotions surface sequentially without resistance or complication that would create true conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to larger threat, but the tightening lacks agency—Elias discovers information rather than making choices that narrow options. The "storms are not natural" revelation raises stakes abstractly without forcing a concrete trade-off or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (confronting suppressed grief) signals early through "aromatically cautious choices." The vial creates meaningful escalation as Elias moves from hesitation to purchase to use, with each memory scene tightening emotional pressure. Final acceptance carries visible cost in tears, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: pattern recognition leads to mirror discovery, then to the tripartite vision forcing a stance. The choice to place the rope carries weight as abandoning his "lifeline." However, the stakes remain somewhat abstract—"discovering the texture of time" never faces concrete opposition or risk beyond existential uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - breaking the "chronic hush" - is signaled early and deepens through Elara's discovery of the bowl and decision to play. The escalation from hesitation to playing to speaking shows clear accumulative pressure, though the resistance feels minimal and the transformation perhaps too easily won.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake - crafting an impossible emotion of "joy without attachment" - is clear and develops through Elara's realization of Kael's deeper fear. The transformation sequence provides escalation, but the conflict remains largely internal without strong external pressure or meaningful reversals that would elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=4.6)
    No meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens - the correspondence develops linearly without deepening pressure or forcing trade-offs. The "risk" of meeting in person carries no stakes since both parties are eager. No visible price paid for connection.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on belonging, with escalation through Lira's expanding search from orchard to settlements. The final recognition provides closure but lacks a decisive trade-off or visible price beyond time invested - the resolution comes too easily through Echo's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—Mara's need to revitalize her art by understanding time—develops through accumulating pressure as the pendant guides her journey. The giant's nap creates temporal urgency, and she must leave the Heart before it seals. However, the journey lacks meaningful opposition; everything aligns to help her, and the transformation comes without significant trade-offs beyond accepting she can't possess time.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about glass eyes to discovering the mentor's journal to confronting his warning about "unraveling the very fabric of emotion itself." However, Elara faces no genuine opposition or cost—she simply succeeds where her mentor failed without dramatized struggle. The "buried optimism" and determination feel unearned without visible price or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake of "becoming visible" is signaled early but never faces genuine test or complication. The discovery of tape fragments provides texture rather than escalating pressure—each fragment adds information without narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. No meaningful reversal occurs; the protagonist's motivation "burned brighter" represents intensification without cost.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—Mara's need for control versus transformation—remains internal without external pressure testing it. No concrete opposition forces choices; the storm is atmospheric rather than antagonistic. The "reluctant metamorphosis" proceeds through declaration ("she knew what she had to do") rather than dramatized struggle with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elara's search for artistic meaning, which escalates through discovery (brooch→map→exchange location) but lacks genuine obstacles. The old woman's appearance feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle. While the exchange reweights Elara's purpose, no competing force tests her commitment or extracts meaningful cost.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract—seeking "answers" about her failed clairvoyance never crystallizes into specific consequences. The transformation lacks genuine opposition or cost; Elara gains cosmic understanding without sacrificing anything concrete or facing real resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake of recovering and preserving lost stories is signaled early. Escalation occurs through the trumpet's activation and the woman's appearance, though these feel more like revelations than earned pressure points. The "navigated absences" concept creates thematic tension but lacks concrete opposition or trade-offs that would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from external mystery to internal confrontation, with the punch-the-ticket decision crystallizing agency. The "trembling certainty" builds appropriately. Yet the conflict lacks intermediate resistance—Elara follows arrows without obstacle, and the fortress test feels abstract rather than dramatically costly.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need for connection versus skepticism—develops through the tile's escalating revelations. The tower climb provides physical pressure, but agency remains largely passive as visions happen to her rather than through her choices. Cost appears in her worldview shift but lacks immediate trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal ennui to dimensional rebellion with the fragment's power growing from "faint hum" to "resonant drone." The mutiny creates genuine pressure as "dimensions colliding in chaotic symphony." But agency feels thin—Elyr simply "pressed on" without facing trade-offs or narrowed options that would deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (finding honest survival vs. continuing schemes) develops through Clara's growing resistance, culminating in her confrontation. The ink pot moment provides textural deepening but lacks clear causal pressure. Cost appears as the father's "controlled frustration" melting to acceptance, though the practical implications remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.3)
    While the hum intensifies and "calls" to Elara, creating a form of escalation, the stakes remain abstract throughout. The story lacks concrete opposition or cost—Elara simply receives the vision without struggle, trade-off, or meaningful choice. The "trembling hands" suggest intensity but don't translate to actual consequence or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.0)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered discoveries—label, fragments, archives, letter—but lacks meaningful tightening or deepening that would foreclose options. The wanderer faces no resistance or trade-offs; they simply collect and continue. The dominant stake of uncovering erased histories progresses without cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—decoding the grandfather's riddle—tightens as Mara's cello playing intensifies and the seashell begins to glow, forcing her to confront the ephemeral nature of her quest. The cost is legible when she accepts there's no concrete artifact to find, though the escalation relies more on accumulation of atmosphere than decisive turns.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes center on privatization threatening community identity, signaled early through gentrification warnings, but escalation plateaus—Vorin's opposition amounts to dismissive words without concrete obstruction. The festival resolution arrives without meaningful cost; community unity manifests without anyone sacrificing or choosing between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes escalate from professional duty to personal memorial to defying mission control, with time pressure mounting. However, the tightening lacks genuine trade-offs - Elara never faces a real cost for staying longer. The "outlast the dawn" directive creates urgency but resolution comes without meaningful sacrifice beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring the drone to rebuild trust—is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. The repair proceeds methodically without setback, reversal, or meaningful choice between competing goods. The ship's anchor lifting provides atmospheric parallel but doesn't create pressure on Elara's task.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding where rivers begin—is established early and maintains coherence through the discovery sequence. However, escalation is minimal: Elara simply walks outside, notices thin ice, follows mist, and finds the source without meaningful obstacles or tightening pressure that would force difficult choices or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake of town revival never faces genuine opposition or complication—Elias simply walks and the town responds. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ritual proceeds without setback, adaptation, or escalating difficulty. The resolution arrives through persistence alone without any visible price paid or path foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (survival via limited oxygen) is abandoned halfway through without resolution, replaced by discovery stakes that never face concrete opposition. The vial solves problems without creating new complications or forcing meaningful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal redemption to understanding the guards' disappearance as "offerings" to the lighthouse's power. The journal revelation narrows Elias's options between repeating his father's path or forging new ground. Yet the final hovering and decision to tell truth lacks immediate dramatic pressure—the urgency of "before they found the bodies" dissipates without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake (freedom vs. debt) is signaled early but escalation under the accumulative lens is limited - the bead glows stronger and other spirits appear, but these developments don't meaningfully tighten pressure or force trade-offs. The ghost bride's agency remains passive observation rather than decisive action that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=3.6)
    No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs - Elara encounters "remnants" and "relics" but these are "not obstacles but inspirations." The story explicitly refuses conflict: every potential complication becomes fuel for her work without resistance. No options narrow, no pressure builds, no trade-offs emerge.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=4.9)
    While the dominant stake of rebuilding faith is signaled early, escalation remains minimal—Elara encounters no meaningful resistance or complication during her weeks of searching. The discovery unfolds too conveniently: roots shift to guide her, the sundial base fits perfectly, the chamber opens easily. No concrete cost or trade-off occurs on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.1)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—"uncovering stories hidden between the lines" never faces concrete opposition or cost. The supposed urgency ("time was running out; the letter was due to be mailed before dawn") deflates immediately when she simply takes the letter without consequence. No meaningful escalation occurs; discovery proceeds smoothly from chalk to mailbox to letter.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—protecting the observatory's cosmic connection—escalates from personal artistry to cosmic threat through Lira's revelation. The flame's pulsing and chart's shifting patterns create coherent pressure that forces Elara from passive observation to active synchronization. However, the antagonistic "they" remains vague, and the final confrontation happens through collaborative work rather than dramatized opposition, softening the conflict's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding and confronting unspoken apologies—progresses from general messages to Elara's specific letter, creating one meaningful deepening. The cost becomes visible when she confronts "regret, of love unspoken, of a moment lost in fear," though this arrives through summary rather than dramatized struggle. The spirits falling silent marks a genuine shift, but the resolution lacks the resistance or difficulty that would heighten the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—deciphering the child's message to preserve memory—is clear, and pressure accumulates through the decryption process. However, escalation remains internal without meaningful tightening; Elara faces no active opposition or time pressure that would force trade-offs. The "anesthetic" suggests physical cost but doesn't materialize into scene-level consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering artistic joy—is clear, but escalation lacks sufficient pressure or cost. Discoveries arrive too easily without struggle or trade-offs. The transformation from finding film to projecting images to painting lacks obstacles that would force difficult choices or demonstrate what Lira sacrifices for renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring lost art versus being restored oneself—signals early and deepens when the mural figures emerge. Escalation follows the textural lens as harmonics intensify from subtle hum to full awakening. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance; everything progresses too smoothly from discovery to resolution without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal mission (decode message) to collective survival (Lexicon infiltrated and hunted). The revelation that Tax Collectors have breached their ranks forces immediate action—"Tonight, we fight back." However, the protagonist's agency remains reactive; he follows Dr. Krane's lead rather than making a costly choice that forecloses options.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—transforming pain into beauty—is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or test. No meaningful tightening occurs; the poet simply continues her work across time without obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs. The "shift" when the shell hums in response lacks causal trigger or cost—it's assertion without earned escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake of preserving forgotten names never faces genuine opposition or cost. Elara's journey lacks resistance - she simply follows the echo, sings, and succeeds. No meaningful tightening occurs; the shattering wind chime creates visual drama but no actual trade-off or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust with Kael—is clear, but escalation remains internal and abstract until the inkwell activation. The three promises provide structure but lack concrete opposition or complication. The resolution arrives through magical intervention rather than earned struggle, and the cost ("trembling hands," fear) feels gestural rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict between village fear and scholarly curiosity establishes clear stakes, with Elias's task providing agency through his design solution. The tension escalates modestly as he decodes the chain and discovers the blueprint's purpose. However, the resolution feels too neat—both parties simply accept his proposal without negotiation or visible trade-offs, and we never see the concrete consequences of either extreme option.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving lost songs while managing personal fragmentation—intensifies through the letter's arrival and subsequent discovery that "the songs are in the dust." This revelation narrows Elara's options and forces focused action. The escalation follows the accumulative lens appropriately, though the resolution feels slightly too neat without sufficient visible struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why some thresholds feel sacred—is clear from the start. The terrace's shifting and memory intrusion create pressure that forces Elara's realization. However, the escalation feels more contemplative than urgent; the "featherly determined" quality suggests lightness but reduces the sense of cost until the final gesture of leaving the logbook.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from seeking belonging to risking death for authentic connection when alarms blare. The facility's imminent collapse forces Elara's choice between safety and completing her firefly communion, with visible cost in her hesitation at the escape pod.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (recovering lost memories) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure—Lira attempts recollection, fails, then achieves partial success without meaningful obstacle or cost. The "path winding through a forest" appears and vanishes, but this doesn't force a trade-off or narrow options; she ends "lighter" despite the memory's disappearance.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—transforming monotony through orchestrated randomness—never faces genuine opposition or test. The performance proceeds without complication, reversal, or meaningful tightening. No cost is paid; the crowd simply watches and approves. The climax with starlight striking the bishop is purely decorative rather than a moment of genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes establish early (discovery means erasure) and pressure accumulates through Lira's ritual preparation and the approaching footsteps. However, the sentinel's withdrawal deflates earned tension without proper cost or consequence. The dominant stake of preserving memory versus erasure needed stronger resolution mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—illuminating value before change arrives—is declared but never tested through pressure. No opposition or complication challenges Elias's purpose; his meditation proceeds without obstacle. The "shift that was coming" remains abstract threat rather than concrete pressure forcing trade-offs or decisions with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—Elias's bargained innocence and survivor's guilt—is signaled early and maintained. However, escalation relies entirely on internal reflection without external pressure or meaningful tightening. The box's revelation provides texture but doesn't force a choice with visible trade-offs; Elias's transformation occurs through contemplation rather than forced decision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—finding "equations for hope"—is signaled early but remains conceptual throughout. The tide provides external pressure by threatening her patterns, but this complication lacks escalation; each wave brings identical stakes. No meaningful tightening occurs, and the resolution arrives through contemplation rather than dramatized pressure forcing a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream about—evolves meaningfully from curiosity to understanding to acceptance of purpose. Escalation occurs through the diary discovery and the film strip revelation, with cost visible in Echo's trembling fingers and the weight of inherited responsibility. However, the conflict lacks a strong oppositional force beyond the passive mystery itself.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—persuading mirrors to show possibilities—escalates through resistance and Elara's increased sacrifice. The cost is legible (fainter heartbeat), but the tightening could be sharper; the mirrors' surrender feels somewhat abrupt rather than hard-won through specific tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (ending the forever war) is clear from the start, with escalation through the grueling three-day negotiation to Elara's breaking point. Her vulnerable admission forces the leaders' choice with visible cost. The tightening is meaningful but relies heavily on summary ("Hours turned into days") rather than dramatized pressure points.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—undoing ecological destruction—remains consistent, with meaningful escalation as Elara moves from abstract guilt to concrete action. The cost is visible in "risking everything" and the "redemption she didn't deserve." However, the opposition feels primarily internal without sufficient external pressure to fully test her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (awakening the city from conformity) is signaled early and pressure builds through the untangling sequence. The threads create genuine obstacles requiring precision and emotional reckoning. However, there's no meaningful reversal or complication - the untangling proceeds smoothly to success without testing Elara's commitment or forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central conflict (ethical boundaries of art) never faces concrete pressure—it remains an abstract argument already resolved off-page. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elias's decision to change approaches happens without opposition or trade-off. The story tells us about stakes ("boundaries—about whether his shows crossed the line") rather than testing them.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=3.8)
    While the monarchs' dwindling numbers establish an ecological stake, this tension never escalates into concrete pressure that forces Elara to choose, adapt, or pay a price. Her art-making proceeds unimpeded from beginning to end without meaningful opposition or tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and maintained. The rope-weaving sequence provides textural escalation through "hours turned into days." However, no meaningful opposition or complication tests Elara's commitment; the conflict remains purely internal without external pressure narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain entirely internal and abstract—discovering "why paths choose walkers" never faces concrete opposition or cost. The storm provides atmospheric pressure but no genuine escalation. Foresight's work proceeds without meaningful obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs that would create tension.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—"secrets of the cosmos," "encrypted devotion," "covenant with the unknown" never manifest as concrete pressures. No meaningful escalation occurs; finding the tile happens easily through coincidence ("his fingers brushed against a hidden compartment"). The resolution lacks agency as Kael simply decodes a message without facing opposition or making difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.6)
    The central conflict—convincing Kael to release resentment—lacks concrete stakes or visible cost. We don't see what maintaining his resentment costs him or what releasing it risks. The single beat of resistance ("That was a long time ago") offers token pushback before capitulation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes center on capturing the "runaway dream" and are tested when Elara must synchronize her breathing with the cosmos to recreate the sextant. The pressure builds adequately through the restoration sequence, though the escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than decisive turns. The final boundary dissolution carries weight but lacks a sharp cost that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake of "bridging generational wisdom" remains abstract throughout, with no concrete opposition or tightening pressure—Elara faces only her own thoughts. The "breach of contract" exists purely as backstory without present-scene consequence or cost that would force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract—"pursuing forbidden knowledge" and becoming "heir" to stories lack concrete opposition or cost. No meaningful escalation occurs; the woman appears and explains everything without Elara facing a difficult choice. The transformation from bewildered curator to ready heir happens without visible struggle or price.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes escalate from finding the diary to solving its riddles to negotiating entry, with time collapse providing urgency through Kael. However, the negotiation with the guardian—the story's climactic conflict—is summarized rather than dramatized ("used her linguistic skills to decipher the guardian's demands"). We never learn what specific price she pays or what she risks losing.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—finding completeness through the garden/twin—intensifies as Elara reads the tangled narratives and her memories shift. The glowing card creates escalation by pulling her forward, and Lyra's voice forces a final choice between recapture and self-acceptance. However, the middle lacks a sharp reversal or tightening that would narrow options more decisively; the progression feels steady rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Elara encounters a puzzle and solves it without complication, reversal, or rising pressure. The "door shouldn't exist" creates momentary intrigue but never becomes an actual obstacle. The resolution arrives through patient work without cost: "her mind a tapestry of connections forming with every braid" shows only smooth progress.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake is clear - stop the chaos before it consumes everything. However, escalation is minimal; Lira follows the path, finds the bloom, activates it successfully. The "storm" provides ambient pressure but never directly threatens Lira or forces difficult choices. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (proving coincidences have meaning) is signaled early but the escalation relies on a single late revelation about memory sacrifice rather than building pressure. The cost becomes visible only at the end without intermediate tactical changes or failed attempts that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—preserving collective memory—faces no meaningful opposition or complication. Elara measures shadows, touches fog, receives visions, and continues her work without obstacle or cost. The story lacks escalation under any lens; the vision sequence adds texture but doesn't tighten pressure or force a choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake (defeating hopelessness) never faces genuine opposition or complication. No reversal occurs - Lira simply arrives and succeeds through her artistry without encountering resistance. The people's transformation from despair to celebration happens too easily, without earned struggle or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering time's texture—progresses through Elara's meditation and the cicada's transformation, but lacks meaningful tightening or opposition. The conflict with Kael remains offstage, and her discovery faces no active resistance or complication that would force trade-offs or demonstrate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.0)
    The gravity inversion creates a clear ticking clock that drives urgency, and Elara's meticulous preparation shows agency. The stakes escalate from confinement to freedom during the brief window. However, the conflict lacks meaningful opposition or complication—the escape proceeds too smoothly without genuine reversal or heightened cost beyond the risk of falling.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on Mira's need for refuge from chaos, with the storm glass vial tracking emotional turbulence as visible pressure. The gondola's course adjustment and arrival at the floating garden create meaningful deepening that enables her transformation. Cost is legible in her weeks of unraveling anxiety finally released.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes remain largely procedural - find stairway before sunrise - without meaningful opposition or cost until the abstract final revelation. The escalation through environmental puzzles lacks genuine pressure; Lira succeeds at each stage without sacrifice or visible struggle that would heighten the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=5.4)
    The encroaching darkness creates coherent pressure that forces Lira's choice to use the doorknocker ring, with the cost of severing a scar connection providing stakes. However, the darkness remains generic "suffocating presence" without specific manifestation that would heighten tension through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain abstract—"translate pressure into diamonds" never faces concrete opposition or forces difficult trade-offs. The transformation process occurs without resistance, and Elara's success comes without visible price paid, undermining escalation under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (uncovering family downfall) is signaled early and the gramophone scene provides one meaningful deepening when sound reveals the hidden journal. However, escalation stalls after the mystical revelation—Eleanor simply accepts the truth without wrestling with its implications or facing a concrete choice about what to do with this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—Alaric's need to find meaning after leaving joy behind—never faces concrete opposition or tightening pressure. The greenhouse "waits for his answer" but doesn't force trade-offs; the transformation happens through passive reception of visions rather than choices that narrow options or exact costs.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on Elara's need to find meaning through others' stories, with escalation through accumulated discoveries (button→name→letter→connection). However, no meaningful obstacles arise—each revelation comes easily without resistance or trade-offs, and the resolution lacks concrete cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes are clear—expose hidden history versus capture—and pressure escalates as enforcers close in, forcing Mara's adaptation to broadcast rather than escape with physical evidence. However, the opposition remains faceless "enforcers" without specific tactics, and Mara's solution (using the archive's communication system) feels convenient rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prophecy as antagonist remains entirely abstract—we never learn what doom it foretells or see its effects manifest. The conflict reduces to playing music until the problem dissolves without resistance or complication. No meaningful escalation occurs; the grotto's light show provides spectacle but no increased pressure or narrowed options. The resolution arrives without cost or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain abstract—"guardian of forgotten truths" and "bridge between past and future" never face concrete tests. The moonstone's discovery creates curiosity but no opposition or difficult choice; Elara simply researches and builds monuments without cost. No meaningful tightening occurs; pressure never forces her to choose between competing goods or sacrifice anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding versus control—remains abstract throughout, never crystallizing into concrete choices with visible trade-offs. The journey follows a treasure-hunt structure where each discovery leads smoothly to the next without genuine obstacles or reversals; the tinkerer never faces a moment where he must sacrifice something tangible for his new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding names' weight—escalates through Elara's confrontation with fear at the furnace, intensifies through the visions, and resolves with her acceptance. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as layers of meaning build toward the final reconfiguration. Cost is visible in the transformation from "luminous regret" to acceptance of ongoing search.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (gathering spectral confessions to heal fractured souls) is clear, but escalation is minimal—the figure appears, confesses, and dissolves without meaningful resistance or complication. The encounter lacks a tightening moment where Elara must choose between competing pressures or pay a personal cost beyond empathetic listening.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—discovering mercy's mathematics—lacks concrete opposition or escalating pressure. The forest "urges forward" and creates a "threshold," but no actual obstacles test Elara's commitment or force trade-offs before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal connection to the fragment through discovery of the map to uncovering centuries of lost stories. The dominant stake (honoring overlooked histories) tightens when Lila must physically navigate forgotten passages to reach the tower. However, no opposing force creates friction, and the resolution comes too easily without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of discovering hidden truths progresses steadily but lacks meaningful tightening. Marcus faces no real opposition or cost - the ghosts help rather than hinder, the barrel fits perfectly, the clock works immediately. The "weightless burden" never manifests as actual weight or resistance that would force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding reality's patterns—escalates from frost observation through whisper discovery to the choice to descend into uncertain clouds. The rupture in symmetry creates genuine pressure that forces Elara beyond her ordered world. Cost manifests in abandoning safety and accepting chaos, though the resolution feels slightly too comfortable despite the "lifetime to solve" acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (proving temporal plasticity) is clear, but escalation is minimal - Elara faces no meaningful opposition when accessing the sealed Hall. The "archaeological dispute" between factions provides context but no active pressure, and her success comes without struggle or trade-off beyond initial reputation loss.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of restoring stolen light is signaled early through the stranger's request. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias discovers the box is "tethered" and must journey to the Covenant. However, escalation feels mechanical—the journey and tinker encounter don't raise pressure, and the final restoration lacks dramatized opposition or genuine risk beyond the trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (finding what grandfather sought) progresses steadily but lacks meaningful tightening. The lagoon discovery arrives without sufficient resistance or complication. While the compass guides unerringly, there's minimal escalation of difficulty or cost until the final choice to let it sink.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes center on understanding the slide's secrets, but pressure doesn't meaningfully tighten—the archway simply reveals itself when Mara arrives. The GPS failure creates urgency but doesn't alter tactics since she navigates "by intuition and the faint glow of the slide" without demonstrated difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—recreating a dream cathedral—faces no meaningful opposition or tightening; Elara simply travels, observes, and succeeds. No reversal narrows her options, no cost appears when she completes the mural, and the conflict remains entirely internal without dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering buried truth—is signaled early through the encrypted diary. Pressure builds modestly through Elara's descent, ritual arrangement, and waiting, but the guardian's appearance and quick dissolution prevents meaningful escalation. The encounter lacks the tightening or trade-off that would foreclose options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central conflict—reviving a dead town—lacks opposition or escalating pressure. Elara's visualization sequence proceeds without obstacles, reversals, or trade-offs. The transformation happens through pure willpower without testing commitment or forcing difficult choices. No meaningful tightening occurs under any drive lens.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what the garden remembers—progresses through discovery beats but lacks genuine resistance or complication. The escalation follows a smooth revelation path (find shaving → play recording → decipher symbols → speak the language) without meaningful obstacles or trade-offs. The foghorn's silence creates initial tension but doesn't generate ongoing pressure that tests Elara's commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of borrowed time"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. The vortex opens without meaningful resistance (pressing the acorn cap immediately works), and stepping through involves no visible trade-off or cost, just warmth and welcome.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure accumulates through atmospheric shifts and the rope's mysterious animation, but agency remains limited - Elias mostly observes and reacts. The "zero hour" concept provides thematic weight but doesn't generate sufficient tactical conflict or force meaningful trade-offs before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake - understanding the lantern's purpose and one's role in cosmic stillness - develops through Lira following coordinates and meditating on falling stars. However, escalation feels gentle rather than pressured; the journey lacks a meaningful tightening that would force harder choices or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake of restoring the covenant lacks concrete opposition—Elias faces no meaningful resistance to his discoveries or ritual performance. The ghosts provide atmosphere but no active pressure, and the escalation follows a frictionless accumulation pattern where each fragment appears when needed without forcing difficult trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout - "maintaining the flow of time" never translates to concrete, felt consequences. The chronometer's erratic behavior creates initial tension but resolves without meaningful cost or trade-off. No genuine escalation occurs; discovering the device and activating it proceeds without opposition or price.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.0)
    Stakes remain thematic rather than urgent—the conflict centers on recovering an ability to see beauty, but no immediate pressure forces this choice. The kite repair serves as gentle catalyst rather than escalating tension, lacking the tightening that would foreclose options or impose real cost.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.0)
    The six-month terminal diagnosis establishes stakes but never tightens—Elias proceeds systematically without setbacks, urgency shifts, or moments where his limited time forces trade-offs. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; the orchard simply transforms as planned without cost or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout - "understanding the chemistry of homecoming" never faces concrete opposition or cost. The pilgrimage proceeds without obstacles, the amber discovery creates no conflict, and the resolution requires no trade-off. The encounter with another pilgrim could have created pressure but instead passes in silent acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming battlefield as garden) is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or complication. No tightening occurs—the coachman simply executes his plan without obstacle. The bird calls guide him but don't create pressure or force trade-offs. Agency exists but operates in a vacuum without resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—decoding the riddle's meaning—escalates from curiosity to active investigation to transformative understanding. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as details accumulate (leaf's warmth, shifting symbols, resonant hum) toward the revelation. The tightening occurs when "distance being translated into closeness" becomes the key insight, though the cost remains more conceptual than dramatically felt.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, the story builds textural density through Elara's sketching and perception of temporal threads, culminating in her realization about "true north" as dynamic rather than fixed. However, this deepening lacks tangible stakes—her isolation is stated but never tested against a specific choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (restoring the corrupted sky) is signaled early and escalates through physical ascent and mental chess challenge. The chess game provides meaningful tightening as each move reveals secrets needed to "amend the sky." However, the spire as antagonist lacks concrete opposition, and Kael faces no genuine losses or trade-offs that alter his tactics—his "sacrifices on the board" remain metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes deepen through walking ritual that shifts from external performance to internal recognition, appropriate for accumulative lens. The pattern-walking creates meaningful intensification. Cost emerges in relinquishing protective roles, though could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake - confronting buried memories to achieve wholeness - maintains consistency, with the stone's discovery providing the single meaningful escalation point. However, the conflict remains primarily internal without external pressure, and the "hidden thunder" builds atmosphere without creating genuine obstacles or forcing trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is clear from the start and deepens through the tapestry decoding and labyrinth navigation. However, escalation under the accumulative lens is modest—the pressure increases through pattern recognition rather than intensifying opposition. The resolution feels earned but lacks a visceral cost; "tears welled in her eyes" doesn't fully dramatize the price of her journey.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation - whispers become fragments, mist swirls faster, shadows coalesce - building pressure that forces Lira's final acceptance. The deepening from external poetry to internal surrender works under the accumulative lens. However, the transformation feels somewhat predetermined rather than truly contested.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory recovery to existential meaning-making, with the workshop's physical instability creating time pressure. The "between breaths held underwater" metaphor effectively constrains action. The cost is legible when the workshop nearly collapses. However, the resolution's ease ("The workshop, though scarred and aging, felt like home") undercuts the established danger somewhat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake - creating something timeless to keep her promise - is signaled early but lacks escalating pressure. The wrong turn provides coincidental complication rather than protagonist-driven intensification. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elara's painting proceeds without obstacle or trade-off, and the resolution arrives without forcing her to sacrifice anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts—is declared early but faces no genuine opposition or test. The vial cork creates curiosity but no real pressure; the woman's appearance provides validation rather than challenge. Missing the friction that would make the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes remain abstract despite the "reverse migration" framing - we never see what concrete loss Mara or the travelers face. The beacon-building provides activity but minimal tension since success comes without meaningful obstacles. The cryptic calls create mild pressure but resolve too easily into straightforward instructions.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—maintaining psychological safety through control—is signaled early and tested when the eye forces involuntary truth. The escalation from discovery to affliction to seeking help to ritual resolution follows clear pressure points. However, the conflict lacks genuine opposition; Mara provides the exact solution needed without resistance, and the ritual works perfectly on first attempt, reducing tension at the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulative discoveries—boot print, journal, memories—that reweight Elias's understanding. The pressure coheres under the textural lens as density increases, though the tightening could more forcefully narrow options at the climactic realization.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake of finding purpose/direction is signaled early and reaches closure, but escalation is minimal. The story lacks meaningful tightening—Elias faces no resistance, makes no difficult choices, and the doorway/guardian revelation arrives without earned struggle or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal mystery to world-balance responsibility, but this shift occurs through exposition rather than the queen's agency. The "lacy menace" and shadows pose no concrete obstacles—she encounters no meaningful resistance or choice-points during her climb. The dominant stake (understanding dreams) resolves too easily through the shadow's explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.3)
    The dominant stake of capturing/freezing moments never faces real pressure or opposition. Kael's instant understanding and trust eliminate potential conflict. The transformation occurs without struggle, trade-off, or visible price - the "directed spontaneity" happens exactly as intended without complication.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with fragmented selves to restore narrative coherence—signals early and deepens when the scroll reveals itself as "a map of her own mind." The confrontation with past selves provides one meaningful tightening. However, the resolution comes too easily through philosophical dialogue rather than dramatized struggle, and the cost of transformation isn't viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for meaning after sensory loss—deepens when the screw's significance is revealed, forcing her to confront how loss can sharpen other forms of perception. The tension between her curiosity and Mira's hesitation creates modest pressure. However, escalation remains gentle without significant cost or foreclosed options; the resolution feels more like gradual understanding than pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—overcoming fear through confronting superstitions—escalates from quill crystallization through storm arrival to final acceptance, with the "breath between storms" providing temporal pressure. However, the resolution arrives too smoothly; Elara's triumph lacks a moment of genuine risk where failure feels possible.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with her deceased grandmother before the orchard's destruction—is signaled early but lacks escalation. The conflict resolves through a single mystical moment without resistance or complication. The orchard's doom provides temporal pressure but doesn't force difficult choices or create meaningful obstacles to Elara's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain entirely abstract—"unifying fractured essence of existence" never translates to concrete pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs; the witness walks, touches a mural, closes eyes, and succeeds without obstacle or trade-off. The resolution arrives through passive reception rather than earned choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (understanding time's essence) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The counting sequence and key discovery proceed without resistance, and the resolution arrives through passive reading rather than choice under pressure—no meaningful tightening occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.4)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through sensory intensification (flickering light, humming energy) and the non-human footprints create genuine tension. However, the encounter deflates rather than escalates—the figure's philosophical pronouncements replace concrete stakes, and no visible price is paid for Elara's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs. Elara reads notebook entries, walks the aisles, returns to write—but these actions don't narrow options or force trade-offs. The dominant stake (understanding her father) never faces concrete test or opposition. The midnight clock strike is ornamental rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (Eli's isolation vs. connection) established early and deepens through accumulating calls that force him to engage despite his "cultivated estrangement." The escalation through increasingly urgent callers who share the melody creates coherent pressure. However, the resolution feels slightly rushed—the transformation from exhaustion to readiness could use one more beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake - preserving stories - is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elara's investigation proceeds without obstacles, and Mara's revelation arrives without conflict. The story lacks escalation under the accumulative lens - density doesn't meaningfully increase, and no pattern break forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (curing loneliness) is clear early and the clock catalyzes meaningful change. However, the transformation feels somewhat unearned—Elara simply touches the clock and receives her answer. The cost of her realization lands conceptually but lacks the visceral pressure of a harder-won insight.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—mapping one's own emotional depths—signals early and deepens when Elara discovers the stillpoint reflects internal rather than external terrain. The musical trail provides coherent escalation under the accumulative lens. However, the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off or foreclosed option that would elevate the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake (understanding/correcting the anomaly) escalates through Elara's entry into the void where she confronts fragmented time, leading to her decisive act of writing. However, the resolution feels somewhat convenient—the pen simply "responds to her intent" without earned struggle or visible trade-off beyond the abstract "weight of history."

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless through silence—remains static throughout. While Elara's energy depletes ("her energy spent"), no meaningful tightening occurs under the accumulative lens. The camera's unexplained click hints at complication but doesn't alter tactics or narrow options, leaving pressure largely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout ("rescue a forgotten promise") without concrete pressure that narrows options or forces trade-offs. The trail of clues provides momentum but no meaningful escalation—each discovery leads smoothly to the next without cost or complication that would test commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding and accepting the entangled memories—deepens when the lagoon reveals their true nature as connection rather than confusion. The shift from seeing memories as "labyrinth" to "bridge" represents meaningful escalation under the textural lens. Cost appears in accepting "collective grief," though the transformation happens quickly without sustained resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes center on proving "whispers travel farther than shouts" with the labyrinth test as vehicle. The map revealing new paths and Mira's challenge create escalation, though the resolution feels somewhat convenient—the key perfectly matches her lock without sufficient setup for why she possesses it.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—the stranger's need to release their "half-spoken secret"—emerges clearly but lacks meaningful escalation under the accumulative lens. The tension remains static as "stillwater" throughout, with the guardian's shutter-weaving providing atmosphere but not increasing pressure that would force the stranger toward their confession or transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.4)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Elias conceives his plan, executes it without obstacle, and declares success without showing actual transformation or resistance. The "humble rebellion" faces no opposition or complication. Stakes remain abstract (nurturing contemplation) without concrete cost or trade-off demonstrated on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake of self-acceptance develops through the scrimshaw discovery and whale's call, but escalation feels predetermined rather than contested. The "barrier of water and light" presents token opposition that dissolves too easily when Elara "let go." The piece lacks genuine resistance or cost—the transformation happens through mystical convenience rather than earned struggle against real obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—maintaining authentic grief under enforced happiness—is clear but static; Elara's whittling ritual doesn't escalate or tighten options, merely continues. The brother's loss provides backstory cost but no present-tense pressure that forces new tactics or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract ("transcend the ordinary," "dismantle walls that confined the soul") without concrete opposition or cost. The poem-recitation and ice-transformation lack resistance or trade-off. No meaningful tightening occurs; the poet achieves their goal without sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes center on Elias finding artistic meaning despite colorblindness, but pressure never tightens—the concertina's awakening happens passively "as if stirred by an unseen hand." No concrete cost appears; Elias gains musical ability and artistic validation without sacrificing anything, and the glassblower's approval arrives without earned conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering connection through sound—is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure or resistance. Elara's pilgrimage progresses smoothly from one revelation to another without obstacles that would force trade-offs. The "deepening understanding" lacks a tightening moment where she must choose between competing goods or accept a meaningful loss.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake (processing grief through creative work) is signaled early and deepens when the curtains respond to Elara's yearning. However, the escalation feels too convenient—the magical intervention arrives without Elara having to make a difficult choice or sacrifice, reducing agency at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to uncovering systemic manipulation ("It wasn't just a market failure...It was engineered"). However, the discovery lacks immediate consequence or cost—no forces oppose them, no difficult trade-offs emerge, reducing tension despite the conspiracy's scale.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—pursuing forbidden knowledge at the cost of sanity—is declared but never tested through concrete pressure. No meaningful escalation occurs; Elara's discovery of the worn pattern and whispered word encounters no resistance, and the resolution arrives without earned struggle or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes escalate from investigating grainy footage to confronting the materialized shadow, with Elara's "surge of luminous regret" marking emotional cost. The transformation decision shows agency foreclosing the path of destruction. Yet the physical manifestation arrives somewhat conveniently without sufficient pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—reconstructing trust and identity after betrayal—is clear, but escalation remains static as Elara moves through philosophical stages without encountering new pressure or complications. The single "shift within herself" lacks the tightening or deepening that would narrow options or force trade-offs; her healing proceeds without obstacles or visible cost beyond the initial wound.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake of finding closure/understanding escalates modestly as Elara moves from window to basement to cavern, with plants' whispers growing "urgent" then becoming a "chorus." However, the progression lacks meaningful resistance or trade-offs—each step follows smoothly from telepathic guidance without forcing difficult choices. The sand flowing "upward against gravity" provides visual escalation but no genuine cost.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is clear from the start, and pressure builds through the accumulation of discovered letters. However, the escalation plateaus after the letters merge; Elara's realization and decision feel contemplative rather than pressured, lacking the visible cost or forced trade-off that would deepen the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Lira performs her ritual exactly as planned without obstacle or complication. The "trembling needle" and "glowing archway" suggest change but create no actual pressure or narrowed options. Stakes remain entirely abstract (saving a "fading village") without any concrete test or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from finding the archive to discovering it's dying to enabling its divergent renewal. The charm's activation creates a clear turning point that deepens pressure. However, the resolution comes too easily—the clock simply works when held aloft without struggle or trade-off, missing the opportunity for a more costly choice.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Eamon's search for insight—remains mostly internal and abstract. While his translocations and explorations escalate, the resolution comes through placing the gear in the machine rather than through meaningful choice under pressure. The "colossal machine" provides resolution without prior setup or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure accumulates through the journey's stages (dock→boat→ridgeway→cliff), with each transition deepening Mara's commitment. The stakes remain primarily internal/metaphorical; the "unused courage" never faces concrete external test, limiting visceral tension.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (understanding the cost of safety) escalates from daily ritual through discovery to final choice, with Elias's playing representing acceptance of truth over fear. However, the middle section's revelation lacks sufficient resistance or struggle - the transformation happens too smoothly without enough pressure testing his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract—we never learn what specific harm the pretender causes or what Elara risks. The escalation through increasingly bold message placement lacks concrete pressure since we don't see the pretender's countermoves dramatized. The final confrontation deflates immediately when the pretender crumbles after minimal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=4.6)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Elara examines a page, thinks about it, then reaches an intellectual conclusion without facing opposition or narrowing options. The "pressure" of understanding the page's significance never forces a choice or creates visible stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared (finding meaning in defeat) but the pressure doesn't meaningfully escalate—Lira simply walks, touches stone, sees vision, gains purpose. No competing forces test her commitment or force trade-offs; the transformation arrives without opposition or visible cost beyond vague "scattered remnants" she must reunite.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (cultural restoration vs. regime control) is clear, with escalation through the unsealing ritual and guard confrontation. However, the guard's retreat lacks credible cost—"his resolve crumbling" without genuine contest weakens the pressure. The embryo's transformation provides meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.0)
    The photograph's near-loss creates a single pressure point but lacks escalation under the accumulative lens. The physical danger at the cliff momentarily raises stakes, yet resolution comes through convenient realization rather than accumulated cost—Zara simply "finds something different" without the density increase or pattern break that would justify her transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—recovering creative purpose through confronting darkness—is signaled early and tightens as Elara moves from paralysis through card-sorting to ascent. The escalation follows an accumulative pattern of deepening realization rather than external reversals. Cost is visible in abandoning the box and accepting the "luminescent ache," though the internal nature of conflict limits dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (understanding her brother's death through time manipulation) is signaled early and maintains coherence. The ink's revelation provides one meaningful deepening that changes Elara's knowledge and forecloses her path of seeking control. However, escalation is minimal—the confrontation lacks tangible opposition or cost beyond emotional acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to world-changing revelation as Elara moves from reading the letter to accessing forbidden data "capable of scandalizing the world." The ticking clock ("only moments—within the blink that follows surprise") creates genuine pressure. However, the resolution lacks concrete opposition or visible price—authorities are mentioned but never materialize, and the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.6)
    Kael's warning introduces external pressure but Elara's response ("I won't abandon it") occurs without visible struggle or tactical adjustment. The fortification work is summarized rather than dramatized, missing the opportunity to show cost through action.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early and maintained. Escalation occurs through the constellations freezing and the goddess appearing, with cost visible in Kael's role transformation. However, the conflict lacks genuine pressure points where Kael must make difficult choices; his zigzag walk and the goddess's appearance feel more like progression than earned escalation under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes are declared (exposing surveillance of dissidents) but never tested through concrete opposition. Eleanor investigates without encountering resistance, guards, or systems that would create genuine escalation. The director's "evasive responses" summarize rather than dramatize conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake of silencing guilt escalates through discovery of the letters, which forces Elara to confront her past directly. The cost is legible in her years of torment, though the resolution through letter-writing feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—discovering meaning in chaos—manifests through the mandala's response to the tile flake, revealing the grotto's buried truth. However, escalation occurs through passive revelation rather than Elara's agency; she asks one question then receives visions. The "choice" to honor rather than fill the silence lacks concrete alternatives or visible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract - "renaming reality" and "aberrant mercy" never face concrete tests or opposition. No meaningful escalation occurs; Elara works unopposed on the mosaic without encountering resistance, time pressure, or resource constraints. The conflict exists only in backstory and philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=5.9)
    The central conflict—luring possibility from despair—manifests primarily through symbolic exchange (the tarot coin) rather than dramatized opposition. While the garden "responds" and the despairing woman initially resists, the transformation happens too smoothly; the woman's shift from "hollow" despair to sparked hope lacks intermediate struggle or genuine obstacles that would create escalating pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake - understanding/healing the telepathy pill damage - remains abstract throughout. No concrete pressure forces Elara to choose or sacrifice; she simply works through the night creating art without opposition or cost. The "fractured minds and lost connections" never manifest as scene-level conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake - uncovering the caves' emotional history - progresses through fossil discovery and chamber revelation, but lacks meaningful opposition or cost. The fossil conveniently floats, leads her directly to answers, and the chamber opens without challenge; escalation occurs through revelation rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake - uncovering lost wisdom - is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition or cost. The echo simply "swells into a chorus" when Elara finds the right button without any struggle or trade-off. No meaningful tightening occurs; the prophecy emerges without Elara sacrificing anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake of reclaiming courage is signaled early and the codes provide coherent pressure leading to the letter discovery. However, escalation remains gentle—the letter's arrival feels like resolution without forcing a true choice or trade-off, and no concrete cost is paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the palimpsest promise—remains abstract throughout, never tested through concrete choice or sacrifice. The ticking gutters create nominal urgency but don't alter tactics, and the resolution arrives through the figure's explanation rather than the coachman's agency facing genuine opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain conceptual throughout—understanding "why places resist change" never faces concrete opposition or risk. No meaningful escalation occurs; Elara's discoveries unfold without resistance, setbacks, or trade-offs. The community healing at the end arrives without dramatized conflict or cost to anyone involved.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (finding connection/meaning) is signaled early but remains static. No meaningful escalation occurs - the meeting unfolds without resistance or complication. The "quivering hush" atmosphere doesn't translate into actual pressure that forces difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes are declared ("translate isolation into independence") but never tested through meaningful opposition. Elena faces no real obstacles—the library "tests" her but immediately yields to the sundial. The transformation occurs without struggle or trade-off. No live option is foreclosed with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake of "finding connection" never faces concrete pressure or opposition—Elara walks unopposed to her goal. No meaningful tightening occurs; the installation simply accepts her offering without cost, resistance, or trade-off that would create genuine escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from technical disruption to community division with Elara's counter-frequency as the decisive intervention. The dominant stake (preventing cosmic manipulation) drives action with visible cost in her isolation, though the trickster antagonists remain too abstract to generate maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake (finding the key to unlock spatial mutiny) is clear, with physical pressure from claustrophobia creating tension. However, escalation is minimal—she simply follows the compass, enters chamber, takes shard. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; her fear dissipates without earned struggle or visible price for overcoming it.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on solving Lila's disappearance, but the mysterious figure encounter creates only momentary tension without lasting consequence. The story's escalation occurs internally through Elara's realization about empathy's nature, but this philosophical deepening lacks concrete pressure that would force trade-offs or visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake of uncovering truth escalates through riddle-solving to the choice moment. However, the "restore or protect" dilemma arrives without prior setup, and the resolution ("chose wisely") sidesteps showing the actual cost or consequence of either option.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—uncovering what the hitchhiker sought—is signaled early but never faces meaningful opposition or cost. Bridge-Song's journey encounters only minor physical challenges ("air grew thinner, the path steeper") without genuine obstacles that would force trade-offs or test commitment. The resolution arrives through patient observation rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake - understanding why paths circle back - progresses through Elias's methodical exploration and discoveries. The journal provides meaningful deepening of knowledge about the startup's failure. However, the encounter with the scavenger lacks real pressure or cost, resolving too easily without forcing Elias to truly defend or sacrifice anything.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding inscriptions to heal fractured memories—remains static throughout with no escalation or complication. Elara observes patterns and makes connections but faces no opposition, setback, or meaningful choice that would narrow options or force trade-offs; the resolution arrives without earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate through deepening surrender: physical entry, mental unbending, then emotional confession. The vortex's increasing pressure ("thousand unseen hands") forces progressive vulnerability. Cost is visible in Eira's crumbling defenses and the confession she's avoided for years. However, the specific nature of what she risks losing remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are signaled early (mending the eclipsed covenant) and pressure builds as Elara navigates deeper into the maze. However, escalation is largely atmospheric—the maze reveals information but doesn't force difficult choices or extract visible prices that alter her tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's bound service versus freedom—crystallizes when the shadow-figure reveals the true nature of her bargain, forcing her to choose between escape and purpose. The roots' resistance and the appearance of her alternate self create escalating pressure. However, the conflict resolution feels predetermined rather than genuinely contested; Elara's choice arrives without visible struggle or genuine temptation toward freedom, reducing dramatic tension at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake (finding purpose after loss) is clear but remains static throughout. No meaningful escalation occurs—Elias moves from feeling empty to deciding to fill that emptiness, but without any tightening pressure or narrowing options. The internal shift happens through reflection rather than through choices that test his commitment or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.7)
    The dominant stake of understanding transition physics progresses through the seed's planting and growth, but escalation relies on passive visions rather than active choices under pressure. The transformation happens to Eliara rather than through her agency, and no meaningful option is foreclosed with visible cost until the quiet ending.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes escalate from routine cataloging to town-wide identity chaos requiring immediate intervention. The pressure tightens when Elara must stabilize identities through the pool ritual, though agency remains primarily observational rather than costly choice. The transformation accepts rather than resolves the change, which fits the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes evolve from bunker inspection to spiritual unification, with the crown activation serving as the meaningful deepening moment. The "heartbeat of hesitation" creates nominal time pressure, but Elara faces no genuine opposition—she follows the pearl's pull without cost or trade-off. The resolution lands through her acceptance rather than struggle, missing the foreclosed option or visible price needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake of finding self-forgiveness is signaled early but never faces concrete on-page testing—no meaningful tightening occurs as Elara simply moves through reflection to acceptance without encountering resistance or paying visible price. The stranger's appearance doesn't escalate pressure but rather provides convenient validation. The story lacks the required deepening that would narrow options or force trade-offs under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to cosmic responsibility as the protagonist discovers her role as conduit. The watch's backward ticking and library's trembling response create genuine pressure that forces her decision. Cost becomes visible when she must leave, knowing the library may close to her forever.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—weighing dream against empire—is signaled early but escalation feels mechanical. The Dominion scouts appear conveniently in the final third without prior pressure building. The violin's transformation resolves the conflict too easily; the scouts freeze without genuine struggle or tactical maneuvering from Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on Elara's need to capture essence before "oblivion claimed all," with one meaningful deepening when the traveler awakens and reframes her understanding. The shift from seeking sparks to embracing stillness narrows her options and forces a trade-off of her previous method. Cost appears in her trembling hands and the "tremor in her soul," though pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=4.6)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - Elara faces no opposition or difficult choices. Finding the hairpin, following a map, and touching a shell involve no risk or trade-offs. The mystical transformation happens to her rather than through her agency. Stakes remain abstract throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake (helping Mara overcome doubt) remains abstract and untested on-page. No meaningful escalation occurs - Elias simply listens to chimes, interprets them, and writes a letter without encountering resistance or complication. The conflict exists entirely in summary of Mara's off-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to reveal her discovery—develops through meditation and memory but lacks concrete pressure. The trance deepens and patterns shift, but no external force or internal urgency compels the revelation beyond Elara's decision "it was time." The conflict remains largely retrospective without present-scene opposition or escalating cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the arrowhead's purpose—progresses through watching bird patterns to internal revelation, but lacks meaningful tightening or cost. No opposing pressure tests Kael's interpretation, and the resolution arrives through pure observation without trade-off or visible price that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.1)
    The closing walls create immediate physical danger, but this arrives late (paragraph 3 of 6) and resolves too quickly through convenient success. The stakes shift from proving manual magic's worth to simple survival, then pivot to philosophical revelation without earned cost. No meaningful tightening occurs—Eli's first real test succeeds immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (discovering purpose/meaning) emerges late and faces no real opposition—Elias simply follows lights and reads books. No meaningful tightening occurs; the skeleton key's glow and the book's revelation arrive without struggle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate through textural deepening: from studying static bursts to distilling essence to submerging coins, each action narrows Lira's path forward. The "deafening and silent" burst marks genuine intensification. Cost becomes visible when "for the first time, she felt aligned"—her doubt transforms to purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning after loss—is clear, but escalation under the textural lens lacks meaningful tightening. The naming ritual proceeds without opposition or complication, and while the "echoes of sacrifice" accumulate, they don't force harder choices or narrow Elara's options.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract—"cosmic imbalance" and "the last fish" never create concrete pressure on Eliard's choices. The conflict is entirely internal and philosophical without opposition or cost. No meaningful escalation occurs; he simply repairs the bell without obstacles, trade-offs, or visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—recovering the town's forgotten identity—is signaled early through the "mirrored hush" and empty reservoir. However, escalation remains gentle as Elias faces no meaningful opposition or cost during his discovery, and the resolution arrives without sufficient pressure to test his commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake of harmonizing logic and intuition is declared but never tested through concrete opposition—Elara finds the crystal and achieves harmony without facing any meaningful resistance or having to choose between competing goods. No escalation occurs under the Accumulative lens; the density doesn't meaningfully increase, and no pattern breaks to create pressure. The transformation happens to her rather than through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.8)
    Stakes remain entirely abstract—"decipher the chaos and restore order" never manifests in concrete opposition or cost. No actual pattern-seeking occurs on the page; the resolution is declared ("The pattern finally revealed itself") without showing what was at risk or what achieving it required. The "watcher's burden" provides thematic weight but no dramatized pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (overcoming emotional numbness through integration) is signaled early but escalation remains conceptual rather than visceral. The "duel" sequence attempts to dramatize internal conflict but lacks concrete pressure points—each strike being "a question" and each parry "an answer" substitutes metaphor for actual conflict mechanics. The final shattering provides a decisive moment but the path there feels predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the seed's purpose—is signaled early but escalation is minimal. The transformation from seed to key represents one meaningful deepening, but Elias faces no real opposition or cost. His agency drives the planting and key-dropping, but these actions lack resistance or trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (restoring laughter) is signaled early but escalation reads as repetitive intensification rather than meaningful deepening. Under the accumulative lens, the story needed stronger textural shifts or pattern breaks to create genuine pressure rather than extended variations on the same symphonic metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake (return home vs. protect library) crystallizes when the keeper reveals the pendant's cost, creating a clear trade-off. However, escalation is minimal—the keeper appears without building pressure, and Elara's decision comes too easily without testing commitment. The phrase "I will wait" shows renunciation but lacks the struggle that would elevate the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—transforming failure into creation—escalates through Elara's shift from attempting resurrection to embracing creative destruction. The pressure coheres as she moves from passive despair to active ritual, with the crozier's transformation into seed representing meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in accepting years of failure as necessary steps, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake of unlocking the shard's power escalates through two realizations about silence and the shard's nature, with the lunar perigee deadline adding urgency. The cost of "discarding assumptions" manifests in Elara's methodical letting go, though the lack of genuine resistance or competing options limits the pressure—success feels assured rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes escalate from finding the ferry to merging timelines to resetting time itself, with Mara's physical deterioration providing cost. The warning from the transient creates a micro-reversal, but the actual rift-crossing and resolution lack concrete obstacles—Mara simply "pressed on" and "channeled energy" without specific challenges that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes escalate from weaving reality to risking self-unraveling ("trapped in this optical illusion forever"), with the shadow-man crystallizing the dilemma. The moment of connection provides meaningful deepening, though his sudden appearance and dissolution feel convenient rather than earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central conflict—preserving stellar navigation against Council decommissioning—establishes clear stakes but escalates through discussion rather than dramatized pressure. Elara's solution (blending old and new navigation methods) arrives without meaningful opposition or cost. The "weeks turned into months" summary deflates tension, and the resolution lacks the tightening or foreclosed option that would demonstrate genuine price.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—protecting a vulnerable voice from being lost—is clear and maintains coherent pressure through the accumulative lens. The escalation from faint whispers to clearer communication provides one meaningful deepening. However, the resolution lacks a visceral trade-off or foreclosed option that would elevate the cost beyond the conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal fear through environmental hazards to revelation about reality itself. The tidal changes create time pressure and Elena's claustrophobia provides internal conflict. The revelation about cables as "bridges to something older" raises stakes appropriately. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat - Dr. Voss's convenient presence deflates some earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding her existence after the death certificate error—remains static throughout as Elara performs technical tasks without facing opposition or making difficult choices. The "digital ghost" provides information but no resistance. No meaningful tightening occurs; the defragmentation process proceeds smoothly to revelation without cost or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (saving the dying language) is established early, and the curse creates nominal cost through physical drainage. However, escalation is minimal—Lira faces no meaningful reversal or tactical adjustment, simply progressing from entering to hearing to singing to succeeding. The flock of birds feels ornamental rather than complicating her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake (proving cryptid origins) is signaled early but never faces concrete pressure—Lena finds the arrowhead without meaningful obstacle. The garden's transformation and cryptid appearance create surface tension but don't force a genuine trade-off or foreclosed option. Her final "metamorphose" lacks visible cost beyond vague internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear escalation from playing music as defiance to actively synchronizing with the orchard's heartbeat, with visible consequences as statues advance and are destroyed. The dominant stake (restoring beauty/freedom) is signaled early and tested. However, the opposition feels somewhat passive - the statues don't adapt or counter Elara's actions meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate effectively from personal mission to patrol drone chase to the moment of delivery. The protagonist's agency drives the action through his cobbled drone and timing choices. Cost is visible in the temporary nature of the peace and Elias's ongoing isolation, though the middle chase sequence could generate higher tension.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake - transforming silence into possibility - is signaled early and deepens through the carpenter's journey to the oasis and eventual singing. However, escalation feels more coincidental than earned (stumbling upon the fragment, taking a wrong turn), lacking the protagonist-driven tightening that would create higher stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate through the geometric arrangements' increasing effects—scarf warming, air shifting, library trembling—building to the portal opening. The fading story-place creates urgency and Elara's acceptance of guardianship shows agency, though the return to ordinary order undercuts the transformation's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under any lens. The "strange" pulsing light and moving colors represent surface complications without raising stakes or forcing choices. Elara remains a passive observer throughout—she sets up equipment, takes a photo, paints over it, and experiences revelation without facing opposition or making trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (freeing the trapped idea) is signaled early but never faces genuine opposition—fear is mentioned but not dramatized through action. The vault yields after minimal resistance (one lock, one phrase), and the resolution occurs without trade-off or visible price. No meaningful escalation occurs under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=4.9)
    While the story shows progression from discovery to revelation, escalation remains gentle without meaningful tightening. The stakes ("recover stolen memories") never face concrete tests or trade-offs. The missing mushroom discovery and locket finding don't force difficult choices or demonstrate visible cost, keeping tension low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=4.6)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Elara simply performs her task without opposition or complication. The "combative tenderness warring with fragility" remains internal abstraction. The shadow "seeming to mock her" creates momentary tension but immediately dissipates without consequence or adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.6)
    No meaningful escalation or tightening occurs - Elara plants the seed and it grows without opposition or complication. The "radiant hush" moments attempt textural deepening but lack pressure that would force trade-offs or narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on grounding spirits while confronting personal loss. The net's increasing resistance ("particularly stubborn knot refused to yield") provides one meaningful tightening that forces Elara's plea for strength. However, the resolution comes too easily after this moment—the flood of whispers and subsequent peace lack sufficient struggle or visible trade-off beyond trembling hands.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—"bridging divides" and "interpreting silence" never face concrete opposition. The excavation proceeds without obstacle, timer, or competing pressure. No meaningful escalation occurs; the digging sequence lacks physical difficulty or emotional cost that would force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding letting go—deepens through the layered discoveries (journal, map, letter) that reweight the snow globe's significance. The final choice to leave the globe demonstrates agency with clear cost. Limited deduction for relatively low external pressure; the conflict remains primarily internal/philosophical without urgent physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.3)
    The dominant stake—freeing the ghost—is signaled early, and pressure escalates through the storm's timing constraint. However, the conflict lacks meaningful resistance or complication; Elara succeeds on her first attempt without setback, and the "between lightning and thunder" deadline creates urgency without forcing difficult trade-offs or visible cost beyond her continued solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake (seeking joy beneath anguish) is signaled early and the elevator's ascent provides natural escalation. However, no floor presents genuine obstacles or forces trade-offs—each yields its clue without resistance. The riddle on floor five and the key on floor eight arrive too conveniently.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—is signaled early but escalation remains conceptual rather than visceral. The gondola's stranding creates initial pressure that dissipates when Elara leaps without consequence, and the magical restoration removes the established physical jeopardy without extracting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing infinity within finite bounds—maintains consistency but lacks escalating pressure beyond the building's background threat. The discovery sequence (coin→book→safe→puzzle) provides forward movement but each stage arrives without meaningful resistance or cost. The final completion occurs without visible struggle; "hours passed, or perhaps minutes" deflates temporal urgency rather than heightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from intellectual curiosity to discovery of the hidden chamber, with the glowing board creating a clear tightening moment that narrows Elara's path. The protagonist's agency drives each step—translating, following, discovering—though opposition remains minimal (only the puzzle's difficulty). The cost of isolation and Thorne's loss provides emotional weight but lacks immediate dramatic pressure in the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—finding tools to repair prophecies and time—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers the pattern pointing to the hidden door. The hall of mirrors provides meaningful deepening as she confronts multiple versions of herself, forcing recognition of interconnectedness. However, external pressure remains minimal (no antagonist or time constraint), and the cost of her transformation could be more concretely dramatized rather than philosophically stated.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are clear (restore the nebula) but escalation is minimal—the team encounters no significant obstacles between deciding to act and succeeding. The bell restoration proceeds smoothly through each character's convenient specialty. No reversal or tightening narrows options; success feels guaranteed.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (preventing doomsday) is clear, and pressure builds through the lighthouse's physical responses and Elara's faltering confidence. The story achieves one meaningful deepening when doubt creeps in and she must recommit. However, the resolution arrives too easily - the puppet "slowly, miraculously" mends without sufficient struggle or visible trade-off beyond the initial blood offering.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal duty to immediate life-threat when the traveler appears, forcing action under time pressure ("The mechanical birds would find them soon"). The nut's discovery pays off through map creation that enables rescue. However, the mechanical birds' threat could be more viscerally demonstrated rather than stated, and the curse's weakening feels slightly unearned given the single action taken.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elena's need to transform her isolating grief—is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation. The insight arrives without sufficient resistance or complication; she simply watches foam and achieves clarity. While the cost of her brother's death is established, no new pressure tests her commitment to change during the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=4.1)
    The dominant stake—finding "where stories begin"—remains abstract throughout. No meaningful escalation occurs; Elara's ascent meets no real opposition beyond navigating fragmented shelves. The vial retrieval lacks tension as her "quantifying absence" method succeeds without complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on transforming stored remorse, with escalation through increasingly intense memories culminating in Elara confronting her own "unspoken dreams." The cost appears ("tears," "her own sorrow") but remains somewhat general rather than specific - we don't see what particular memory or capability she loses.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=3.8)
    The central conflict—fragmented community needs reunification—never faces genuine opposition or complication. Elara sings, the clock responds, people gather and harmonize without resistance. No meaningful escalation occurs; the resolution arrives through convenient magical causality rather than earned pressure that forces trade-offs or reveals cost.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    Stakes remain largely internal and abstract—"resurrect dreams," "confront entanglements"—without concrete opposition or cost. The mirror modification carries stated risk ("could unravel her mind") but no dramatized struggle or price. Under the accumulative lens, density increases but without forcing a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (finding forgotten combinations) is signaled early and tightens through the gravity inversion sequence. Agency drives the resolution through Elara's choice to enter during the specific hour and align the manuscript. However, the acquisition of the seed lacks immediate opposition or trade-off - the cost is declared ("responsibility") rather than dramatized through sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—creating music in silence—is established early but never faces genuine opposition or complication. Elara's work proceeds without setback, the sculpture transforms without resistance, and the porcelain insulator helps rather than challenges, resulting in no meaningful escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—proving silence can bridge rather than barrier—is signaled early and maintains focus. The chess pieces moving "as if guided by an unseen hand" represents the story's tightening moment, but this external intervention undermines earned escalation. The knight's sacrifice provides symbolic cost, yet lacks the visceral price that would elevate the conflict beyond intellectual exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding grandmother's silence) is signaled early but never genuinely threatened—the diary opens too easily through mystical hand-waving rather than earned struggle. No meaningful tightening occurs; Elara's "method" succeeds without adaptation or trade-off, and the resolution arrives without forcing her to choose between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake of finding "something beyond the tangible" is signaled but never faces concrete pressure. No meaningful tightening occurs—Elara simply tends the plant, dreams, and receives wisdom without opposition or trade-off. The transformation happens to her rather than through her agency, with no foreclosed options or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake (finding resilience source) is clear but escalation is minimal - the arrow simply leads Elara to the grove without meaningful obstacles or reversals. The gravity inversion creates atmosphere but doesn't complicate her progress. No visible price is paid; she achieves her goal without trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding the disaster to prevent future ones—is signaled early but faces no meaningful tightening or opposition. Elara's investigation proceeds without obstacles, reversals, or competing pressures that would force trade-offs. The discovered truth about wind patterns doesn't alter her tactics or require sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.6)
    The story lacks meaningful escalation—Elara faces no opposition or complication between deciding to act and succeeding. The "oscillating between repose and urgency" is told but not dramatized through rising pressure. No cost materializes; she simply performs her task and wins.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are signaled early (retrieve the flute to understand past failure), and pressure mildly escalates through the canyon journey to the moment of playing the flute. However, the resolution lacks visible cost—Elara achieves her goal of weaving between worlds without sacrifice or trade-off, and "ready to face whatever came next" substitutes abstract readiness for concrete consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake of understanding empathy escalates when the fragment's energy threatens to overwhelm Elias, forcing him to "ground himself" against the flood of others' emotions. The cost appears in his physical struggle, though the resolution toward "equipped to navigate turbulence" lacks the sharp price a higher score demands.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from routine delivery to personal transformation as the pendant's vibrations intensify with distance and emotional state, culminating in Elara's realization of being chosen. The cost—leaving the familiar world of memory for the uncertain fade—is present but could be sharper; we need more visceral sense of what she's sacrificing.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—faces one meaningful deepening when the prism reveals not just data but human grief. The pressure builds through textural accumulation rather than reversals, appropriate for the lens. However, the resolution feels slightly too neat; more resistance or ambiguity would strengthen the earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake of "carrying a message across impossible distance" never faces concrete opposition or tightening pressure. The journey through strange phenomena (backward streams, mid-air flowers) provides texture but doesn't escalate conflict or narrow options. The final choice to step onto the bridge lacks earned tension since no alternative path was dramatized or foreclosed with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal forge work to planetary salvation, with the "awakening" trade creating tension. However, the mine descent summarizes danger ("walls crumbling") without dramatizing specific obstacles or near-failures that would heighten pressure through concrete choice points.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake (discovering a withheld truth) remains abstract throughout, never facing concrete tests or forcing trade-offs. No meaningful escalation occurs - Elara moves through revelations passively, accepting each new reality without resistance or tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from routine maintenance to mysterious threat through the lamp failure and cryptic messages. The pressure coheres around "protecting the light," though the actual threat remains too abstract—we never learn what specifically endangers the lighthouse or why Elias alone can protect it.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.9)
    Initial tension emerges when the beam escapes control, but escalation plateaus quickly as the Herald understands and accepts their role without meaningful resistance. The gateway opening lacks concrete opposition - the fog "resists" but yields to determination alone. Cost remains abstract ("work far from over") rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why people magnetize stories—gets explored through Kael's encounter with the widow. Pressure accumulates as her grief surfaces ("My husband died a year ago"), but escalation remains conversational without forcing trade-offs. The resolution offers philosophical comfort without requiring either character to sacrifice or choose between competing goods, limiting the felt cost needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes center on discovering "what trees witness" with escalation through the sextant's progressive healing and dream coalescence. The transformation from broken to whole provides visible change, but protagonist agency remains observational rather than decisional at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate through the accumulation of song fragments, each discovery deepening Elara's connection to her lost community. The tension builds adequately as she struggles to recall the final thread, though the resolution lacks a sharp trade-off or foreclosed option that would push into higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's search for meaning through paradox—develops through accumulative discoveries but lacks genuine pressure or cost. No meaningful obstacles challenge her progress; each revelation arrives without resistance. The final transformation occurs without visible trade-off or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake—finding sacred in ordinary through guerrilla gardening—is signaled early and deepens through the discovered plaque that validates her method. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres through pattern building, though the tightening remains gentle without forcing hard trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.9)
    Central stake of preserving meaning against oblivion is clear from opening and deepens when Elara discovers the slides are "keys to something greater." The slide transformation creates genuine escalation with visible change (figure now holds lantern). However, the conflict lacks concrete opposition or cost—the transformation happens without struggle or sacrifice, and no clear price is paid for the new understanding beyond accepting responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (exposing betrayal/maintaining truce) is signaled early and tested through confrontation. Lila's verbal maneuvering shows agency, and tension builds adequately. However, escalation lacks meaningful tightening - the thieves simply back down without forcing a trade-off, and no visible price is paid for maintaining the fragile peace.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes center on Elara understanding her luminous nature and potential guardianship role. The ring's taste signals create micro-escalation (danger/opportunity), but the central conflict resolves through explanation rather than earned pressure—Elara faces no meaningful opposition or cost before accepting her role.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (creative liberation vs. safety) is clear but escalation relies on a discovered painting rather than protagonist-driven pressure. The internal conflict between fear and calling lacks a meaningful tightening moment—discovery happens to her rather than through her agency. Cost exists (years of suppression) but isn't actively contested in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (finding lost conversations to restore the oasis) is clear early. Escalation occurs through discovery → revelation of betrayal → choice to act despite cost. The tightening when Elara's leaves wilt from the dishonesty creates genuine pressure, though the resolution's immediate physical payoff undermines some earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Elara encounters no opposition, makes no difficult choices, and pays no price. The "symphony of truth" moment is purely descriptive without stakes. The story lacks even one tightening turn or deepening that would narrow options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake (preserving the farm from chaos) is signaled early and faces one meaningful test when fears materialize. However, the miniaturization process lacks concrete opposition—fears "resist" but we don't see how this resistance manifests or what tactics Elara must adapt.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—unlocking the mailbox's secret—escalates through revelation (Mrs. Ellis's backstory) and discovery (hidden key), but Clara faces no meaningful opposition or cost.

Agency exists in Clara's decision to listen and read aloud, but without visible price or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating buried knowledge—remains static throughout without meaningful tightening or complication. The dance sequence represents the story's single escalation point, but it resolves too smoothly without resistance or cost. No opposing force challenges Elara's progress; the laboratory simply yields to her movements without extracting a price.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=4.7)
    The dominant stake (recovering lost memories) is signaled early but never faces concrete opposition or cost—Eli simply performs his ritual and succeeds.

The resolution arrives through unexplained mystical mechanics rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—preventing prophecy-induced chaos—never faces concrete testing or complication. Elara encounters "resistance" described as thrashing words, but this manifests only as internal sensation without external cost or tactical adjustment. The resolution arrives through sheer will ("final surge") rather than earned escalation, and no meaningful options are foreclosed or prices paid.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes escalate from mysterious encounter to revelation about the seal as "key to the language of the past," forcing Clara to reconsider her isolation. The pressure accumulates through Elias's teaching about "borrowing sugar" as pathway to connection. Yet the conflict lacks visceral resistance - Clara's journey from suspicion to acceptance feels too smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to responsibility as Elara discovers she's the memories' "unwilling archivist." The transformation sequence provides deepening through emotional accumulation. However, the conflict lacks genuine resistance—Elara's skepticism dissolves too easily, and no real price is extracted for her acceptance of this role.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (forgive or remain bitter) escalates through Elara's hesitation and the thorn's dual power - "not just physical; it was emotional." The cost is visible in released pain, though the conflict lacks external pressure or complication beyond internal resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract—understanding "why some people echo" never faces concrete opposition or cost. The single tightening occurs when Elara must look into the pool, but this choice lacks trade-offs; she gains knowledge without sacrificing anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the snow globe's story—develops through accumulating dream visions that progressively reveal the family's tragedy. The escalation from child's laughter to mother's tears to final revelation follows the textural lens appropriately. However, Elara encounters no resistance or complication; the visions arrive without struggle, and she faces no difficult choices about whether to continue or what to do with the knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—Elara begins in contemplation and ends in contemplation with only abstract "crystallization" of thoughts between. The dominant stake (understanding hidden patterns) never faces concrete opposition or test. Her whistle "awakening something within her" promises tension that never materializes into actual pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving life while containing danger—escalates from investigation through discovery to the physical confrontation with the shadow mass, with Elara's chant-scream showing genuine pressure. The cost is visible in the return of dust storms and the shift from comfortable lies to "fragile balance," though the shadow entity's emergence could use more grounded build-up.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes are declared early ("to shape a new dawn") but remain abstract throughout. The voice's ultimatum ("uphold the old order or unfold a new one") presents a binary without concrete tradeoffs—we never see what either choice costs. The climactic portico activation lacks genuine pressure since no opposing force or internal resistance manifests.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elias's quest to preserve lost voices, with escalation through the music box's resistance then autonomous playing. The shattered jar provides concrete cost. However, the conflict lacks sharp edges—the box's initial jamming and sudden cooperation feel somewhat arbitrary rather than earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake (protecting the key) is signaled early but escalation is mechanical - vibration grows louder, figure appears, confrontation occurs. The resolution depends on Elara's sudden realization rather than earned reversal. The figure's retreat after the key glows feels unearned; no prior setup explains why the light would harm it.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake of achieving patience through moon-tracking methodology remains consistent, with one meaningful deepening when Elara realizes the viaduct represents needed connections. Cost appears in her renunciation of urgency, though the escalation relies on internal realization rather than external pressure testing her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering truth while breaking free from control—escalates from investigating deaths to discovering systemic corruption to implicating her mentor. The journal discovery meaningfully tightens options by forcing Elara to confront her mentor's involvement. However, the escalation feels somewhat mechanical, and the final confrontation with evidence lacks immediate dramatic pressure or visible opponent resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to act on Thomas's innocence claim—is signaled early but never faces concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—creating the yearning algorithm—progresses through weeks of work to breakthrough, but lacks meaningful tightening or reversal. The bell's manifestation arrives without cost or trade-off; Lira simply succeeds through persistence. The world's response suggests larger implications but doesn't force Lira to choose or sacrifice anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract—finding truth about a decades-old disappearance—without immediate pressure on Elara beyond curiosity. The system lockout creates momentary obstacle but she bypasses it easily; no meaningful tightening occurs and the discovery of coordinates doesn't force a costly choice or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—bridging fractured souls through empathy—is signaled early and maintains focus. Each mirror revelation deepens understanding, though these accumulate without true resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest to understand endings—is signaled early but lacks escalating pressure. The man's question about "the sound of it coming" provides the story's only meaningful tightening, forcing Elara to articulate her understanding. However, there's no real cost or trade-off; she achieves her insight without sacrificing anything tangible, and the resolution feels too easy for the weight of the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the nature of connection—develops through accumulation of insights rather than escalating pressure. While the meditation deepens from personal loss to universal understanding, there's no competing force or tightening constraint that would force harder choices or reveal cost.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving wisdom before the prophet arrives) is signaled early and maintains coherent pressure through the consecration ritual. The tightening occurs when "the very fabric of time paused to witness her act," showing escalation. However, the prophet's arrival lacks dramatic tension - there's no meaningful resistance or complication, reducing the sense of earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs under the accumulative lens. Elara arranges photographs without encountering resistance or having to trade anything off. The dominant stake of "collective healing" faces no test or complication that would create pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—decoding the pattern to restore language—is clear, but escalation remains minimal. The crystal responds variably to Elias's humming, creating minor tension, but no significant reversal or tightening occurs until the final revelation. The cost (crystal's depletion) arrives suddenly without building pressure; we don't see Elias making increasingly difficult choices as the energy drains.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (capturing the sound of growing older) intensifies through accumulation as fog lifts and sculptures gain meaning, culminating in the pond scene where Elias achieves his goal but pays the price of recognizing wasted years. The escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake of "harnessing the ephemeral" is signaled early and deepens through Elara's shift from repair to reimagination. However, escalation remains internal without clear opposition or rising cost—the spinning clock hand presents a puzzle rather than active pressure, and no meaningful option is foreclosed until the abstract resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—achieving reconciliation before death—is clear but faces minimal resistance. The estrangement provides tension but no active opposition or complication challenges Elara's intervention. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure builds modestly through time running out and emotional weight, but lacks a meaningful tightening that would force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes are signaled early (finding where shadows go at noon) but never truly tested—Elara succeeds without facing genuine opposition or paying a price. The "sealed awakening" threat remains abstract, never manifesting as concrete pressure on her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to confronting guilt about her friend's "substitute body," with the fountain woman's demand creating a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or tightening. The polishing process proceeds smoothly to success without reversals or cost. Missing escalation: no force tests her vow or makes her choose between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.1)
    The dominant stake of protected vulnerability faces one meaningful test when Kai arrives knowing her confession, forcing Elara to choose between isolation and guided sharing. The notebook exchange deepens options but lacks sufficient pressure to fully transform the refuge-to-beginning shift.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal artistic struggle to responsibility for preserving forgotten stories, with each ghostly encounter adding weight. The shell fragment's transformation to glowing key marks meaningful deepening, though the resolution lacks a moment of genuine risk or trade-off before Elara's acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are clearly established—restore practices to heal village—but escalation is minimal. The songs simply arrive when Elara hums at the right moment without meaningful resistance or complication; success feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs—the ritual proceeds smoothly from arrangement to sealing without complication or resistance.

Stakes remain abstract (translating heartbeats into maps) without concrete testing or cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=3.8)
    No meaningful escalation occurs - Elias works, makes a breakthrough, and succeeds without rising pressure or narrowing options. The "wounded season" provides backdrop but doesn't tighten stakes or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether to continue bearing others' burdens or examine her own—is clear and tightens when the figure offers choice. However, the escalation relies heavily on philosophical dialogue rather than dramatized pressure. The cost of her calcified soul is stated but not sufficiently felt through concrete consequence or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—harvesting lessons from loss through creation—intensifies as the carving progresses from blank wood to completed lion. The escalation works through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. The cost is legible in accepting the "here and gone" nature of grief while creating something permanent.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake - negotiating with one's ghost/eroded ambitions - maintains coherence throughout. Pressure accumulates through fragment collection and the wheel's revelations, culminating in the reframing at closure. However, the escalation lacks a decisive middle tightening; the voice's message provides resolution without sufficient complication.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - finding hope in ruins - is signaled early and deepens as Eli discovers the terminal's latent potential. The escalation from passive observation to active manipulation ("opened vents...propped up mirrors...rigged old speakers") shows agency. However, the lack of meaningful opposition or complications prevents higher scoring; his experiments succeed too easily.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake of reconciling duty versus dreams escalates from passive remembering to active completion of the clock, with the whispered "bear" forcing stance crystallization. The pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. Cost becomes visible in the "hours passed" of labor, though the resolution feels slightly too harmonious—"finding a way to carry it with her" softens what could be sharper trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.9)
    Stakes remain abstract - understanding "the architecture of lies" never translates to concrete risk or trade-off.

No meaningful tightening occurs - she begins seeking truth and ends having found it without sacrificing anything tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—"preserving ancient methods" never faces concrete opposition or risk. The knot-decoding proceeds without obstacles, time pressure, or meaningful deepening beyond "each knot represented a step, a method, a story." No option is foreclosed, no price extracted.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from observation to participation as the traveler moves from witnessing to reading the obituary aloud, culminating in receiving the thread. The woman's emotional release provides visible cost. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment that would elevate to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake of reawakening beauty is clear, but escalation is minimal - Kael moves from research to discovery to assembly without meaningful tightening of options. The machine's cryptic message about understanding cost doesn't force a genuine trade-off. The visions of a reborn world arrive without Kael paying a price or making a sacrifice that would demonstrate agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—proving transformation is possible despite inherited shame—remains consistent, with the grafting attempt providing one meaningful deepening as Elara shifts from fighting fires to creating life.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to city-wide restoration as each breadcrumb deepens Elara's connection to the box ("sync with her heartbeat"). The dominant stake—liberating trapped memories—builds through accumulating clues, though the middle lacks genuine obstacles or reversals. The final cost is visible (personal memories released trigger citywide transformation) but arrives without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.2)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without fire—faces no genuine opposition or escalating pressure. Elara's "sonar pinging" intensifies the gear's glow, but there's no cost, reversal, or narrowing of options. The story declares "weight of her purpose" without dramatizing what makes this difficult or what she risks losing.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.6)
    The central tension—how to capture loss in finite marble—develops through accumulative pressure rather than causal escalation. The resolution emerges from pattern recognition (ribbon resembling butterfly flight) leading to conceptual shift, appropriate for the textural lens but lacking a moment where options genuinely narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes center on restoring balance—first mechanical, then communal—but escalation occurs through summary ("As days turned into weeks") rather than dramatized pressure. The story tells us about transformation without showing the friction of actual encounters, missing the accumulative density this textural approach requires.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.8)
    Minimal escalation occurs - Elias discovers case, examines tapestry, decodes pattern, finds meaning. No meaningful tightening or deepening challenges his process. The chess clock "runs down" but creates no time pressure. The dominant stake (understanding hidden stories) faces no opposition or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.6)
    Stakes remain conceptual - "stagnant creativity" and "forgotten dreams" - without concrete manifestation in scene. The conflict resolves through the magical act of writing rather than through pressure that forces difficult choice or genuine trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—resurrecting lost stories—intensifies when the pirate broadcast offers a concrete path forward, forcing Clara to choose between her methodical copying and this mysterious opportunity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—honoring the dead through ritual completion—is signaled early and maintains coherence. Escalation occurs through accumulative pressure as Elara moves from observation to action, with the chair's slowing creating temporal urgency. The cost manifests in accepting impermanence, though the conflict lacks a decisive tightening moment that would foreclose options or force trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.0)
    The dominant stake (preserve past vs. embrace future) is signaled early but never faces genuine pressure beyond philosophical debate. The collapse provides external urgency but doesn't force Kael to sacrifice anything meaningful. His decision to leave the sewer costs him nothing we can see, and the "competing narratives" remain abstract rather than forcing concrete trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.2)
    Stakes center on preserving vanishing arts but never face concrete opposition—the "encroaching noise of indifference" remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal doubt to community transformation, with the pruning action forcing trade-offs between fear and growth. However, the magical fruit's instant wisdom-granting undercuts earned struggle - the transformation arrives too easily without sufficient resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake - uncovering the truth about the blackout - is signaled early but lacks escalating pressure. Elara faces no meaningful opposition or trade-offs; she simply follows clues in sequence. The discovery of the drones' sacrifice attempts to raise stakes retroactively but doesn't create on-page tension or force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=3.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding why houses feel alive—never faces concrete pressure or opposition, remaining a philosophical question without urgency or cost. No meaningful escalation occurs; Elias collects objects, arranges them, speaks to them, and experiences a vague "shift" without any narrowing of options or forced trade-offs. The resolution arrives through convenient enlightenment rather than earned struggle, with no visible price for his newfound understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—saving the village—escalates through Liora's intervention creating doubt in Elara's certainty. The structural weakness of the ampoule provides concrete pressure. Yet the resolution occurs off-page through summary, diluting the cost that should charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.9)
    Escalation occurs through the dice loss forcing acceptance, with agency shown in Elara's choice to continue rather than retrieve. The cost is legible when she accepts the loss and reframes her quest, though the pressure could intensify more sharply—the staircase's tests feel more philosophical than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness through recovering lost language—emerges clearly and deepens as Elara shifts from personal to communal purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    Clear escalation as Elias progresses from examination to dismantling to activation, with the island's resistance providing counter-pressure. The stake (transcending fate) remains consistent. However, the resolution lacks a concrete price - we see success but not what Elias sacrifices or loses in achieving it.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.1)
    Pressure accumulates through the advisor's challenges and Clara's navigation of the funhouse's psychological obstacles. The dominant stake (confronting the fear of being forgotten) crystallizes when she "unbosomed her deepest terror." However, the resolution arrives through realization rather than dramatized struggle—fear simply "trembled" and dissolved once understood.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=4.9)
    The dominant stake - resolving dissonance through music - progresses from sensing restlessness to playing notes to achieving harmony, but lacks genuine opposition or cost. The escalation is smooth rather than pressured; no meaningful obstacles test Leeward's ability or force difficult choices.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (city's survival) is signaled early through "sunwashed dread" and shell cracks. Escalation occurs through the tunnel descent and revelation sequence, with pressure tightening as Elara learns the true danger.

The final cost (bearing responsibility for an entire city) is conceptually heavy but lacks immediate dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering truth versus preserving noble lies—is established early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through spatial deepening (surface to basement) and conceptual shifts (opposition to understanding), though physical obstacles lack genuine threat. The riddle and hidden key provide mild complication without significant cost or risk to Elara's goal.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—whether forgotten dreams can be resurrected—intensifies through physical discovery (journal), deliberate action (repairs with note), and mystical revelation (glowing mosaic). Elias's agency drives each escalation, from choosing to wade deeper to sealing his note in stone. The cost appears in his raw hands and soaked clothes, though the emotional stakes could tighten more sharply between discovery and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely intellectual—uncovering truth—without escalating pressure or meaningful obstacles. The blackout creates initial tension but doesn't tighten choices; Elara proceeds methodically without forced trade-offs or visible cost until the gentle resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.2)
    Internal conflict escalates from hollow craft to Lira's intervention to basilica revelation, with the unfolding crane as decisive action carrying emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the story establishes Zara's stake (finding meaning after trauma), there's no meaningful escalation or tightening—she studies crystals, has an insight, and feels purposeful without facing opposition or making a choice that forecloses options. The perturbation theory concept remains abstract rather than generating concrete pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.4)
    Stakes remain abstract throughout—"decoding the frequency of belonging" never translates to concrete pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.6)
    Internal conflict escalates from unease to crushing guilt as Elias moves through the driftwood pieces, with the watch hand serving as tangible pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.6)

The resolution arrives through philosophical persuasion rather than pressure that narrows options or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.2)
    The dominant stake (finding purpose after failure) is signaled early but never faces concrete pressure or test. No meaningful escalation occurs—Mara simply paddles out and feels better. The "backlash of regrets" remains static weight rather than active opposition that forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.1)
    The dominant stake—finding empathy or purpose after memory loss—remains abstract throughout. The baseball dropping creates a minor turn but no real escalation of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reforging a severed bond—is clear from the opening, and there's escalation as Elara moves from receiving the fortune to conjuring to accepting transformation.

The "reluctant metamorphosis" is told rather than dramatized through resistance, and no meaningful option is foreclosed until the abstract final acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—reconciling missed moments—intensifies through the saucer's glowing revelation and Elara's confrontation with specific losses. The unfastening of the cloak marks a meaningful deepening that forecloses her previous path.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.5)
    Stakes center on humanity's survival through dimension-opening, with Elara's shadow work providing internal pressure. The gravitational shifts create modest escalation, but the resolution through stitching air lacks concrete opposition or meaningful trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    The story's central tension—following the mysterious hush versus climbing the volcano—creates meaningful pressure that builds through accumulation.

However, escalation relies heavily on atmospheric intensification rather than concrete stakes, and the resolution comes through mystical revelation rather than earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are signaled (sparking revolution) but the confrontation with Thorne deflates too quickly - his hesitation and silence feel unearned given his established loyalty. The dominant stake lacks genuine opposition; Thorne's resistance evaporates without meaningful cost or struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding sacred patterns—escalates through the rock sequence building to the star dust scattering, with meaningful deepening when "The aurora surged" and eels leap in harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—confronting censored truths—escalates from receiving the envelope through opening it to writing uncensored.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes center on "forging beauty from anarchy" but remain largely philosophical rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.1)
    The monsoon deadline creates urgency but remains distant threat rather than immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on Elias's need to process unspoken regret, with escalation through compass settling, pattern deciphering, and letter discovery.

    Under the accumulative lens, escalation is achieved through the increasing density and emotional weight of the summarized silences, each story deepening the stakes of the map-making.

The price of their obsession is felt in the palpable, living silence that wraps around them.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under the Accumulative lens, escalation is a decisive cadence shift and density increase triggered by Unit-7's agential choice to play the violin.

    Stakes are clearly signaled (restore dreams) and escalate through Elara's discoveries, tightening her options to the ritual. The cost is legible in the "weight of centuries pressing upon her." A minor deduction as the final escalation via the ritual feels somewhat declarative rather than deeply earned through prior tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the causal lens: finding the specs leads to decoding dreams, which leads to a plan.

The cost is felt in his decision to forego his monthly molt, a visible price that charges the final image. Agency is clear, driven by protagonist choice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's agency under the accumulative lens—her decision to follow the compasses deepens the emotional and spatial pressure. The cost is legible in the trembling hands and reconfiguration of her purpose, though the film's mechanics slightly ease the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are clearly signaled and escalate coherently under the causal lens via the approaching monsoon. A single, meaningful tightening occurs at the creature's challenge. The cost of potential forgetting is legible, though the confrontation's escalation feels slightly abbreviated, lacking a deeper, multi-beat pressure exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: Elias's decision to study the objects and then follow the compass's direction constitutes a meaningful tightening. The cost is legible in the physical difficulty of the path and the emotional weight of the letters. The dominant stake (resolving regret) is signaled early and paid off with a visible forfeiture (the letters dissolving).

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure accrues through pattern density and a cadence shift as the dust “responds,” culminating in coalescence. Dominant stake is internal (meaning/purpose), and escalation is credible under the accumulative lens. However, options never truly narrow nor is a tangible price extracted; conflict remains gentle and unopposed. The ending feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (uncover truth/find apprentice) is signaled and advances through discovery. Escalation occurs, but opposition is largely off‑stage, so tension lacks an acute test or on‑page price. The final turn reweights options but doesn’t force a concrete trade‑off. Agency is present, yet the beat never bites down on cost.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are singular (bridge before/after) and escalation tracks through discovery and collaborative amplification. Pressure is gentle; coincidence doesn’t resolve, but cost is more conceptual than priced on the page. The night’s work offers a credible tightening, and the final strike is protagonist-driven. Absent is a clear foreclosed option beyond the implied relinquishment of recreating sound as sound.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible early (restore the lens, let the city be heard), and there’s a single tightening as the missing fragments are discovered and assembled. Still, obstacles are summarized rather than confronted, and there’s no visible price beyond effort; no credible loss or trade-off forces adaptation. The resolution depends mainly on persistence, not on a pressured choice with cost. Tension stays steady rather than escalating sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (unity under sanctions) is clear; pressure tightens when anonymity breaks and Mara chooses to declare and convene. The visible cost—relinquishing secrecy under sanction risk—lands. The conflict remains low-temperature, with little direct opposition on the page, but the internal/external weave is credible. One meaningful tightening rather than robust reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure deepens once via discovery and culminates in the emblematic act of emplacement, but the path faces little friction or trade‑off. The dominant stake (unused love) is tested through memory and ritual more than contested. The escalation reads as density/pattern intensification appropriate to the lens, though the felt price remains soft. Agency is present yet never costly beyond admission of past failure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering time/memory) is clear; escalation arrives through intensifying environment and the fragment’s rising heat. The decisive tightening is placing the fragment, but the path faces little resistance, and the price (losing the fragment, sensory overwhelm) is modest. Pressure coheres under the chosen lens yet lacks a sharp trade‑off. Resolution is earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via two pressures: approaching men and the imminent wall collapse. The meaningful tightening occurs at the descent/ascent window when the wall groans and pursuers close in, narrowing options. On‑page price is mainly risk and encumbrance rather than a concrete loss, keeping the upper band in check. Agency drives the result.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates once: the move from sensing absences to committing one to the forge. The cost is emotional and legible; however, obstacles are minimal and pressure could tighten further with a sharper trade‑off or risk. Still, the cadence shift at the forge is decisive and earned under the accumulative lens. Resolution arises from her agency and acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are emotionally framed but soft; the trap decodes quickly and becomes an invitation rather than a test. The key tightening is the reinterpretation of the bouquet, which opens the panel and shifts options. Little is visibly lost or risked for the gain, so pressure plateaus after the reveal. The ending’s consequence is anticipated rather than paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes center on whether she truly lets go of control and vulnerability; the pressure coheres as she moves from preparation to renunciation. The decisive tightening is the choice to enshrine the grandmother’s bookmark, foreclosing its prior use and symbolically risking legacy. Internal and external (ice thaw) threads interweave without forced drama. Escalation is modest but real, appropriate to the quiet mode.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (self‑reclamation) is signaled early and tightened via the discovery of betrayal and the key/door progression. Escalation is coherent under a causal lens, but antagonistic pressure is largely offstage and resistance low—decoding and access come with limited friction. The final turn is protagonist‑driven and changes options, yet the felt price is modest. A single complicating setback would have sharpened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clear—capture darkness by mapping it—and pressure coheres via the dwindling star and the deepening hush. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial, with a meaningful tightening when the oracle reaches the personal story and the last star flickers out. The price remains mostly implied (self‑erasure into the work, solitude). A sharper on‑page trade‑off would raise intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—understanding the origin of thought—is signaled early and tightened as the music induces looped timelines toward a climax. The decisive deepening occurs when the melody peaks and the realization reconfigures identity. Still, the price paid remains mostly conceptual, and concrete foreclosed options are only lightly implied. Tension is steady and coherent but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are focused (repair trust), and pressure coheres: reflection → decision to draw → offering → response. The tightening comes from risking a vulnerable gesture instead of guarded conversation. Resolution is earned but arrives smoothly, with little friction or pushback, limiting the sense of price paid. The conflict’s internal/external weave is effective for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (self-proof versus acceptance) is clear, and pressure deepens via sustained ritual rather than reversals. The meaningful tightening is the daily placement culminating in the final marble and reframed purpose. Costs are mostly conceptual/emotional, not dramatized as lost options, keeping the heat modest. Tension remains coherent but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates via her first lever pull causing systemic failure. The reversal is earned by a second, precise adjustment that tests her commitment. The price is felt in the station’s near‑collapse, though little persists as concrete loss, keeping the tension from peaking higher. Agency drives every major turn.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—breaking the silence by decoding the ghost’s work—is clear and escalates through a decisive intensification when Clara hums and the setting responds. Under the accumulative lens, the density rise functions as tightening, but options never truly narrow or force a trade-off beyond acceptance. The price paid (losing the program, the ghost’s departure) reads, yet it’s gentle. Still, the cadence shift is earned and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (bear the weight of a swallowed truth) remains clear; escalation arrives via the accidental smudge and the wanderer’s reframing. The choice to embrace imperfection forecloses the path of pristine certainty. The cost is modest but legible at this length (accepting ambiguity and altering the “sacred” image). Pressure grows coherently under the accumulative lens without false complication.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are coherent (truth/closure vs. fear and supernatural threat), with one meaningful tightening as whispers become screams and shadows lunge. The decisive turn—choosing to insert and turn the wheel—resolves the conflict. However, the price paid feels relatively light; danger is felt but not deeply exacting. Tension rises but doesn’t force a hard trade‑off beyond pressing through fear.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: preserving fragile balance versus risking transformation. Pressure escalates coherently (swan awakens → arduous transit → mirror dissolution), and the final stance forecloses an easier, untouched stasis. The conceptual cost lands, though stakes remain partially abstract rather than viscerally embodied. Agency drives the key turns.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is internal—can Elara midwife wonder in Finn at the point of eclipse—and the tightening arrives with the eclipse’s peak and the hand‑link/eyes‑closed act. The price is modest but present (Finn relinquishes dependence on the telescope; Elara reframes her keepsake’s purpose). Escalation remains gentle and singular, consistent with the accumulative lens. No major reversal, but one meaningful deepening lands.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are large (restore dreams) but pressure doesn’t tighten meaningfully; there’s no reversal or complication once the plan is set. The ritual proceeds without resistance, and the “act quickly” clock never bites. Agency is present but untested; the resolution lacks a visible price or trade‑off. Escalation reads as summary of steps rather than mounting conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain largely internal and abstract; tension builds modestly with the midnight hour and the touch of the specs. There’s one meaningful deepening—choosing to go—but no palpable narrowing of options or price paid. The “orchestrate” claim is not pressure‑tested. The result is a soft escalation that relies on declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is clear (stop the possession before completion), and pressure coheres as presence intensifies. Escalation exists via the anchor’s responses and the “race against time,” but the price paid is minimal; no path is meaningfully foreclosed beyond the antagonist dissolving. Agency drives the turn (questions as keys, final declaration), yet threat remains largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes center on completing a transformative act before exhaustion; dawn and fatigue coherently tighten pressure. The meaningful escalation arrives when the writer abandons inscription for activation—whispering into the shell and triggering the harp—culminating in collapse. Prices are felt (spent stamina; relinquished control at the end). The conflict remains primarily internal/artistic, limiting sharpness of reversal but holding tension.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (face the labyrinth of self) is signaled early and escalates through darker variants and the tablet dimming. Pressure increases in texture, but there’s no hard reversal or trade‑off; the path to acceptance is relatively unresisted. Agency is present in choosing paths and pressing on, yet the price paid remains abstract. The resolution feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and well signaled: overcome emotional numbness. Pressure coheres and tightens via the labor of reversing songs and the steady intensification of sensory change; the “tear” is a clear turn with cost. No antagonist needed; the constraint of deafness and self-doubt carries the pressure. A slightly sharper mid-beat test of commitment could lift escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—truth versus safety/solitude—is signaled early, and escalation tracks from sanctuary to guarded facility to masked revelation. The meaningful tightening is the guarded perimeter navigated by patterning the patrols. However, conflict resolves without a tangible loss or reversal, muting consequence. The ending chooses a stance but doesn’t pay a visible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether to confront grief via scent—is signaled early and tightens through the escalating visions toward the decisive uncorking. The price is emotionally legible: risking destabilizing memories he’s avoided. Pressure is primarily internal and accumulative; it could use one sharper external nudge, but the cadence shift suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: how Elias will stance himself toward time/choice. Escalation occurs via density and pattern—shifts reveal map → mirror images → choice to relinquish the rope—consistent with the Accumulative/Textural lens. The cost is felt (foreclosing an old identity/tool), though the pressure remains artfully quiet rather than knife‑edge urgent. The mirror’s options provide a clear tightening before the close.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—can she answer or alter the hush—is established early and escalates through her decision to play and then to speak. The meaningful tightening is the move from testing notes to unbinding a tale, which reweights the space. Still, the opposition is mostly atmospheric; the price of action is subtle, so the pressure never becomes sharply coercive. A touch more friction or consequence would amplify stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—craft joy without attachment—remains coherent, and tension tightens at the petal’s dissolution. Yet opposition is largely internal and gentle, with minimal risk or narrowing of options. The felt price (a controlled ache and acceptance of transience) is present but small. Escalation is more atmospheric than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes center on whether Elara will risk initiating connection; escalation moves from a private read to a mailed overture to an in-person meeting. The pressure rises, but gently; there’s no substantive reversal or narrowing of options beyond choosing to meet. Coincidence (the envelope) complicates without resolving, as allowed, but the cost never sharpens on the page. The reveal warms rather than tests the commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (belonging) is legible from the start, but escalation remains soft and largely summarized. The search broadens rather than tightens pressure, and there’s no beat where a real option is foreclosed with visible cost. Echo’s appearance resolves without a substantive test or reversal. Emotion accumulates, but tension seldom spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure grows (pull intensifies, labyrinth narrows options, dead‑end gate, descent before the window closes). The cost is mostly conceptual/opportunity (cannot remain; power cools), with little resistance or risk beyond time pressure, so escalation feels gentle. Agency drives the turns, not coincidence. A sharper on‑page price or near‑loss would clarify stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure is primarily puzzle‑driven; stakes remain conceptual and the danger manifests via a journal warning rather than on‑page consequence. There is a single deepening turn (the warning) but little narrowing of options or felt cost. Her choice to continue is earnest yet minimally tested. Tension hums but seldom tightens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are legible—connection/visibility through restoration—but pressure remains gentle; opposition is mostly environmental quiet rather than escalating constraint. The deepening (discovering more fragments, colder descent) provides one cadence shift, yet few options are foreclosed on the page. The resolution feels earned but without a tangible price tested under pressure. Tension operates more through reverence than jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—can she relinquish control—tightens through the storm’s intensification and the leaf’s charged handling. The meaningful turn occurs when she presses the leaf to her chest and begins to “reconstruct” by creating space; a path is foreclosed. Cost is emotional and procedural, not external, but it is felt and alters her tactics. Slight softness in external stakes keeps it from higher.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning/role—tightens via discovery and the exchange. Escalation is coherent but gentle; no sharp reversal or visible sacrifice beyond trading the brooch. The old woman’s appearance offers a soft gate rather than a hard pressure test. Resolution is earned but lacks a felt price that would narrow options decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (recovering trust in her gift/identity) is signaled early, and pressure deepens when the cave “chooses” her through the pearl. Escalation is primarily experiential rather than adversarial; agency appears in the touch and acceptance. The price—accepting unpredictability—reads more philosophical than visceral, keeping tension moderate. Effective but low-friction conflict arc.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are focused—will Elara claim the role to summon and compile the lost—and escalate via density: the humming valve, the carved fragment, then the keeper’s appearance. The key tightening is Elara choosing to sound the valve again after the revelation. Costs are understated; there’s little immediate loss beyond stepping into a demanding charge. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens but never fully bites.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes—safety of known routes vs. embracing the unknown—are signaled and tightened by the midnight window and the fortress test. The maze of mirrors deepens pressure by forcing self-confrontation before the final act. The price is mostly internal and implied, losing some tactile bite at the summit. Escalation is steady rather than sharp, but it earns the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    Pressure coheres around whether Elara will submit to the tile’s call and complete the pattern. Escalation is steady (heat, melody, 3D pattern, visions) and culminates in the final transcription. However, stakes remain largely internal and consequences are soft; no option is foreclosed beyond an identity shift. The tightening is meaningful but not costly.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (break monotony at existential risk) tightens coherently: curiosity → experimentation → mutiny → shattering. The escalation is driven by Elyr’s agency using the storm and magnetic fields, and the shatter forecloses “safe retreat.” Costs are sketched (world destabilization, unleashed consequences) and felt, if more conceptually than physically. One concrete loss or damage to Elyr himself would deepen the price.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (keep running via asylum vs. stay and face consequences) is signaled and tightened by the father’s entrance. The mystical activation plus confrontation escalates internal pressure to a clear choice. The on‑page price is soft; consequences are acknowledged but not materially tested in scene. Still, agency drives the resolution rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving time-textures—stays coherent, and escalation arrives through the hum’s intensification and dawn’s approach. Yet the conflict is largely frictionless; no option is foreclosed, and no true trade-off is forced. The lamp’s flicker and the coalesced tone create an engaging peak but without a visible price beyond exertion and ephemerality. The resolution is earned but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming erased histories—tightens meaningfully when the protagonist finds the cataloged crates and chooses to carry Elara’s letter and role forward. Escalation is a deepening rather than a high-risk turn; no antagonist or hard hurdle surfaces. The poison label’s reweighting functions as moral pressure, not danger. The earned renunciation of anonymity-as-drift into guardianship provides a credible, if quiet, price.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (proof vs meaning) is signaled early and tightens as music intensifies and the shell answers. The escalation arrives in a single decisive deepening—the hum syncing with light—reweighting options. The price is intangible but legible: she foregoes a concrete artifact for a lived stance. Stakes could cut sharper if one viable alternative remained live at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (community identity vs privatization) is clear, and pressure coheres toward the festival. Escalation mostly accrues via summary—resistance, Vorin’s opposition, and the rally—without a decisive on‑page test that exacts a price. The tightening beat is the public display becoming a rallying cry. Cost remains largely implied rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—preservation vs. impending alteration—is established early and tightened by the timed message and mission control’s urgency. The meaningful turn is her choice to stay until dawn, fulfilling “Outlast the dawn.” The price is felt but soft; consequence remains largely emotional and procedural rather than materially costly. Tension is steady, if not acute.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (repair and trust) is signaled, but escalation is mostly atmospheric; the ship’s anchor functions as backdrop rather than a ticking clock that alters tactics. The single tightening is the transition from diagnosis to activation, with no visible trade‑off or credible risk. Options never narrow; success feels assured once the method is established. The ending is earned yet low‑tension.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding a river’s beginning—is clear, and pressure builds in a single tightening from observation to discovery. Escalation is gentle: there’s minimal resistance beyond weather and risk, so cost remains low. The falcon’s return catalyzes but does not complicate. Resolution is earned but lacks a turn that forecloses a more palpable alternative.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (revive the town) is steady, and the progression from faint hum to bell toll is a clean deepening under the accumulative lens. Still, opposition is soft; pressure seldom tightens or forces a trade‑off beyond endurance. The “vines retreat” and “cracks mend” signal change but don’t extract a visible price. Quiet conflict works, but escalation feels low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (oxygen/time) is declared but doesn’t escalate on the page; no concrete setbacks test resolve. The unsnarling move is a single, mostly summary solution that unlocks everything. Agency exists but encounters little resistance, so trade‑offs feel minimal. The ending lacks a visible price beyond a reoriented mindset.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (redeem name before the bodies are found) is clear, and pressure coheres through the descent and the father’s journal twist. The meaningful tightening is the revelation that the bodies were offerings and the hush’s cost, which narrows ethical options. However, the ticking clock never bites on-page, and the final choice’s cost is more inferred than felt. One more concrete loss or risk would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (freedom vs. debt) is signaled early; escalation arrives when the bead awakens and the chorus of spirits reframes the debt as collective. The protagonist’s agency crystallizes in choosing to step out, reoriented toward reckoning. The cost is more promised than paid, keeping pressure credible but less visceral. No major reversal, but a meaningful tightening consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared early, but pressure seldom tightens: relics become “inspirations,” not complications. The overlapping paths intensify pattern, yet few options are foreclosed or traded off on the page. The escalation is primarily textural, not conflictual, with limited visible price. The ending resolves without a demanding choice beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (find tomb/restore faith) is signaled early, and escalation arrives when the hollow is found and the slab yields. However, opposition is minimal; no option is truly foreclosed, and the price paid is primarily patience and vulnerability. The tightening is real but gentle, consistent with the accumulative design. A touch more friction or a specific loss would heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (get the letter before it’s mailed) is signaled, yet pressure doesn’t materially tighten—no obstacle, interference, or trade‑off emerges. The time constraint is asserted but not dramatized into a loss or foreclosed option. The “win” arrives on the first try, dulling escalation. Internal stakes echo theme but don’t force a costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—protecting the observatory’s cosmic link—is signaled and tightened by Lira’s arrival and the threat to extinguish the flame. Escalation is mostly informational, with minimal on‑page counterforce; the “night of work” advances knowledge rather than testing resolve under risk. The final turn (path revealed) deepens options but avoids a visible trade‑off or loss. Tension is present but never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: confronting the unsent apology. The meaningful tightening arrives with the sealed letter in her own handwriting, forcing a decision that narrows options. Escalation is largely internal and aesthetic rather than oppositional; there’s little resistance, but the cadence shift at the pedestal credibly raises the cost. Resolution stems from her agency at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are primarily internal (protect the sanctuary’s memory, carry the plea) with a modest external vector (possibility of endangering a hidden reef). Escalation occurs as she pieces the notes into a concrete map and confronts the final plea, but no option is forcefully foreclosed on the page. The anesthetic’s ebb provides a small temporal/physical pressure. The closing decision crystallizes purpose, yet costs are mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is internal (rekindling passion), with escalation via discovery and activation rather than direct opposition. The key tightening is the moment she commits to activate the network and then to paint with light; it reweights options but faces little resistance. Cost registers as vulnerability and relinquishing stagnation, not a hard trade‑off. Pressure stays coherent but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates from craft to enchantment to a choice, but resistance is minimal and outcomes arrive without setback. The dominant stake—awakening the garden/self—is clear and tightens once via the offered exchange. The decision feels consequential but lacks a tangible, painful trade‑off. Tension remains gentle rather than testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (decode/warn, avoid Tax Collectors) is clear; pressure tightens with the shadowed figure and infiltration reveal. Escalation is moderate and largely informational; Elias’s choice to go feels inevitable, with minimal trade-off shown on the page. Stakes trend conceptual rather than visceral; no live loss or foreclosed path beyond implied danger.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear (transform pain); pressure escalates via duration and a single intensification (the shell’s response night). The cost is primarily stamina/time and the near‑sacrifice of the talisman (translucent postcard), not a wrenching trade‑off. Conflict remains internal and steady rather than sharply narrowing options. Resolution is earned by endurance and stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is legible early and guides her choices. Escalation arrives through density: the hum, the Vessel’s activation, and the chime’s shattering, which exacts a price. The pressure is coherent but largely unopposed; no counter‑force beyond overwhelm. Still, one meaningful tightening lands at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (restore Kael’s trust) is clear, and pressure coheres around the promises and approach to the inkwell. Escalation is gentle—little resistance counters her plan, and the symphonic magic resolves swiftly. The turn is real (resolve crystallized → write promises), but the felt price is light. More friction or a trade-off would sharpen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is legible early, yet escalation is gentle and largely internal. The key tightening—realizing “To give is to gain, to break is to mend”—yields a compromise without a hard trade‑off on the page. No reversal or loss tests his commitment; opposition is summarized rather than exerted. Resolution feels earned but low‑cost.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the songs/trusting truth—tightens after the letter and through the methodical mapping. Escalation is measured: density and intention increase, but tangible jeopardy or a foreclosed option is minimal. The choice to send truth‑bearing messages lands but with modest felt price. Tension stays internal and steady rather than ratcheting.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding/closure) is clear and tightens through a single decisive intensification: the terrace’s rearrangement and the buried memory. The cost—letting go of the logbook and accepting an unbridgeable distance—lands on the page. Pressure is primarily internal but coherent under the accumulative lens. A slightly sharper on‑page friction point would have raised escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (belonging vs survival) is signaled early via her search and crystallized by the alarms. Escalation is a clear cadence break that forces a trade‑off; the brief return to dance heightens cost before departure. The price—abandoning the newfound communion—is legible in the last beats. The conflict remains coherent without requiring an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering/understanding the disappearing path) is signaled and pursued; escalation comes via tactic shift to emotion and the fleeting path image. Pressure remains interior and low‑key, with limited felt cost beyond the flicker and acceptance. The tightening is sufficient but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—create a moment of serendipity within a brief window—is legible, but pressure stays gentle. The tightening comes via alignment under the skylight; no option feels foreclosed, and no price is paid on the page. Coincidence complicates pleasantly (crowd motions) rather than tests commitment. Resolution is earned but low‑heat.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are named early (ban/erasure) and escalate coherently with the footsteps and the sentinel’s arrival. The tightening beat—choosing to stand and show the glowing line—narrows options credibly. The price is legible (existential risk persists) even as immediate harm abates. A harder on‑page cost or consequence would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes remain internal: recognize and act “before everything shifts.” The pressure deepens modestly (rings whisper change; the atrium hums), but there’s no on‑page trade‑off or foreclosed option. The decision to share is not tested against a counterforce—only invited by atmosphere. Escalation reads as a gentle cadence shift, not a tightening with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are internal—will he remain defined by guilt or reframe it—and the feather’s visions deepen that pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs as the box “breathes” and reveals borrowed sorrows, reweighting his choice at the end. The cost is felt but muted; there’s little concrete foreclosure beyond a stance shift. Lack of external counterpressure keeps escalation from peaking higher.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internal (can she “solve” hope) with the tide supplying steady pressure; the tightening occurs as water rises, forcing revision and, finally, renunciation of calculation. Costs are present (accepting erasure; abandoning the equation frame) but remain conceptual, not biting. Agency is consistent and the cadence shift is clear. A sharper trade‑off or visible loss would lift the band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres and deepens (echoes grow louder; passage narrows; dead end), but resistance is gentle and solutions arrive without significant friction. The decisive act (pressing the symbol, placing the strip) resolves cleanly with little trade‑off. Stakes are internally meaningful yet feel safe. One clear tightening is present; cost is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear early: persuade mirrors before the bells. Pressure coheres and tightens as the mirrors resist, forcing Elara to increase commitment and pay with her own pulse. The bells function as a live clock; the surrender arrives earned, not coincidental. The visible cost at resolution deepens stakes rather than resetting them.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (end the forever war) is clear and pressure coheres through a prolonged negotiation culminating in her breaking point. The escalation is primarily temporal and emotional rather than tactical, but the zenith timing and her switch from professional to personal speech mark a meaningful tightening. Cost is present, though a foreclosed option or concrete concession would heighten stakes further. The resolution feels earned rather than coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (reviving the birds) is clear and tight; pressure coheres as she hunts for a viable sanctuary. The meaningful tightening is the discovery of damp soil and the commitment to release. Still, external resistance is minimal, and the “risk everything” line doesn’t convert into an on‑page price or foreclosed option. Escalation is steady but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (awaken the city at potential cost) is clear, and the unlocking provides a meaningful turn. Pressure grows through density and focus, but resistance feels low—no setback or trade-off beyond conceptual risk. The emotional price is stated, not fully dramatized under stress. Still, the final release reweights options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—ethical boundary in art—is legible early and deepens through the “reverse” idea. The tightening is internal and credible, but prices (loss of edge, audience expectations, social fallout) aren’t tested or paid on the page. Pressure remains coherent, yet largely unopposed, curbing tension. The final commitment reads earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake: preserving/rekindling a vanishing cadence and memory. Escalation is subtle—the unsettled air, scarcity of monarchs, then the humming and final addition—but there’s limited narrowing of options or visible price. The act feels significant yet doesn’t foreclose a path beyond quiet acceptance. Tension remains atmospheric more than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are singular and legible: awaken and preserve the encoded names. Escalation arrives via sustained effort (hours to days), culminating in the rope’s glow and the emerging melody; pressure coheres under the ritual. The felt price is modest (emotional endurance and prior self-reckoning) with no overt reversal. The tightening is effective but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake is clear (decode to answer the path/walker question), and escalation is a density increase rather than a tightening trade‑off. The storm and the wafer’s intensifying light function as pressure, but they don’t force a costly choice. Resolution arrives via realization, with little legible price or foreclosed option on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain largely abstract: knowledge and covenant, with no opposing force or material risk. The “tightening” is a reveal rather than a reversal; no option is foreclosed on the page. Coincidence (finding the compartment) eases, not pressures, the path. The ending crystallizes intent but without a price that narrows future options in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around persuading Kael; escalation arrives via the embodied memory beat, his recoil, and the final acceptance. The cost is mostly emotional and implicit, with no concrete trade-off or foreclosed path depicted beyond pride. Still, the tightening is clear and agency-driven. No coincidental resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—piercing the boundary to touch the long‑chased dream—is signaled early and escalates as the fog thickens and the repair succeeds. The meaningful tightening is Elara taking the instrument outside to align with a star, converting intention into risk. However, the price for crossing (or almost crossing) remains gentle; the sextant’s fade hints at cost without truly narrowing future options. Tension operates more in cadence than in concrete jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes (mending the vow/self) are declared, but pressure remains gentle and solutions appear with minimal resistance: the key fits, the petals bloom, the compass points. Escalation is more accumulative texture than constriction, with little foreclosing of options or price paid. The shift is earned but low‑tension. No reversal tests her resolve beyond a single “persist” beat.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (decoding the cameo’s meaning) is signaled, but pressure escalates more through ambience than conflict. The bathroom insight is the key tightening, followed by an explanatory encounter that resolves too smoothly. Costs and foreclosed options remain abstract; the protagonist’s agency isn’t tested against resistance. The turn lands intellectually, without a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (find the library before time unravels) is stated early, and escalation exists (maze → traps → temporal garden → guardian). However, pressure rarely tightens with cost; obstacles yield quickly to competence. The renegotiation functions as the main turn, but it resolves smoothly without a trade‑off felt on the page. The world‑scale stakes remain abstract during the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (find the garden/recapture loss) are signaled early and tighten once via the threshold moment prompted by Lyra’s voice. The escalation is largely internal and guided; external pressure is gentle and coincidence‑leaning (the card simply reveals the way). The felt price is modest, keeping tension from peaking higher.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—unlocking meaning—registers, and escalation tracks through the rope’s reconfiguration to the humming and opening. Pressure, however, never bites; no option closes with a felt loss or genuine hazard. As a result, the climax reads assured rather than contested. The tightening exists but with low cost.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (restore harmony) is clear, with one meaningful deepening at the pedestal. Escalation is gentle; the “storm” pressure intensifies atmospherically but produces no hard obstacle or reversal. Agency drives turns (reading cracks, conjuring path, then song), yet the price is light and options rarely foreclosed. The final act resolves decisively without a painful trade.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early and escalates when the partial success introduces a higher price (memory sacrifice). The narrowing from research to sacrifice creates a true trade‑off with visible cost. Agency drives the turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve the problem. Stakes remain coherent and tie internal belief to external action.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure rises when the shadow’s elongation points to a fog wall, yielding visions, but the dominant stake remains abstract and largely unthreatened. There’s a meaningful deepening of knowledge, not a narrowing of options with tangible cost. The escalation is driven by her attention rather than a crucible that forces a trade‑off. Consequences are implied rather than tested.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are coherent (defy hopelessness) with a clear tightening from solitary preparation to communal ignition. Yet resistance is soft; obstacles don’t force trade-offs beyond effort and attention. The major turn is essentially success upon attempt, with little risk of failure dramatized. The visible price remains light, limiting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are internal (method vs. mentor’s critique; understanding time), and escalation is a density increase rather than a tightening with cost. The cicada’s activation deepens pressure, but options do not visibly narrow and no live path is foreclosed on the page. The decision to return to Kael carries promise rather than consequence. As a result, tension remains contemplative more than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are focused: risk a treacherous ascent under a one‑hour inversion to taste a new kind of silence. Escalation is modest but clear—live clock, physical climb, the doll’s slip testing resolve. The ending’s cost is largely internalized; an external trade‑off or loss on the page would sharpen tension. Still, the clock and fragile vines provide credible pressure and a meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (Mira’s need for quiet) is signaled early; escalation occurs as the vial clouds, prompting a course change and a garden pause. Pressure is coherent but low-intensity, with one meaningful tightening; the price is mostly the surrender of agitation. The resolution is earned by Elias’s steady method rather than a contested choice. The lack of a sharper trade-off tempers the score.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    Conflict escalates through deciphering murals, unlocking the archway, and the ascent, but opposition is light and solutions arrive without real friction. The sunrise clock doesn’t materially squeeze choices, and there’s no significant reversal or loss that forecloses options. Agency is consistent, yet the price paid is minimal. The final shift is more interpretive than pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake is signaled early and escalates coherently as the threshold thins and tendrils press. The meaningful tightening is Lira choosing to sacrifice a scar-link to seal the breach, paying a price that alters her state. Agency drives the resolution rather than coincidence. The cost is explicit and charges the aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to executing a reality‑bending machine, but opposition is minimal and success comes without friction or trade‑off. The key tightening is the decision to step through and then engage the machine, yet no choice forecloses a valued path. The “pressure into diamonds” remains literalized more than contested. Ending responsibility implies cost but doesn’t land as price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are signaled (uncover the dynasty’s downfall), but the escalation is largely experiential rather than contested. The revelation is handed to her, minimizing trade‑offs or foreclosed paths on the page. There’s one tightening (music → bridge → journal), but minimal visible price beyond the stated pain of knowledge. Agency doesn’t drive a difficult choice at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—recovering agency in a world of fixed strings—tightens through a clear escalation: gauntlet unsnapped, ink seeping, self seen as puppet, then no-strings figure. Pressure is coherent, but the price paid is largely symbolic, so consequence feels gentler than the rhetoric promises. Agency drives the turn rather than coincidence. A single meaningful deepening lands, appropriate to length.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure is primarily internal and textural: curiosity intensifies to identification (name/unit), then to a decision to write. The meaningful tightening is the reveal of “L. Hayes, 7th Infantry,” shifting from ambience to pursuit. However, opposition and visible price remain low; no option is truly foreclosed beyond a life of non-engagement. The piece still earns a modest deepening consistent with its lens.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (expose truths vs. capture) is clear and tightens when the enforcers arrive, foreclosing easy exit. The reversal is earned by her decision to transmit, sacrificing stealth to achieve the goal. The cost is felt conceptually (increased risk, hunted status), though not physically paid on-page. Tension escalates coherently without gimmicks.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (silence the prophecy) is clear, and pressure heightens as the grotto actively answers the performance. However, resistance is minimal—no tangible counterforce beyond ambient menace—so escalation lacks a moment that truly narrows options or extracts a price. The turn (atrium’s beam toward him) deepens intensity but doesn’t force a trade‑off. Resolution reads earned but easy.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on purpose and guardianship, with escalation via the speck’s activation and the leaves’ whispering. The tightening is mild: options don’t narrow so much as deepen; there’s no forced trade‑off or felt loss. The protagonist’s agency drives beats, but pressure remains largely internal and unopposed. The ending resolves to acceptance without a concrete price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake (control vs. embracing uncertainty) is clear, with one meaningful tightening when he chooses to improvise and descend. However, external pressure is soft—obstacles don’t truly threaten or force trade‑offs beyond the conceptual choice. Coincidence initiates but does not resolve; agency does the work. The cost feels more thematic than tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (redeem the coin/intentions) is clear, and pressure coheres as the coin pulls, the foundry “watches,” and she chooses the furnace. The meaningful tightening is her decision to enter the furnace and face visions; internal and external strands meet there. The cost remains mostly conceptual, so stakes never fully bite, but escalation is orderly and felt. Resolution flows from her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure rises mainly through tonal intensification (harp playing) rather than hard choices; the figure yields quickly, minimizing resistance. The dominant stake is signaled early but never credibly endangered. The one tightening beat is the confession’s embodiment and the release, which narrows options by ending the pursuit. Emotional cost is felt but mild.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around an internal stake (renunciation and reframing), intensifying as she senses a threshold and walks deeper. The strap’s release is a costed choice that forecloses a path. Still, escalation relies more on asserted insight and atmosphere than on hard constraints or competing imperatives. The tightening is real but gentle for the stated ambition.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are clear (reclaiming buried histories), but pressure escalates gently without a decisive narrowing or live risk; obstacles yield immediately (the symbol, the compartment, the hidden door). The single tightening is the discovery of the map, yet no option is foreclosed or traded at a cost until the quiet spend of the fragment’s light. A credible complication testing her commitment would lift tension. As is, conflict remains largely frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: whispers and pulsing cracks escalate to the ghost’s point and the literal reach into the ceiling. Agency drives the turn (he installs the barrel), but the risk and trade-off feel gentle; little is truly foreclosed beyond a diffuse burden lifted. The tightening is single but effective at this length. The resolution is earned, if comfortable.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake is Elara’s pursuit of pattern/eternity; escalation occurs when she leaves safety to test the rupture. Pressure remains gentle—clouds cradle instead of threaten—and consequences feel largely conceptual. There’s one meaningful tightening but little visible price or foreclosed option. Resolution is earned but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (accessing the Hall to prove a theory) is clear and escalates into the storm ritual; the meaningful tightening is the clandestine entry timed to the storm. However, antagonistic pressure is summarized rather than embodied, so risk and cost feel safer than they might. The internal and external strands interweave, but consequence remains mostly emotional. Closure is earned but the on‑page squeeze could sharpen.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates to a focused release at the Covenant, but the path offers little resistance; obstacles are mostly atmospheric. The central tightening—choosing to free rather than repair—lands, though the price feels conceptual more than painful. Tension is consistent but not sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (will she find and face the hinge where logic fails?) tightens at the lagoon with one meaningful deepening: the vision of a gateway and the choice to let the compass go. The cost is clear (losing the grandfather’s compass and relinquishing the demand for explanation), but external pressure remains soft and largely atmospheric. Tension accrues via cadence more than risk, keeping stakes felt but muted. One more concrete constraint or loss would intensify the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (unlocking/understanding the alliance) is legible, with one tightening turn (hidden passage opening). Escalation feels gentle: the storm pauses, obstacles recede, and the chamber yields readily, limiting price and foreclosed options. The final shift is earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure is primarily internal and gentle, with one tightening (choosing to go, then to work through the night). Stakes remain abstract—no meaningful external constraint or trade‑off is forced on the page. The hours spent “reckoning” deepen texture but do not create a decisive reversal. Resolution feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (access the truth) is signaled early; pressure coheres through waiting, ritual action, and the apparition’s test. Escalation is modest and largely situational, with the key tightening when the figure appears and interrogates motive. Elara’s agency resides in persistence and vulnerability rather than a hard trade-off. The price paid (exposure, time, surrendering the diary to scrutiny) reads but doesn’t bite deeply.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake—reimagining a civilization—is declared early, but pressure is minimal and the solution arrives without friction. The single tightening is her rejection of replication, which enables magic rather than costing something on the page. The only visible price is leaving after success, which reads more like vocation ritual than a hard trade‑off. No antagonistic force or resistant resource tests her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—unlocking what the garden “remembers”—is clear, and pressure coheres as the prophecy activates and the symbols confirm it. Escalation is modest; the key tightening is the match between recording and tree markings. Resolution derives from Elara’s agency (choosing to speak), but the price and narrowed options are only lightly felt. No antagonistic counterforce tests her resolve beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is declared (reopen vortex to access “borrowed time”), but pressure scarcely tightens; the arch yields immediately and the realization solves the dilemma. No meaningful trade-off or foreclosed option is dramatized on the page. The choice to step through is brave but untested; costs remain largely conceptual. Tension stays lyrical rather than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on recognizing and crossing a conceptual threshold; escalation is a measured density increase (hum and stillness concentrating to the bell strike). The key choice—pulling the rope again with intent—deepens pressure but doesn’t foreclose a costly path. The final reweighting is earned yet low‑risk, with little loss or trade‑off dramatized. Tension is real but quiet, limiting impact at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes remain internal and modest: meaning and stance toward work. The primary tightening is the constellation revelation and the lantern heating, culminating in her renunciation when it dims. The cost is subtle (surrendering the talisman’s power and choosing ongoing quiet labor), which keeps tension low. The escalation is coherent but not particularly pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain mostly conceptual (“unspoken words”) with few friction points testing resolve; obstacles are discovered rather than contested. The key tightening arrives when ghosts become visible and the ritual is performed, but the price is felt more atmospherically than as a trade‑off. Agency exists yet faces little opposition. The outcome doesn’t demand a difficult sacrifice beyond attention and intention.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are signaled (time destabilizing), and escalation appears with “the day after numbers changed meaning.” However, obstacles are minimal and solutions unresisted; the temporal weaver resolves conflict without a meaningful trade‑off. Pressure tightens once but never truly tests Elara’s limits.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (recovering beauty in the incomplete) is signaled and tightened by the snapped string and the choice to repair. Escalation is modest but present as they cooperatively fix and risk relaunching the kite. The visible price is small—ceding the talisman and the vulnerability of shared work—so intensity stays gentle. Still, the act of tending redefines options and closes the arc credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (legacy/interspecies respect before death) is signaled early, but pressure escalates gently rather than through a narrowing choice. Discovery of hollow pillars deepens stakes yet introduces little resistance or trade‑off. The ending is an earned acceptance rather than a tested decision; visible cost is implied time rather than contested loss. The conflict remains largely internal and serene.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (can she reframe “homecoming” beyond skepticism) is steady, with a single tightening when she confronts the pulsing amber in the chamber. Escalation is more atmospheric than oppositional; the cost is subtle and internal. Her decisive act (placing the amber) resolves the pressure appropriately for the mode but without a sharp trade‑off. Tension functions, if quietly, across beats.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake (restore life to a scarred place) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens; no real reversal or narrowed option tests commitment. The birds’ guidance is a gentle deepening, not an escalation. The ending is earned in tone, yet on‑page cost or a foreclosed path remains minimal. Stakes remain largely conceptual rather than felt under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal—will Elias decode the riddle and what will that mean for his isolation. The phonograph scene offers a single tightening, but opposition is minimal and the solution arrives without a trade‑off beyond a gentle stance shift. Effective for a quiet story, but the pressure never truly pinches. A clearer price for choosing connection (risk, loss, or foreclosed path) would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure remains primarily internal and low‑grade; the dominant stake is clear but escalates gently through repetition rather than a decisive on‑page test. The hum from the compass hints at a turn, yet no option is truly foreclosed beyond a stated acceptance. The dawn cadence shift provides a mild tightening but little visible price. Effective as lyric accumulation, limited as conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (amend the sky) is explicit and the chess match provides a focused crucible. Escalation is limited: the labyrinth and trial are largely summarized, and the game’s turning point arrives without a hard trade-off or narrowing of options beyond the queen sacrifice. Consequences read triumphant rather than costly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant internal stake—unbinding from performed roles—tightens once through the walking ritual that spells charged words. Escalation is felt as a cadence shift rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens. The price is soft (acknowledging her avoidance) and not dramatized as a hard trade‑off. Still, the choice to engage and complete the walk credibly narrows her old path.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (recover language/self/home), and pressure coheres as the stone demands action, the air charges, and the store reconfigures. Escalation is primarily intensification (hidden thunder → roar) rather than narrowing options or a hard trade‑off. The choice to seed via feather texture is the key tightening, but consequences feel largely positive and low‑cost. A single felt loss or foreclosed path would have deepened stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—self‑forgiveness—is signaled early and tightened when the tapestry’s decoding unlocks the labyrinth. The principal deepening is the king/pawn parallel; the on‑page test is the decision to enter and pull the heart thread. Pressure is coherent but gentle; cost is largely internal and not strongly foreclosing an alternative path. One meaningful tightening lands, but escalation stays low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (recasting forgiveness) is signaled early; pressure coherently tightens as the spire “awakens,” shadows manifest, and the cost surfaces. The key turn is her acceptance that forgiveness requires giving up a shard of herself, which narrows options. Escalation is accumulative—density of echoes, light, and figures—not multiple reversals, and it suffices at this length. Slightly soft on an external counterforce, but the internal price lands.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—recover meaning before the relic fails—tightens when the workshop lurches and gears spin wildly. The reversal (system destabilizes, then responds to her assertion) is protagonist‑driven but resolves a bit conveniently. Costs are mostly atmospheric; no concrete loss or foreclosed path beyond surviving the moment. Still, pressure coheres and escalates once in line with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether she will risk revealing her truth through art—is signaled early and tightened by the oasis’s arrival and the act of painting. The meaningful turn is her explicit decision to reveal and the later public display. Still, pressure stays gentle; no option is starkly foreclosed beyond internal resistance, so the felt price is modest. The resolution arises from her agency and reads earned, if low‑heat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (prove whispers over shouts) is clear and escalates once when the figure beckons and he chooses to follow. The internal and external lines braid, but pressures remain gentle and consequence-light. No real foreclosed alternative is shown on the page; risk remains largely conceptual. The resolution is earned but low-torque.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear (calling back the lost), and the tightening occurs when the device synchronizes and people arrive. Opposition is largely situational; there’s little on-page resistance or trade-off beyond labor and cyclic dimming. The escalation is steady rather than knife-edged. The earned commitment at the end reads as stance crystallization more than a hard-forced choice.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias’s autonomy/psych safety—tightens once via the curse and the dawn constraint, culminating in a clear renunciation. Escalation is coherent but relatively gentle; Mara’s solution arrives without real obstruction, and the ritual works on first try. The price (relinquishing the relic and submitting to a vulnerable ritual) reads, though consequences feel low‑risk. Tension is steady rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are internally focused (meaning of the gesture), with a discernible tightening through the fresh boot print and the journal. Escalation is modest yet coherent under the accumulative lens, deepening knowledge rather than narrowing physical options. The price is primarily conceptual—solitude plus the burden of stewardship—felt but mild. No overt reversal; the pressure rises in subtone rather than clash.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are declared (restore balance; find the doorway) but scarcely tested; events unfold with minimal resistance. The key deepening is informational—the robed figure’s reveal—rather than a pressured choice with trade-offs. Elias’s agency appears, yet consequences remain abstract and pain-free. Escalation never narrows options or forces a loss.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (truth/balance) is signaled early; pressure tightens as the starlight proves alive and exploited. The main turn is knowledge‑driven rather than action‑driven, but it credibly narrows options and forces the vow. Visible cost remains light on the page, making the escalation feel more ethical than perilous. Tension is steady, if not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—whether a moment can be deepened into permanence—is signaled early. Escalation is a single intensification (the shell glowing, the chant), but pressure remains gentle and largely uncontested. There’s no foreclosed option or visible price; the outcome arrives without friction. Tension exists but stays atmospheric rather than choice‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (recovering narrative agency) is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to drift and confront her past selves. The conversation functions as the pressure point that deepens knowledge and narrows options. Escalation is primarily internal, with a credible if gentle price (renouncing envy’s protection). No antagonist needed, but the risk feels safe compared to the setup’s eerie potential.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is internal—can Elara re‑humanize the overlooked and find meaning within loss. Escalation tightens when Mira reveals the backstory and Elara chooses to engage tactilely with the screw, deepening understanding. The price and narrowing are modest, with no hard trade‑off beyond a stance crystallization. Tension is gentle but consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (mastery over fear to practice craft) is clear, with a tightening when the first raindrop triggers the quill’s crystallization. Escalation is modest and resolves quickly once she adopts the superstition-as-grounding tactic. The price is internal—holding through the fear—but external consequences remain low. A slightly sharper reversal or trade-off would deepen pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (reconnection via apology before the orchard falls) tightens through the humming bottle and personal stakes converging. The decisive act—the apology as current—narrows options by choosing acceptance over reparative fantasy. Cost is legible: forgiveness does not avert external loss, only reframes it. Escalation is subtle but real, consistent with the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled (pierce illusion/unify), yet pressure rises softly; there’s minimal narrowing of options or palpable trade-off. The key turn is internal trust in the dictionary and the merger, but no external counterforce tests commitment. Consequences read as uplift rather than costly choice. Escalation is present but mild.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure centers on an internal stake; escalation is modest but present (countdown to discovery to reinterpretation). Agency drives the key turns (he stays, examines, inserts the key) rather than coincidence alone. The visible price or foreclosed path remains soft—no hard trade‑off beyond a worldview pivot—so tension never fully tightens. Still, a meaningful deepening occurs at the parchment reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres and deepens (from disturbance to facing the figure), with one meaningful tightening at the offering. Stakes remain primarily internal, and the price is a shift in stance rather than a tangible loss. The laser pointer suggests a foreclosed path (confrontation) but isn’t tested hard enough to make the trade‑off sting. Tension is steady but not sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is internal: finding an approach to her father’s contradictions. Pressure coheres and gently tightens (midnight, her decision to write), with one clear deepening from observation to commitment. The price—embracing uncertainty and labor over easy answers—is implied rather than dramatized. Lack of external pressure and minimal foreclosed options cap escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—remain safely estranged or risk connection—tightens as the looped calls escalate from eerie to imperative, prompting Eli’s first note and culminating in his outbound call. The melody’s spread increases pressure coherently under the accumulative lens. The price is vulnerability rather than a tangible loss, which slightly softens the edge. Still, the turn is clear and earned by his agency.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes remain largely abstract (honoring stories/covenant) with minimal on‑page pressure. The Mara beat deepens context but is summarized rather than dramatized, so escalation is muted. The ending is a stance crystallization, but no path is foreclosed with cost, and no live option narrows on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (loneliness vs connection) is clear but pressure rises gently, not coercively. The main tightening is the act of touching the clock, which delivers a solution rather than testing her through loss or trade-off. Little is foreclosed; the struggle feels frictionless. Internal and external strands align but never squeeze her options.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are articulated early (mapping inner terrain) and the melody’s call tightens focus, but external and internal resistance remain minimal. The journey proceeds without reversal or trade‑off beyond endurance. The closure is earned, yet the price feels light, with no option truly foreclosed on the page. Tension is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (stabilize/understand the anomaly) is signaled early and there is one meaningful tightening when the hum compels entry and the pen warms in response. Escalation is mostly smooth; resistance is minimal, with little cost or narrowing of options beyond stepping into the void. The decisive act is her writing, which resolves matters without a counterforce testing commitment. Tension is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—giving voice to silence—intensifies through a clear pattern break (impossible camera click) that reweights Elara’s tactics. Pressure remains inward but coherent, shifting from mapping to shaping. The on-page price is mostly conceptual/emotional, not a sharp trade-off, keeping escalation tasteful but muted. Resolution flows from her renewed agency rather than luck.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is stated early, but pressure barely tightens; every clue yields without resistance. The sole meaningful deepening is the near‑invisible door, which opens easily. The final act is a straightforward retrieval and translation with minimal price. Escalation feels smooth rather than testing.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming agency/meaning) is legible, and the ripple→hum→realization sequence provides one decisive deepening. Pressure remains interior and gentle; consequences are conceptual rather than confrontational. The tightening moment (lagoon synchrony) changes options/knowledge credibly, but the price paid is soft on the page. Still, her final decision arises from her agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (prove subtlety/penetrate the forbidden center) escalates via the storm, the sentient maze, and the blocking wall. The challenge from Mira provides a meaningful tightening that requires decisive agency (the key turn). Prices remain mostly atmospheric; a specific forfeiture or consequence would deepen impact. Still, tension scales at sentence and beat levels.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are quiet but legible: can the guardian transmute the stranger’s darkness into a flicker of light. Escalation is a steady density increase—motion of shutters, the stranger’s approach and confession—culminating in the completed pattern. The price is understated (guardian’s self‑effacement and labor toward a modest change); no hard foreclosed path is articulated. Still, the cadence shift at the final shutter click qualifies.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake (seed second thoughts via synchronized displays) is clear but largely uncontested. There’s no tangible loss, reversal, or narrowed option—success arrives without friction. The grotto deepens mood rather than tightening pressure. The climax reads as fulfillment by plan, not a tested stance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (freedom via self‑acceptance) is signaled early and tightens at the barrier, forcing a trade‑off (key vs access). The decisive act of letting go narrows options and exacts a price. External pressure is low, but internal pressure escalates cleanly under the chosen lens. A touch more friction or jeopardy would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—preserving authentic grief under enforced joy—is clear, and pressure coheres. Escalation is modest: the brother’s backstory deepens stakes, and the window touch marks the small tightening before the closing placement. The price remains mostly conceptual and internal, with no external test to narrow options further. Still, the final resolve forecloses overt expression, an earned endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—crossing sacred boundaries—is signaled early and escalates through sensory intensification and the lake’s transformation. The tightening is gentle; the choice to surrender identity costs something, but pressure remains mostly lyrical rather than oppositional. Resolution grows from the poet’s agency (touching, speaking, letting go). A credible deepening, if not a sharp foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.9)
    The pressure coheres around whether he can bridge what he cannot see; escalation arrives when the reed awakens and he leverages plant-arrangement as a tactic. The tightening is singular but effective for the length. Stakes remain largely internal with minimal visible price, limiting peak intensity. Resolution follows from his active use of the environment and tools.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.0)
    Pressure rises through an accumulation of sonic memories rather than a narrowing of options; there’s no on‑page obstacle to test resolve. The dominant stake (recovering connection) stays mostly abstract, with one cadence shift when the hum reveals duality. The final stance is chosen rather than forced, with limited visible price. Escalation is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (moving from paralysis to purpose) is clear, and pressure coheres around the illumination forcing a choice. The escalation is a single decisive intensification rather than a series, fitting the length. The price—embracing a permanent mark and the burden of purpose—is implied but not contested at length, keeping the turn slightly soft. Still, agency drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering whether the crash was engineered—is clear and tightened by the collaborative analysis. Escalation moves from suspicion to a mapped conspiracy, but prices paid remain mostly off-page or light. The meaningful turn is the reframe of the Tower from omen to blueprint, reweighting stakes rather than foreclosing options. The piece lacks a hard trade-off or immediate cost to close the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure escalates modestly from enigma to discovery to activation, driven by Elara’s choices. The dominant stake (risking sanity/innocence for knowledge) is clear but remains largely internal. The tightening is real (pattern of absence leading to the spoken word) yet the felt price at peak is soft. No reversal beyond the reveal, but sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—what to do with the shadow—tightens decisively at the vial’s discovery and embodiment of the shadow. The meaningful turn is Elara’s choice to give it form rather than reject/destroy it, with a felt trade‑off. Pressure is coherent but mostly internal; absence of palpable resistance or time pressure softens escalation. Nevertheless, the deepening is clear and the resolution is protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—recovering trust/identity post-con—is present but the pressure largely remains internal and reflective. Escalation manifests as a tonal tightening when the tail tip’s meaning shifts from betrayal to resilience. The cost is implied rather than viscerally tested, and no option is forcefully foreclosed on the page. The cadence deepens once, but tension remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (recovering a “displaced miracle”/self-closure) is legible, and pressure increases by moving from study → descent → confrontation with the double hourglass. However, escalation is low-friction—no true foreclosed options or hard trade-offs, and the miracle reunites without resistance. The urgency is declared rather than tested, limiting felt stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (locating unused love) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as the film reveals goodbye letters merging. The escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than a hard reversal, suited to the chosen lens. The decision to take the strip is an earned tightening, but the felt price remains understated. A clearer foreclosed path or consequence would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early (recover creativity to revive the village) and pressure coheres as the cosmic signals intensify. The tightening is a deepening of pattern density rather than a trade-off; the “rest” choice reframes tempo but doesn’t visibly close a door. The final readiness is earned but lightly priced. Lack of tangible opposition or loss on the page keeps the stakes abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are signaled early, but pressure never bites; the archive revives without meaningful resistance. The charm and clock work on first try, and there’s no credible trade‑off or foreclosed option. The final shift to “protect their divergence” reframes, but doesn’t cost her anything yet. Escalation reads as a smooth reveal rather than a tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering insight—tightens modestly from diffuse searching to the purposeful act of following the wind’s song and engaging the machine. The main narrowing arrives when he chooses to insert the gear; prior phenomena serve as accumulating pressure rather than concrete obstacles. The price paid is mostly conceptual; escalation is satisfying but gentle. No antagonist needed, but the on‑page cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is early and coherent: will she traverse and claim her courage. Pressure tightens through the ascent and the ferryman’s second appearance, culminating in Mara choosing to “use it.” The price is mostly internal and quiet; escalation is more deepening than narrowing. Strong, if not blistering, under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around whether to sustain silence as safety or transform it, with the bolt encounter tightening options. The discovery raises stakes by revealing the fortress’s true purpose (fear) and forcing a stance. The cost is primarily conceptual—breaking ritual to play—rather than materially punitive. Escalation is real but gentle, consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes (unmask the pretender) are clear early, and pressure coheres as Elara forces responses through increasingly bold placements. The pretender’s shift from defiance to desperation marks escalation. The climax is brief and low‑resistance; Elara’s victory comes swiftly with minimal price. A single deeper complication or trade‑off would sharpen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake is her need to make meaning from the torn page and its implications for her work; escalation is a gentle tightening from curiosity to research to insight. The “alarm chime” and data upload add cadence but not true pressure, and the cost remains abstract. One meaningful deepening occurs when the watermark and fossil site context click. Without a harder trade‑off, stakes never fully bite.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on whether she will reengage the rebellion with renewed meaning; the pressure coheres as the hum deepens and the vision reframes options. The key tightening is internal—confidence transforms to resolve—appropriate for the lens. However, a visible trade‑off or foreclosed alternative is largely implied, not explicit. Tension is steady but quiet, with limited on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible (cultural restoration under a repressive regime), and the unsealing is a meaningful tightening. However, escalation is soft: the guard’s conflict dissipates quickly, and the decoding/unsealing face minimal resistance. The cost at peak is largely visionary rather than consequential. One credible obstacle or trade-off during the ritual would clarify price.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (retrieve the photo without losing it—or herself) is clear and tightens with the slip at the edge. The escalation is believable and character‑driven, and luck doesn’t resolve it; her trained bodily response matters. The price paid is mostly internal; physical cost remains hypothetical, softening the impact slightly. Still, the moment forecloses a passive, grief‑stalled path.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (recovering the capacity to make art without control) is signaled early and tightens as she reorders the cards and reframes The Tower. The meaningful turn is the decision to redesign by disorder and to ascend without the box, trading the old frame for a riskier acceptance. Costs are mostly internal, but the relinquishment is clear and felt. Escalation is quiet and accumulative rather than conflictual; still, pressure coheres to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (understanding vs control) is clear and escalates when Elara risks touching the vial to confront the truth. The price is emotional exposure and acceptance rather than physical jeopardy. Pressure grows once, cleanly, at the vision turn; no true reversal or tightened trade‑off beyond that. Effective but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early: reveal suppressed truths versus uphold duty. Escalation tightens through the seal break, deeper descent, and a ticking alert window that narrows options. The cost is internalized and credible; however, opposition is largely atmospheric, with no on‑page complication beyond the clock. Resolution derives from her agency and forecloses her prior path.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear—preserve the sanctuary against encroaching chaos—and pressure coheres when Kael’s warning forces Elara’s weapon choice. The main tightening is the acceptance of the blade and the commitment to stay, but on‑page cost remains mostly conceptual. Fortification arrives as montage rather than friction that forecloses options. Tension holds but never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake is legible early, and the pressure coheres around pattern disruption and retrieval of the echo. The true tightening is the goddess’s sudden appearance and the spike’s revealed use; Kael’s agency is present but soft, with limited trade-offs dramatized. The cost (accepting echo over presence) is felt but underplayed. Tension operates more as cadence than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (expose state surveillance) is clear, but escalation occurs mostly via told discoveries. The meeting with the director should be a pressure spike; instead it’s recounted, diffusing cost. The night return and small defiance are good beats, yet the visible price remains low. Internal tension (drive vs. fear) is stated rather than tested by a consequential trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—hushing guilt/dissonance—is clear, with pressure tightening through the discovery of letters and the ethically fraught response choice. The internal conflict (soothe vs. impersonate) intersects with the external firmware pressure. Consequences are primarily internal and occur quickly, reducing felt risk. Still, the turn is earned and alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and coherently pressured: the hush deepens, symbols emerge, and the “hand” image tightens urgency. The decisive beat is her choice to honor the silence rather than impose meaning. The price is interior and modest; stakes never bite physically or interpersonally. Still, escalation reads as a persuasive cadence shift for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (redefining mercy) is mostly internal and thematic; on‑page pressure rises gently through the act of rebuilding the mosaic. The tightening is present—choosing to act on a small, overlooked tessera as an ethos—but the cost and foreclosed alternatives remain abstract. No antagonist or concrete barrier counters her action, muting escalation. The final “beacon of hope” reweights, but without a tested trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (salvaging possibility from despair) are evident, and the tightening occurs when the double appears and takes the coin, shifting the garden. Escalation remains gentle: no substantial obstacle or counterforce tests Mara’s commitment. The price is mostly conceptual (ongoing haunting, bittersweet separation) rather than a felt on-page loss. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but stays low-intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—how to respond to the telepathy recall—is declared and pursued via making, but escalation is gentle. One tightening occurs as she commits to an all‑night build and centers the geode; no live option is starkly foreclosed and no significant visible price is paid on the page. Pressure accrues texturally rather than through reversal or consequence. The ending’s stance is earned but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on discovery and meaning, but pressure is gentle; little is foreclosed or risked. Escalation exists (fossil floats higher, leads to deepest chamber), yet consequences for refusal or error aren’t dramatized. Agency is present in her following and placement choice, but no real trade‑off is tested. The result reads more wondrous than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (unlock the echo’s truth) is clear, and pressure modestly tightens with the bone‑button discovery and the chorus. However, the piece lacks a credible obstacle or trade‑off on the page; risk and price remain mostly conceptual. Escalation is a smooth swell rather than a tested commitment with a visible loss.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (recover courage to “fix what’s broken”) is clear, with a tightening at the discovery of the letter and the pill decision. Escalation is measured rather than sharp; pressure coheres but the visible price is modest. The choice to proceed without the pill reads as a trade‑off (prudence vs. daring) yet remains low‑risk on the page. Tension works more through cadence shift than direct jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is the realization under a ticking clock; pressure coheres but remains soft. The meaningful tightening is the figure’s arrival and the time limit nearing its end. Cost and foreclosed options are lightly felt—success avoids loss rather than choosing among competing harms. Escalation reads as a cadence shift more than a test.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake (understanding why the oasis resists change) is clear, and the tightening occurs when the glass aligns and reconfigures meaning. Yet pressure remains gentle; there’s little that forecloses options or exacts a price. Coincidence doesn’t resolve the story, but escalation is more reveal than test. The community sequence resolves smoothly without a visible trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Pressure grows gently (boat’s approach; matching carvings), but stakes remain largely tonal and relational. The meaningful tightening is the reveal of the lockmaster and the object match; options narrow to a vulnerable exchange. The on‑page price is soft—no foreclosed alternate path beyond keeping the tooth. Tension operates more as hush and expectancy than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes (whether she claims the legacy) are signaled early, but escalation remains smooth rather than tightening; the door opens on first try, and the orb grants visions without contest. The meaningful deepening is the shift from hum to direct communion, but it doesn’t force a trade‑off on the page. Cost is implied (abandoning solitude), not felt as a tested loss. The piece resolves via acceptance rather than a pressured choice.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (find the connecting thread) is legible early and escalates through approach, placement, and revelation. Pressure is gentle but coherent; the decisive move is hers, with a paid price (leaving the talisman). The lack of strong counter‑pressure or risk keeps tension modest. Still, the cadence shift at activation delivers a clear tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (restore control without provoking the senders) is established and tightened by Elara’s strategic choice to use a counter-frequency. Her act produces a turn (signal unravels), followed by a price (community fracture, sponsor risk) that complicates victory. Pressure remains coherent, though the protests don’t force a second on‑page adaptation. Costs are real but not punishingly acute.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (retrieve the key without being swallowed by space) is clear and escalates when the chamber actively contracts. The decisive tightening is her choice to embrace the mutiny, converting fear into agency to alter the environment. Costs are primarily psychological but legible in the squeeze-through and panic crest. The “world‑reshaping” stakes stay conceptual, slightly muting pressure scale.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure coheres around whether to confront the figure or transmute the encounter into art; arming with the lancing tool raises risk perception. The meaningful tightening is the figure’s appearance with an identical ribbon, and the narrowing choice is her pivot to sketching rather than chase. Stakes remain mostly internal and the cost is largely conceptual, keeping the escalation modest. A concrete external price or loss would have deepened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres from investigation to activation to a forced dilemma, with a clear tightening at the stanza “Where earth meets sky…”. Agency drives the turns; coincidence doesn’t resolve anything. Stakes remain somewhat abstract at the peak—the cost of either option isn’t concretely rendered—so the dilemma’s teeth are dulled. The resolution feels earned but low on visible sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on deciphering the hitchhiker’s secret, with escalation via terrain and pattern recognition leading to the hidden structure. Pressure remains mostly internal and procedural; opposition is minimal, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. The final act (raising the fiddle) resolves in affirmation without a visible price. Effective tightening exists, but tension never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is introspective; escalation is modest: the journal adds context and the partner encounter provides the lone on‑page pressure point (dissuasion). The turn doesn’t force a hard trade‑off or visible price, so tension remains low. The closure choice (to leave with understanding) is earned but lacks a felt loss or foreclosed path beyond sentiment. Pressure coheres but doesn’t tighten sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (decoding inscriptions/inner repair) are stated early, and discovery escalates from pattern to constellation to thematic plea. Pressure remains low; no option is foreclosed or materially risked, so the tightening reads primarily as understanding rather than cost. The resolution follows naturally from accumulation but lacks a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (stabilize the vortex and uncover hidden truth) is signaled early and coheres through a single tightening: her surrender escalates to the confession that forecloses denial. Internal and external pressures interweave at the center where the seed activates. The emotional price is legible but light; no credible loss beyond self‑image is shown. After the turn, resolution arrives swiftly with little friction.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stakes are declared (restore a shattered bond), but escalation is gentle; the maze yields rather than resists, and no real option is foreclosed. The key turn is simply heeding the maze and placing the clipping, which resolves matters without reversal or meaningful sacrifice. Pressure remains coherent yet low; anxiety registers more as atmosphere than as tested risk. The result reads achieved rather than earned under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (freedom vs self‑bound purpose) and escalate via the warning sign and shadow‑self confrontation. The meaningful tightening is the price‑due ultimatum leading to her renunciation. Still, pressure feels cushioned: the antagonist force doesn’t force a painful trade beyond naming it, and options don’t visibly narrow beyond her ethos. The choice reads firm but not harrowed.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (purpose after public failure) is clear, with a single meaningful tightening at the window when the cloth reweights meaning. Conflict is internal; pressure coheres but remains low‑grade, without a concrete external pinch or trade‑off. The final choice is earned by pattern, though the price is modest. Tension works more in cadence than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are primarily internal—understanding vs. fear—signaled early and modestly tightened when the seed glows and she must act. After planting, resistance collapses; visions arrive without real price or setback, and nurturing proceeds smoothly. The climax lacks a hard trade‑off or visible consequence, softening escalation. Quiet is fine, but tension never truly bites.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear (stabilize migrating identities), but pressure never tightens into a hard trade‑off; no tactic fails or forces visible sacrifice during the process. Resolution flows from competence plus a guiding aphorism rather than a costed decision under duress. The new configuration implies price, but escalation on the page is low‑heat. A single decisive tightening or loss would raise this substantially.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain largely abstract (unity, hope) and the pressure is gentle; little resists Elara once she commits. The tightening beat—placing the pearl—alters knowledge and options but not at visible cost. Time pressure (“heartbeat of a hesitation”) is named but never bites tactically. Tension accrues atmospherically rather than through hard trade‑offs.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) is present early and tightens when the graffiti “The river knows” and the man’s comment force Elara to confront mapping her past rather than others’. The choice to trace her self-map constitutes the meaningful deepening, with the price of facing unfiltered memory. Pressure is primarily internal; no antagonist, but coherence holds under the accumulative lens. Slight softness in turn intensity keeps it below elite scores.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (find the answer) is signaled and progresses to the desk and countdown. The notable tightening is the watch ticking backward and the need to document before the library closes. Opposition is low; pressure remains atmospheric more than adversarial. The price paid is mostly conceptual, so escalation lacks a sharper trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stakes (dream vs. Dominion control) are signaled early and escalate as scouts close in. The coffee omen and balcony shift mark a clear tightening, culminating in a costly act that forecloses options (the violin’s sacrifice). Pressure is coherent; agency drives resolution. A sharper on‑page risk to Elara’s body could have further heightened immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: preserve a spark vs. yield to stillness. Pressure tightens with the chip’s use, the traveler’s counter-ethos, and Elara’s kneeling request to be taught. The price is a relinquished mission/identity, but its consequence stays largely interior. A more acute on-page cost or foreclosed alternative would raise the charge.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    The primary pressure is internal—will she risk seeing all her lives to find peace—and escalates from discovery to immersion. However, obstacles are minimal and there’s little resistance or consequence beyond a brief implied emotional cost. The magical guide’s appearance eases the path, and stakes remain abstract rather than viscerally tested. The tightening is present but not demanding.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.3)
    Dominant stake (help Mara shed doubt) is declared but pressure remains low; there’s minimal tightening beyond the chime “code” prompting a letter. No meaningful option is foreclosed, and the cost of the chosen stance is not clearly felt on the page. The piece resolves via a planned response rather than a tested commitment under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres as an internal conflict: whether to break her long practice of withholding. Escalation arrives via trance intensification and the second, symbol‑etched stone that precipitates speaking. The felt price is largely internal; we don’t see public blowback, which slightly mutes stakes. Still, one meaningful tightening is achieved at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (appraise the arrowhead via birds) is clear, with pressure gently tightening when the flock appears and patterns coalesce. Escalation is more meditative density than test; risk, opposition, or loss are almost absent. The turn to “compass” knowledge is a deepening, not a narrowing with price. The cost of choosing stillness remains largely thematic rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (claim/understand the keystone) is legible, and pressure tightens with the closing walls. The main reversal—using the harness to mist walk—arrives promptly but with little attrition or trade‑off; the solution works on first try. Consequence is primarily conceptual, not lived, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. The escalation is coherent but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure escalates from curiosity to discovery to commitment, but the turn costs little—he faces no resistance beyond wonder. The key’s “choosing him” externalizes pressure and reduces agency-tested stakes. The vow functions as a deepening rather than a hard trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are immense but remain abstract on the page; the process succeeds without obstacle, reversal, or trade‑off. The one tightening—coin immersion revealing prophecy fragments—broadens options rather than narrowing them. No felt price is paid to secure the turn. Tension is more tonal than situational, limiting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (recovering purpose) is legible early and deepens through the naming sequence. Escalation is primarily tonal/density‑based rather than adversarial; pressure coheres as the ritual awakens and the voices crescendo. The visible price is mainly emotional acceptance; limited external resistance keeps tension from peaking higher. The final choice—reclaiming the scythe and carrying the names—feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes are clear—tilting the world back toward balance—but on‑page pressure is mostly procedural and contemplative. The meaningful tightening arrives when the reassembled bell yields only a dull thud, yet Eliard must commit anyway; hanging it produces the turn. The escalation is coherent but gentle, with little opposing force beyond brittleness and time. Costs remain symbolic rather than materially punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering communal memory—is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens; discovery flows to exhibition with no meaningful obstacle or trade‑off. The one turn is a deepening (finding the bottle) rather than a narrowing with cost. Resolution is earned by initiative, not tested against resistance. Tension stays low and steady.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is present (bridge logic/intuition; secure the crystal), but pressure is gentle and largely invitational. The main tightening is her hesitation before placing the crystal, which doesn’t meaningfully foreclose alternatives or impose price. External resistance is negligible; no persistent constraint changes tactics. Tension operates more as hush and awe than risk.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.3)
    Stakes (“preserve trust by restoring order”) remain abstract; no on-page barrier forces a trade-off or loss. The “revise understanding” beat is a turn, but it isn’t earned by preceding complications that narrow options. Pressure doesn’t tighten; it plateaus into lyrical observation until the pattern simply appears. Cost is stated rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes (recovering feeling by integrating or releasing the Duplicate) are signaled early and tightened through the duel. The decisive turn—choosing to shatter the jar—narrows options and resolves the internal standoff. The visible price is lightly rendered (erasure of the separate Duplicate) rather than deeply felt, muting intensity. Pressure remains coherent and grows to a clear endpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates from curiosity to experimentation to a risky, irreversible act (releasing the key into the brook). Stakes remain mostly conceptual—safeguarding innovation and answering a summons—so the cost feels light even as options narrow. The protagonist’s agency drives the major turns. The conflict never bites hard enough to force a painful trade-off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible from the outset and escalates via accumulative intensification: lullabies + mechanical whine → crescendo → exhale. The felt price (exhaustion, refusal to stop “until the last note had been sung”) narrows options credibly. Opposition is largely atmospheric rather than agentive; there’s no hard reversal, but the cadence shift reads as a meaningful tightening. The faint laughter is an earned, non‑coincidental outcome of his sustained tactic.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake—go home using the pendant or protect garden/library—tightens when the cost is named. The reversal is inward but real: she shifts from ache toward chosen endurance. The price is explicit (losing the chance to return now; continued ache) and it reweights the scene’s options. Additional complicating beats could heighten pressure, but what’s here is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—interrupting a destiny of failure—stays coherent and culminates when she chooses transformation over resurrection. Escalation occurs via a single tightening (using the broken crozier as seed), but external resistance is minimal and the price is mostly symbolic. The internal conflict resolves smoothly with little pushback or trade-off beyond renunciation. The beat structure is clean but lacks a sharper test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake is legible: successfully tune the shard at perigee. The major tightening is the shard dimming after a misassumption, forcing adaptation (discarding the “finite power” belief). Costs remain largely conceptual; no strong trade‑off or lost option is dramatized. Tension is steady but not teethy.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake is clear (restore the ferry/passengers) and intensifies as she chooses to enter the rift and then to reset time at personal cost. The transient’s warning offers a brief crucible; the tighter escalation comes from the physical/mental strain in the rift. The price is present but could be sharper or more consequential on the page. Still, the narrowing of options reads coherent and agent‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake (connection vs self-unraveling) is present early and tightens when the shadow figure questions her goal. The decisive escalation is her recommitment to weave “more intricate, more daring” despite risk, leading to the touch and the gallery’s dissolution. The price is felt but remains mostly conceptual rather than materially narrowing options. Tension operates, though not with sharp trade-offs beyond the central renunciation of safety.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve navigational heritage by integrating it) is legible early. The tightening is gentle: Council threat sparks Elara’s ritual and community demonstration. Resolution (“towers remained”) arrives without on‑page confrontation or visible price; escalation plateaus into montage. The lack of a concrete loss or trade‑off limits pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on recovering and honoring a silenced voice, but pressure escalates only modestly: stronger pulses, thicker mist, a straightforward find. There’s no meaningful foreclosed option or visible price; threat remains abstract. The turn (“Protect her story”) affirms rather than complicates her drive. Tension is present but gentle, limiting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are legible early (get the codex to confront what took Voss; survive the claustrophobic gauntlet) and escalate at the fleck-triggered phase shift. The tightening is meaningful but not punishing: the vault opens with effort, the transition happens quickly, and exit costs little beyond fear. The internal and external strands interweave, but an additional complication or trade-off on return would deepen price. As is, pressure coheres but stays moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes (reclaiming/understanding her existence) are signaled early and escalate as the ink patterns align and the radio voice arrives. The meaningful tightening comes with the ghost’s materialization and the acceptance that the alternate timeline is a record. The price is more reflective than practical, with limited on-page trade-offs or foreclosed options. Still, internal and external threads cohere, and agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible early (save the language), with escalation via rising echo density, discovered melody, and the curse’s drain. The key tightening is the cost intensifying as she speaks; the shattering diamond forecloses options credibly. Tension integrates internal drive and external pressure without gimmicks. It’s strong, if largely a single arc without reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is clear (recovering the arrowhead/answering the cryptid question) and tightens when the phone commands metamorphosis and the garden seals her path. The reversal into the alcove narrows options and forces stance crystallization. The cost is largely internal and could read sharper on the page. Escalation remains coherent and resolves via renunciation rather than conquest.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are signaled early (beauty vs. mechanized order), and escalation is clear: statues notice, approach, and are countered via an intentional, risky tactic. The meaningful tightening is Elara choosing to merge her heartbeat with the orchard’s, foreclosing safer passivity. Visible price is relatively small (shell’s inertness, physical danger without injury), but the trade‑off is legible. The resolution follows from her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (deliver the bottle to broker a truce) and pressure escalates via active chase and surveillance sweeps. One meaningful tightening occurs when the patrol drone spots Luma and the narrow crevice becomes the only option. The resolution lands but exacts little visible price, softening the peak’s bite. Stakes never feel abstract, but the risk resolves too cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure escalates from curiosity to a consequential act as the bells draw him inward and the fragment warms, prompting singing. Stakes remain largely internal and thematic; opposition is minimal and the cost of acting is not sharply rendered. The cadence shift at the song/light moment qualifies as a meaningful tightening under the chosen lens. A clearer felt price (risk of failure, harm, or surrendering silence) would heighten stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early; escalation proceeds via increasing geometric complexity culminating in the children’s section, which provides the clearest pressure point. The price is an internal one—accepting stewardship—which reads, though external jeopardy is mild. The moment of the place “fading” gives the necessary squeeze, but a sharper trade‑off on the page would elevate the tension. Still, agency drives the turns.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (translating longing into creation) is signaled early, and pressure deepens as light becomes anomalously “alive.” Escalation is primarily textural; there’s one meaningful tightening when the light’s patterns prompt her to act, then to paint over the photo. Prices are implied (letting go, time/effort) rather than dramatized as trade‑offs that foreclose options. Tension remains gentle, never forcing a sharp sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (freeing an idea that could save/destroy) is declared early, but on‑page pressure tightens minimally: the living lock “resists” then yields after a single phrase. The central choice to release the idea is bold but faces little friction or trade‑off in scene. The risk is told more than felt, and no option is foreclosed visibly post‑act.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are focused (recover stolen memories), and pressure tightens with the missing mushroom and the locket reveal. Escalation is primarily discovery-based; no option is foreclosed with a visible price. The cadence shift at the star alignment is strong but risk‑free. A concrete trade‑off or threatened loss would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (free the shadow/enable reversible exile) are legible, but pressure escalates quietly rather than through a decisive narrowing. The main tightening is the moment the leaves’ patterns cohere and the shadow responds. The price of failure/success is implied more than dramatized; conflict remains internal and soft‑edged.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes remain abstract (preserve wonder) and face little concrete opposition. The sole tightening is Elara choosing “this is the moment” to plant, but no option is truly foreclosed and no price is paid. Pressure does not grow; the outcome reads preordained. Escalation, under an accumulative lens, lacks a decisive intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (free the spirits through the net) is clear, with a meaningful tightening at the “stubborn knot” that resists and elicits a plea. The escalation is primarily density and resistance rather than reversal, culminating in the flood of whispers and release. Emotional cost is legible (weariness, trembling), though the stakes never quite force a hard trade‑off. Quiet, coherent pressure fits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (uncover the chapel) is clear, and a meaningful tightening occurs when Elara spots the light discrepancy and commits to excavation. However, pressure remains gentle with minimal resistance or visible trade-offs beyond time and effort. The resolution arrives without a live cost or foreclosed path that bites on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are primarily internal (how to let go), with one meaningful deepening as the map leads to the letter and reframes the globe. Pressure grows gently; no sharp narrowing or loss forces difficult tactics. The agency at closure is a renunciation rather than a hard trade-off, so cost remains subtle. Effective for a quiet piece, but not intensely escalatory.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are singular: free the ghost before the storm’s window closes. Pressure rises through the encoding cadence and the lightning/thunder clock, culminating in manifestation and release. The escalation is steady but lacks a sharp reversal or visible loss beyond the necessary parting. Still, agency drives the turn and the ending is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    Pressure remains soft; the main stake is internal and faces little external resistance. There is meaningful deepening via clues and the riddle, but no true narrowing that forecloses options or exacts a price. The key acquisition and decryption are smooth, with minimal jeopardy or trade‑off. Escalation is more scenic than tense.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes clarify early (stranded, message in clouds; validating her theory), and pressure coheres as the glowing cumulus approaches. The decisive tightening is stepping onto the railing and committing to the jump. Cost is present but underplayed; she lands with benefits and no lasting loss on the page. Still, the escalation cadence fits the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (complete the sky-book under demolition pressure) is clear, with one meaningful tightening at the discovery and opening of the safe. However, escalation is muted—“Hours passed, or perhaps minutes” blunts the live clock, and there’s no reversal beyond the late shudder. Consequences are minimal; success arrives without a trade-off besides ambient risk. Tension works but never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure rises from interpretation to exploration to discovery, with a meaningful tightening at the beam’s appearance and the hidden hatch. Stakes remain primarily intellectual/aspirational (charting discovery) rather than materially risky, so cost feels low. Agency drives each turn, not coincidence. A single deepening suffices, but adding a real risk or trade‑off would sharpen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure escalates from decoding to confrontation with altered reflections, but resistance is minimal and options never narrow dangerously. The mirrors’ vortex implies risk without extracting a cost or forcing a trade-off. The dominant stake—find the gear/learn the rhythm—resolves without true jeopardy. Tension is present, yet it plateaus quickly after she grabs the gears.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    Stakes are declared (restore the nebula) but escalation is gentle, with no genuine setback or trade‑off; solutions appear conveniently (Jorin remembers; bronze is available). The tightening from clearing overgrowth to ringing the bell lacks a costful choice. Elara’s fade is a late emotional price but doesn’t arise from a contested decision. Pressure stays coherent yet low.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is explicit early: hold the world together by mending the relic before “midnight.” Escalation occurs via density and cadence—beam falters, hush thickens, her lullaby breaks—forcing a recommitment at cost. The blood price and renewed pressure give the turn teeth. The conflict is more atmospheric than antagonistic, but the single tightening reads.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stakes (save a traveler; nudge the curse) are set early and tighten when the birds arrive and the map unlocks a viable path. The meaningful deepening is the assembled blueprint that changes options mid‑story. The price is mainly risk and endurance; no major foreclosed option is paid on‑page, keeping the ceiling below elite. Still, escalation reads coherent and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant internal stake is clear and tight, and the pressure coheres through a single meaningful deepening when her observation of foam recasts her options. Escalation is gentle—no antagonist or sharp foreclosing—but the commitment to move from refuge to reconnection reads as a narrowed path. A felt price is implied rather than dramatized. The closing agency is a stance crystallization rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (recover and use the anomalous vial to locate “where stories begin”) is clear and tightens at the incision and the blank‑book reveal. The cost of expending the vial is legible; the pressure curve is steady rather than bracing, with no strong reversal. Accumulative lens escalation reads as a density/cadence lift at the uncorking.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (can she transform concentrated remorse without being undone) is clear and tightens as she moves from jagged wall etchings to the heart shard. The escalation is a clean deepening rather than a reversal, with one decisive intensification at the shard. Cost is felt but not punishing; her success feels largely assured. Still, agency drives the turn and the price recharges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (reuniting the community) is clear and escalates through density of voices and the clock’s reawakening. However, resistance is soft; there’s little friction or credible obstacle testing her commitment beyond inertia. The tightening is a single swell rather than a pressured trade-off, so cost remains abstract. Still, the chime and Mr. Kovar’s story provide a satisfying apex.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are largely internal and thematic; pressure deepens rather than tightens, with limited cost or narrowing of options. The key turn is the mirror’s activation and her vow, but no on‑page loss or foreclosed path is dramatized beyond intention. The risk to her mind is named, not tested. As a result, escalation feels modest.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure rises modestly with the inversion and drifting through newly visible passages, but obstacles are minimal and solutions come without resistance. The manuscript catch is the only micro‑jeopardy; the pedestal sequence lacks friction or price. Stakes stay abstract (future vigilance) rather than tested in scene. Escalation under the causal lens never forces a trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (unlock the sculpture’s hidden music) are signaled early and deepen through the working session. Pressure accrues texturally via attention, time passing, and the insulator’s strange “amplifying” presence, though explicit opposition is minimal. The decisive tightening is the night’s limited window culminating at dawn, with the hedgehog as a soft clock. The price is effort and vulnerability rather than a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether she can repurpose silence and redefine her path—is signaled early. Pressure coheres via the nexus intensification and the board’s living response, culminating in the king’s toppling. However, escalation lacks a concrete price beyond an internal reframing; options don’t visibly narrow so much as clarify. The sacrifice motif helps, but consequences remain largely conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake (recovering the grandmother’s silences) is signaled, but escalation is modest and risk‑free. The clasp opens without setback or trade‑off, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. Tension is lyrical rather than pressurized, yielding a gentle swell instead of a tightening coil.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (seeking wisdom/serenity vs. ambition) is legible, and escalation arrives when the sprout emits scent, forcing a stance shift. The tightening is singular but meaningful for this length. The price—relinquishing a narrow definition of success—is present yet soft. No antagonist needed; pressure coheres under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are signaled early (find the source or the planet’s resilience fades), but pressure scarcely tightens; the inversion arrives without complicating the task, and the map conveniently clarifies everything. The main turn—using the tip to activate the monolith—faces no resistance and extracts no visible price. Escalation is more scenic than adversarial, so tension never crests into a hard choice. The resolution reads earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around uncovering cause; an authentic tightening occurs at the aircraft discovery and the dial pointing into the storm. Stakes remain conceptual—responsibility and foresight—rather than forcing a present‑tense trade‑off. Agency is mostly investigative attention and endurance. The felt cost lands, but escalation lacks a live obstacle or dangerous choice.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are declared early (certify wonder, precise timing) but escalation remains smooth and largely unopposed. The live clock tightens the start, yet there’s no hard trade‑off or credible loss that alters tactics. The middle does not introduce a complication; success proceeds as expected. The climax is luminous but low-pressure, limiting consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (use the relic without repeating catastrophe). Pressure tightens modestly from approach to the hum’s pull and the decision to play. The reversal is a world‑cross, but the cost remains mostly anticipated, not paid. Stakes feel earnest but under‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (unlock empathy without dissolving self) is signaled early and tightens when he chooses disorientation, then contact, triggering the overwhelming flood. The cost is legible and alters stance; he regains ground with a changed understanding. Escalation is more internal than external but coherent and sufficient at this length. A small additional constraint or trade‑off could further sharpen the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (deliver the relic vs. being transformed by it) is coherent, and pressure increases via the pendant’s intensifying hum and the scholar’s stance. Escalation is primarily informational; Elara’s agency is modest beyond persistence and the handoff. The reveal tightens meaning but doesn’t force a visible trade‑off on the page. The cost is thematic, not materially foreclosing a path in‑scene.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on whether the prism will yield an emotional truth; tension rises from initial blankness to painful resonance. The key deepening is the discovery of the glassblower’s grief, which narrows Elara’s options from analytic proof toward an ethical/humane response. The price is internal (humility, burden), not a hard trade-off. A slightly clearer foreclosed path would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (connection across time/distance) are signaled early and deepen as the bead warms and the world grows stranger; the puzzle’s “final piece” is a clean tightening. The conflict is gently pressured rather than oppositional; coincidence complicates but doesn’t resolve. The decisive step onto the bridge is earned and carries a visible price, though escalation relies more on atmosphere than hard constraint. Strong, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake is clear and escalates coherently, culminating in the weaving at the core. However, the treacherous mines function more as declared pressure than on-page obstacles, yielding little in-scene tightening. The cost is mostly internal and conceptual, not pressed through a specific loss during the journey. Resolution is earned but almost frictionless in execution.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (learn the truth) is signaled early, but escalation is gentle and largely delivered by coincidence and guidance rather than pressure. The key tightening—combining shards—faces no resistance or trade‑off on the page. Cost is anticipated (“heavier than you imagine”) but not paid in scene. Tension stays conceptual more than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure coheres from a technical hiccup to an existential mandate, with one clear tightening via the hidden compartment reveal. Stakes remain focused on safeguarding the beacon, but conflict is largely internal and never tests him against a concrete external limit. The price of choosing guardianship is felt but not stressed. The escalation is steady rather than bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (control the beam to face the fog’s unknown) tightens when the beam veers and the Herald must choose to steer into resistance. Escalation is coherent and crescendos at the gateway reveal, but the felt price of pushing through is underplayed—no foreclosed option or visible loss beyond effort. The external and internal threads align, though the conflict resolves smoothly. One strong deepening beat suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—whether and how to share/receive magnetized stories—tightens slightly when the woman reveals her loss. Escalation is modest; the primary turn is disclosure, followed by gentle counsel. Costs remain abstract, with no option truly foreclosed on the page. The cadence shift at the end deepens purpose but doesn’t bite.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—understanding/repair—tightens as the sextant yields fragments and the labyrinth “responds.” Escalation is present but gentle; there’s little opposition or trade-off, so tension stays textural rather than urgent. The decisive act (deconstruction and reassembly) earns resolution, but the price is conceptual, not felt as a loss. The result is satisfying but low-pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (revive a dying realm) are signaled early and deepen as the last thread eludes her, forcing a tactic shift from lexical recall to embodied feeling. The escalation is gentle; external resistance is minimal and largely internal. Closure is earned by her agency (singing), but there’s little visible price or foreclosed alternative on the page. Tension is steady rather than tightening to a sharp pinch.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes remain internal (self-concealment vs. acceptance), and pressure deepens only slightly with the blank book’s ethos. There’s a meaningful turn—the decision to stop hiding—but little visible price or narrowed option set. The dialogue and chamber scene don’t escalate conflict so much as affirm theme. Tension is gentle rather than tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.2)
    Pressure is gentle: the discovery of the plaque is the lone meaningful deepening. Stakes remain internal and low‑heat; no option is truly foreclosed, and risk is minimal. The cadence shift at the plaque works under a textural lens but escalation is modest. The ending’s peace feels earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure escalates from curiosity to destabilization to mission, but stakes stay largely abstract (“illusions fading”). The tremor and device spike are good pressure points; the narrowing of options is implied rather than forced. Little visible loss or trade‑off on the page. The ending’s agency is a stance rather than a sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.0)
    Stakes are articulated early (maintain the hush, retrieve truth), and there’s one clear tightening with the men and the matching charm. Yet pressure disperses: the confrontation resolves via assertion more than risk, and no option is visibly foreclosed. The sunrise clock doesn’t materially force tactics, and the “thwarting” happens off-page. Cost remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are signaled (identity, selection, weather‑bearing) and the midpoint tightening arrives with the shadowed figure’s revelation. However, pressure is low: obstacles do not materially resist her, and the election clock is not felt as a live constraint. The acceptance is earned but largely uncontested, with minimal price on the page. Escalation reads as an information deepening more than a squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain a “mechanical” portraitist or risk self—emerges early and tightens when the hidden self‑portrait/note reframes her fear. The escalation is modest but coherent under the accumulative lens, with the discover → act progression reweighting the cost. The opposition is internal only, so the turn feels slightly easy; nonetheless the renunciation is clear. The lock’s final placement underscores the price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early, and pressure coheres as she follows clues and confronts the chamber’s truths. However, escalation is soft: obstacles are minimal, opposition is mostly atmospheric, and the key turn arrives without resistance. The price paid is mainly conceptual; no significant option is foreclosed beyond a worldview shift. The trickle of water reads as a fast payoff, diminishing the felt risk.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.6)
    Pressure is largely aesthetic: glistening intensifies, motion initiates, bells respond, sun breaks—an emotional deepening rather than narrowing options. Stakes are declared (preserving wonder) but seldom tested or forced into a trade‑off. The one tightening beat is the moment she commits and sets the sculpture in motion. Cost remains abstract, limiting escalation impact.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and escalates when fears physically wriggle out, forcing a decisive tactic (miniaturize). The tightening is clear—open box closes options, resistance mounts, cost accrues—but reversal is mostly told rather than dramatized beat by beat. Consequences are lasting and character‑driven, though the struggle lacks a concrete on‑page setback that narrows choices further.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (unlock the past; validate listening) are legible, and escalation moves from curiosity to commitment (using the key) to revelation. Pressure remains gentle—no significant trade-off or felt loss—and coincidence (the key-in-locket fit) eases the path. The read-aloud functions as a culminating act but with little risk. Effective but not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes (liberate buried knowledge) are signaled, but pressure remains low and largely uncontested. The key escalation—the dance unlocking the lab—arrives without credible risk, loss, or trade‑off. Options don’t narrow so much as reveal themselves on cue, undercutting tension. The final beat is satisfying conceptually but not stress‑tested.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes (recovering erased memories) are clear, and pressure accumulates through ritual preparation to the threshold crossing. However, the path is unopposed; no credible loss, trade-off, or foreclosed option emerges during the peak. The “tightening” beat exists (air shifts → doorway), but cost is minimal. The resolution is earned but low-friction.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is early and coherent: hush the dangerous prophecy. Pressure escalates via resistance (“coded words thrashing”) and the wing’s rising hum to a final surge. The cost is soft—no foreclosed personal path or concrete sacrifice beyond fatigue and future vigilance—so the tightening lacks a felt price. Still, agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (will Clara engage and begin listening/acting) is legible, but pressure rises mainly through talk rather than concrete costs. The meaningful tightening is Elias reframing the seal as a key and handing over sugar, which narrows her options. Consequence remains conceptual; the social/emotional price is understated. Effective, but low‑temperature escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—whether to accept translating/archiving the quarantined memories—tightens as the hum intensifies and the figure presents a choice. The escalation is internal but coherent: feeling-flood → vision encounter → assent, with a cadence shift when she actively weaves the memories. Costs are implied rather than tested, keeping pressure more lyrical than dire. Still, the acceptance is protagonist-driven and resolves the presented tension.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (whether to erase and forgive) is signaled early and tightened at the moment of contact. The reversal is internal but decisive; hesitation yields to action, with the cost of obliterating a primary document of harm. Pressure is coherent, though escalation is single‑step and gently modulated. A sharper trade‑off beyond symbolism could have heightened consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (grasp the nature of echoes) is clear, with one meaningful deepening at the pool. Pressure grows coherently but gently; no hard trade-off or foreclosed option is dramatized. The figure’s test (“ensure you are ready”) feels passable rather than exacting, softening the sense of price. Tension is present but remains more contemplative than coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the globe’s truth—tightens via the serial dreams and culminates in the whispered names and charged placement. Pressure escalates in texture rather than direct opposition; there’s little active risk or counterforce. The candle gutter/dawn clock is a mild narrowing. The resolution is earned but the on‑page price remains gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (to perceive and honor hidden effort/patterns) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens. The whistle echo is a gentle deepening, not a foreclosing turn or price‑exacting test. No option is materially narrowed; resolution reads as acceptance more than a choice under pressure. The ending’s peace feels earned emotionally but light on dramatized cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (preserve life vs. contain a dangerous stillpoint) is clear and tightens as shadows coalesce and the diamond’s flaw widens. The escalation is protagonist-driven (choosing containment over destruction) and the time pressure is legible. Cost is concrete—exhaustion, reintroduction of storms, ongoing vigilance—so the final image carries charge. No extraneous reversals; one meaningful deepening sustains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are declared (old order vs new dawn), and pressure tightens toward the activation, but the choice reads easy—little on-page resistance or tradeoff beyond rhetoric. The command “Unfold it” quickly resolves the dilemma, minimizing ambiguity. Global stakes remain abstract while local stakes are thin. The escalation is coherent yet lacks a felt price that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—coaxing and preserving a fugitive music—tightens when the box resists, then flips by playing on its own, forcing Elias to surrender control. The dropped jar is a visible price and alters his tactic (from capturing to receiving). Pressure escalates coherently under the accumulative lens, though it remains gentle rather than harrowing. The resolution grows from his altered stance, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is early and clear: protect the key. Escalation coheres from ambient vibration to an embodied antagonist and a vision-based feint, forcing a choice. The primary tightening is the reveal that the figure is harmful; Elara’s counter is decisive but low-cost. The world-scale stakes declared by the intruder outstrip on-page consequence, sapping peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes remain internal and abstract; pressure is steady but soft, with little narrowing of options. The primary tightening is the ascent and realization on the viaduct, reframing connection and pace. There’s minimal felt price or irreversible trade‑off on the page. Escalation reads as density rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are legible (truth vs. corruption; autonomy vs. mentor’s control) and escalation is a steady deepening of knowledge. Agency drives turns (prying, decoding, opening), but overt resistance or jeopardy is minimal, and no option closes with a concrete price in-scene. The incriminating photo tightens the noose conceptually but pressure never bites physically or morally in the moment. Effective but safe.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake—whether Elias will act on Thomas’s claim—tightens through the examination and repair culminating in the heart’s renewed ticking. Pressure accrues via Alistair’s subtext and the symbolic success of the repair, which forecloses continued passivity. The moral calculus (“Did he deserve this?”) crystallizes. The price is implied resolve rather than a concrete sacrifice on the page, tempering intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (unlock the yearning algorithm/ring the unheard bell) is signaled early and culminates in a decisive act. Escalation is mostly discovery pace—weeks of work to motif to manifestation—without a real foreclosed option or real risk. The world’s response implies scale, but personal cost or tradeoff at the climax is faint. Pressure reads coherent but gentle under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. corporate purge/erasure) is signaled early and tightens with the lockout turn. The lie and the offline bypass are meaningful escalations driven by agency. The price remains largely implied; no concrete loss is paid on the page, tempering impact. Tension builds coherently to a stance‑crystallizing ending.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring balance/empathy via the crystal—is signaled early, but pressure escalates gently rather than coercively. The key turn (placing the fragment at the pedestal) leads to an effortless resolution as other shards assemble themselves, undercutting cost. Internal and external threads interweave, yet the conflict never forces a consequential trade‑off. The final act reads earned but easy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—can she locate and name the approach of endings—tightens when the survivor asks, “What does it sound like?” The pressure is largely internal and accumulative rather than overtly escalatory, but the question acts as a hinge beat. Resolution is a stance crystallization rather than a trade‑off with visible loss. Stakes remain quiet and mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are internal—how to understand love and mismatch—and are signaled early. Escalation is modest: noticing the vines’ symmetry deepens the dilemma and sets up the shift. The price paid (relinquishing the ideal of perfect alignment) is present but largely conceptual. No single high‑pressure turn or external test limits the ceiling here.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve the echo before the prophet’s shift) is clear, but pressure scarcely tightens; the ritual proceeds without obstacle or trade‑off. The prophet’s arrival functions more as benediction than test. There’s no reversal or narrowing of options beyond a gentle cadence increase when the parapet responds. The price paid is largely conceptual, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting collective pain—remains clear but largely untested by opposing force. The only tightening is a cadence shift toward dusk rather than a choice that forecloses an option. There’s minimal on‑page cost or reversal; the work proceeds without complication. Tension stays gentle and textural rather than escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (decode to revive language) is clear, with one meaningful tightening when the crystal begins to drain. The price is legible and alters options: knowledge gained equals tool depletion. Pressure is mostly internal and textural; there’s no strong reversal or forced trade-off beyond endurance. The resolution is earned but quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible and concentrates: the search tightens via thicker fog, found driftwood, and the unintended circle. Escalation is textural rather than adversarial but results in a felt narrowing of options (from mapping to listening). Cost is present yet soft—more explicit foreclosing of an alternative path would deepen pressure. Still, the final renunciation reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (holding the ephemeral without freezing it) is clear and coheres. Escalation is a single deepening: from malfunction to metaphoric understanding to structural redesign of the device. The price paid is primarily conceptual and vocational (abandon “repair” for “reimagine”) rather than a hard trade‑off, keeping the pressure gentle. Still, the shift narrows options credibly under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are singular and clear (reunite before death), but escalation is gentle; obstacles fold quickly once Elara acts. The tightening turn (the call leading to Claire’s arrival and the bedside moment) happens, yet costs and trade‑offs remain lightly sketched. The emotional price (lost time, impending loss) is implied rather than dramatized under duress. No substantive reversal tests Elara’s commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (managing an awakening to answer the noon‑shadow mystery) is signaled early, but escalation is gentle. The primary tightening is the timed noon window; no genuine reversal tests her commitment. Resolution stems from agency (activating the key), yet the price paid is minimal. Pressure coheres without biting.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (mend what’s broken through uncertain means) is clear and tightens at the ask for a “piece of your certainty,” forcing a trade‑off. The escalation is mostly internal, but the ritual’s rule provides concrete pressure and a non‑reversible choice. The maze traversal lacks on‑page complications, keeping external pressure modest. The final decision is protagonist‑driven and carries a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is clear but pressure escalates gently; the tightening arrives via thickening mist → moonlight reveal rather than hard trade‑offs. Agency centers on endurance and craft, with no option truly foreclosed. The final decision to return to the village registers, though with limited felt cost. Tension remains lyric rather than coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: whether Elara will risk letting someone into her protected space. Escalation occurs via Kai’s acknowledgment of the confession and the offered notebook, which narrows her options from deflecting to engaging. The price is emotional exposure, but tension stays low and largely harmonious. No hard reversal; a single deepening carries the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—will she shoulder the stories and commit to solemnizing them—tightens as the whispers intensify and the shell becomes a key. The path reveal and the woman’s cameo serve as the meaningful pressure points. The price paid is internal and muted; no overt trade‑off or loss is staged beyond burden acceptance. Escalation remains coherent under the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear (restore practices to heal the village), but antagonistic pressure is minimal and the outcome faces little resistance. The single tightening beat—alignment with the harvest moon—works, yet no option is truly foreclosed or traded. The “price” of future labor doesn’t register as a cost in-scene. Tension remains gentle rather than testing commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is legible (completing the sealing), with a single tightening via the tremor and nearing climax. Pressure remains gentle; there’s little opposition or trade‑off beyond expending the vial. The ending is earned but the felt price and narrowing of options are modest. Tension is mostly atmospheric rather than consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (repair the timer to harvest echoes) is signaled early, and the dusk alignment creates a meaningful tightening. Yet resistance is minimal and external pressure thin; success arrives without a visible sacrifice or reversal beyond patience. Tension is mostly conceptual and atmospheric rather than adversarial. The resolution is earned but low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—remain the burden-bearer or redirect toward self—tightens through the figure’s questioning and the offered hand. The escalation is a controlled deepening rather than a reversal, congruent with the chosen lens. The choice forecloses a path in principle but the price is underplayed on the page. Tension is steady and sentence-level pressure aligns with the turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (can she make meaning without being consumed by grief) are signaled early and deepen at the mane problem, a concrete tightening. Her renewed focus after reflection and tea feels like an earned adaptation. The price is quiet endurance rather than a sharp trade‑off; effective but modest in intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure coheres through the wheel’s escalating guidance and the voice’s clarity; the dominant stake is internal and steady. One meaningful tightening occurs when the voice reframes the “ghost” as guide. Still, escalation remains gentle and largely tonal, with limited visible cost or narrowed options. The result is satisfying but low‑temperature.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on animating a dead place to test a personal thesis of hope; escalation is a gentle density increase rather than a squeeze. His methodical tinkering accumulates to a terminal‑wide “exhibit,” but opposition is minimal and choices don’t foreclose significant options. The felt price—accepting the terminal’s permanent closure—is poignant yet low‑temperature. A single complicating setback would have sharpened cost.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (duty vs. abandoned dream) are signaled early and deepen when the crystals crystallize pressure into “bear,” prompting a concrete act. The completion of the clock narrows options through acceptance rather than departure, which reads as a trade-off. Escalation is coherent but low-voltage; there’s no secondary pressure testing the choice beyond interior resolve. The price is felt but subtle.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (uncovering truth) is signaled early, but pressure barely tightens; the chest appears without real friction. The meaningful deepening arrives with the confession and the sundial’s glow, yet no option is truly foreclosed. Consequences are promised rather than felt, leaving tension underpowered. The scene resolves without a credible on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes (preserving ancient methods) are declared early, but pressure remains gentle and mostly textural. The one tightening beat is the unusual “spiral within a spiral” knot and the glass’s alignment, which deepens knowledge rather than narrowing options. There’s little visible price or foreclosed path on the page. Resolution arrives without a meaningful test or trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes focus on whether presence and language can reconfigure grief. Escalation is a soft deepening: confession, composition, reading, and the exchange of threads. The cost is emotional release rather than a foreclosed option, which keeps pressure modest. Still, the turning point—memorializing the self who waited—credibly narrows the woman’s future stance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres: finding the egg, confronting the machine, and choosing to assemble tighten options. The key turn is assembly leading to the hologram and the price-aware message. Stakes skew abstract; on-page risk remains low and largely internal, which keeps the escalation modest. The ending’s renunciation is earned but not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are focused (can damaged ground hold new life; can she reframe her legacy) and the tightening arrives via the storm’s crest and the irrevocable burial of coin and seeds. Escalation is quiet and internal, with cost framed as possible failure and continued social burden. While effective, the pressure never quite corners her into a trade‑off beyond the ritual act. Tension is steady rather than climbing in sharp steps.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes cohere—liberate memories/restore the city—but escalation is more patterned intensification than pressure: each breadcrumb advances without genuine resistance. The mirror moment is the strongest tightening, confronting her with a younger self, yet it doesn’t force a hard trade‑off. Resolution arrives through completion rather than contested choice. Cost remains conceptual rather than felt in the body or circumstances.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Pressure accrues via intensification rather than conflict: pings strengthen, light spills, gear reconfigures. The dominant stake is clear, but opposition is minimal and no option is truly foreclosed on the page. The tightening is present yet gentle, with a soft price paid. Effective but not gripping.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure is primarily internal and coheres around a single stake: how to render grief. The meaningful tightening occurs when the ribbon’s pattern reframes the task, compelling a new tactic (etching migration). Cost is subtle but legible (accepting an unfinishable process, mentor fading). Escalation is quiet yet sufficient under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes—restoring balance—remain mostly internal and communal, with limited external pressure or reversals. The meaningful tightening is Elias deciding to act beyond winding, but resistance is minimal. The pause moment crystallizes intent rather than testing it. Escalation is gentle and largely narrated in retrospect.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding to understand intention—is pursued steadily but faces scant resistance or trade‑offs. The main tightening is the shift from curiosity to recognition of enduring love, which is meaningful but low‑pressure. Time’s passage (chess clock stopping, hours working) creates texture rather than tension. No option is foreclosed on the page, so the felt price remains minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled (revive a stagnant kingdom), but the on‑page pressure is mild; the quill’s near-effortless cooperation reduces friction. The meaningful tightening is the choice to abandon strict logic and trust the quill, yet no option is foreclosed with visible cost. Escalation reads as quickening lyric density rather than narrowed options. Ending earns hope, not consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (recovering lost stories) is legible and the broadcast deepens pressure with a cadence shift when the glow spreads and the song slows. Escalation is coherent but quiet; risk and price are implied rather than dramatized. The abrupt end to the song acts as a tightening beat. Consequences beyond resolve are deferred.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are primarily internal—honoring the dead and accepting impermanence—and escalate through density rather than turns. The clearest tightening is the slowing chair and the moment she releases ash, but opposition is soft. The cost (letting go and sealing a promise) is legible yet not sharply contested. Pressure holds but could benefit from one bolder on‑page tradeoff or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving artifacts versus moving toward rebuilding—is legible early. The collapse adds real pressure and prompts action, but costs and reversals remain relatively gentle. Agency drives the turn (he chooses to leave and salvage). Tension exists at beat and story scales, though it never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (preserving vanishing arts vs. indifference) are clear, but pressure remains gentle, with little real risk or loss. The escalation is a deepening of method rather than a narrowing of options. The performance provides a cadence shift, yet costs and consequences are largely implied. No decisive reversal tests commitment under strain.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (grow the fruit to spark a “gentle rebellion”) and escalate through the alignment peak, sprouting, doubt, and the decisive pruning. The pruning choice functions as the tightening beat that reorients both the space and her stance. However, the price remains largely symbolic and risk‑light, limiting tension. The resolution is earned but not hard‑won.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (uncover/communicate the truth) is clear, but pressure is low: the path opens easily, with no opposing force or credible risk. The descent and orb touch are escalations, yet they lack a trade‑off beyond awe and comprehension. The ending stance crystallizes but doesn’t visibly foreclose a path or exact a price in scene. Tension is present, not taut.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes are intimate and primarily conceptual (can he learn to read why houses feel alive), with one tightening when he arranges the objects and speaks. Pressure remains gentle; the ritual succeeds without a visible trade-off or narrowed options. The glow moment deepens knowledge but doesn’t force a choice with cost beyond tacit responsibility. Tension is felt as hush rather than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (save the village) is clear; the key tightening is Liora’s warning that reframes Elara’s path. The price—hesitation and added testing under time pressure—is present but mostly implied and off‑page. Escalation is modest and resolves without on‑page resistance beyond caution. Still, agency meaningfully alters the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (can she move toward “perpetual motion” without clinging to the past) is clear, and escalation crystallizes when the chipped die tumbles away, narrowing options. The choice to proceed with one die is an earned renunciation with legible cost. Internal and external pressures interweave without contrivance. Stakes remain intimate but consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure accrues through intensification—brush hum, vision, greenhouse shift—and narrows to completing the painting. However, the stakes remain largely conceptual; there’s little on-page price or foreclosed option beyond fatigue and a vowed purpose. The tightening is real but gentle under the accumulative lens. Agency is present (she keeps painting) but faces limited resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (reviving a dying tradition) are identified early and the public sharing creates a gentle test. The tightening beat is Elara’s move from private experiment to communal ritual, but resistance is minimal and success arrives smoothly. The lens’s approval chime and the crowd’s immediate warmth reduce friction. Cost remains soft, keeping escalation modest.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear early and the pressure coheres around activating the stone. Escalation tightens through glow → structural shudder → blinding flash → transformed mechanism. The price is felt but not deeply tested on-page; resistance is atmospheric rather than forcing a hard trade‑off. Still, agency drives the turn and forecloses “going back.”

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—confronting fear—tightens via the paradox/dictionary tactic and culminates in the unbosoming that forecloses avoidance. Escalation is primarily density and image-driven, fitting the lens, with one meaningful cadence shift at the climax. The cost is felt but relatively gentle; the advisor’s assistance removes some friction. Still, the shift credibly stems from Clara’s agency at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on transforming dissonance into harmony; escalation arrives as the clouds’ responsive complexity and the deliberate intensification of notes. However, no option is plausibly foreclosed; failure or cost is never materially at risk. The tightening is real (music as map, culminating pattern) but remains soft-pressure rather than a true trade‑off. Resolution is earned but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (breach the boundary to learn why it sealed), and one meaningful tightening occurs (the crack reroutes the quest inward). However, opposition is soft—the watchers do not resist, and problems resolve without a taxing adaptation. The stakes expand convincingly, but escalation reads more as uncovering than enduring pressure with a price.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are coherent—recover the truth—and the riddle/key/basement sequence supplies a single tightening. Escalation remains gentle; there’s little risk, opposition, or material cost, so tension is more quest‑procedural than pressurized. The final stance is earned but not hard‑won. A credible obstacle or tradeoff would have deepened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are coherent (recovering and honoring drowned dreams), and the journal discovery is the key tightening that deepens resolve. Pressure remains mostly internal and textural; there’s little active resistance beyond environment and time. The glowing mosaic reweights rather than resolves a conflict, appropriate to the lens but keeps the cost soft. Still, escalation reads cleanly as density and commitment increasing.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (uncover the city’s origins) is signaled early, and the tightening comes with the map alignment and stamp activation. Escalation is largely informative rather than adversarial; the “clock” of the waning blackout appears late and softly. Choices are present but carry little visible price, and no option is meaningfully foreclosed. The resolution is earned, but the pressure never bites.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (how to live with grief) is signaled early and tightens when Lira challenges his coping tactic. The meaningful turn occurs at the altar with the reframe of the shadow; he pays a price by relinquishing the protective numbness. No antagonist needed; pressure holds and deepens to a credible choice.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes are dominantly internal (reclaiming purpose), signaled early and tightened by the observatory’s silence and the geode realization. Escalation reads as a density increase rather than reversals; the key deepening is shifting focus from external beauty to interior potential. The cost is present but soft; no concrete loss or foreclosed external path tests her stance. Still, the final stance crystallization (“seeker, a hunter of light”) is earned within this length.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract and largely unopposed; discovery proceeds without resistance or sacrifice. The one tightening—locational escalation from chamber to tower to vault—adds scope but not cost. The assembly moment solves cleanly without a complicating reversal. Tension is steady but subdued.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around an internal moral stake that tightens decisively at the watch‑hand/clock alignment. The loss of the watch and the acceptance he cannot undo the lie provide visible cost and an earned narrowing of options. While external pressures are minimal, the internal escalation is clear and sufficient at this length. Slightly contained scope holds it below the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—whether to exit the blame cycle—arrives early, and the tightening occurs when Kael challenges neutrality and Elara reframes it, leading to his conditional assent. The price is acknowledged (“I do not forgive lightly”) but not strongly dramatized; no option is visibly foreclosed on the page. Pressure remains coherent yet gentle, more ethical redefinition than hard trade‑off. Stakes feel real but land as a calibrated détente rather than a costly pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (can she move forward without false certainties?) is clear; pressure coheres through the approach, push‑off, distance from poles, and stowing the compass. Escalation is subtle rather than sharp; one meaningful tightening occurs as she chooses adaptation over perfection. The price—letting a defining identity/tool go—is felt but not punishing. No external counterpressure limits peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are internal (erase vs. understand; empathy as burden), and pressure coheres once the ball sinks, forcing a charged pursuit into the lake. The deepening via symbols and intensified glow reweights the choice, culminating in a renunciation (letting the ball go, rejecting the old self). The price is legible though understated. Lack of external counterforce keeps tension modest but aligned with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake is clear, and pressure rises from omen to guardian challenge to conjuration. However, escalation lacks a tangible price or narrowed options; the guardian’s warning doesn’t force a hard trade‑off. The turn arrives but tests commitment lightly. Resolution feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—atoning for missed time—and tightens at the activation of the saucer and the card draws. The symbolic shedding of the cloak marks a decisive narrowing of stance. Cost is primarily internal, but it’s felt and not waved away. A touch more friction or a tested trade‑off on the page could have heightened escalation further.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.4)
    Stakes are declared as species-level, but on-page pressure remains gentle; no real obstacle resists Elara’s plan. The shift from approach to stitching is a deepening, not a tightening that forecloses options with price. The resolution follows her intent without reversal or credible risk. The result is moving but low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: abandoning the intended climb for the hush-led detour tightens options, and releasing the bottle imposes a clear price. The decisive action arises from Elara’s agency rather than coincidence resolving the conflict. Stakes remain internal/spiritual yet feel tangible at the peak. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (awakening the populace without bloodshed) is clear, and pressure tightens with the approaching footsteps and Thorne’s challenge. However, the confrontation resolves with minimal resistance—his hesitation grants her a clear lane. No meaningful price is paid on the page; her action has little immediate backlash. Tension exists but doesn’t escalate into a true test of commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding the patterns) is signaled early and tightens through the stilling air and synchronized eels to the decisive act of scattering dust. Escalation is primarily atmospheric/density‑based, fitting the chosen lens. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, which limits punch; the outcome skews affirmative with limited visible loss beyond spent dust and prior trade. Still, the ritual compels an irreversible step that narrows options and reweights knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (whether to confront the past/self and write without censorship) is signaled early and tightens via the envelope reveal and the timer’s countdown. The key turn is clear at the timer’s last click; escalation remains primarily internal and modest. The cost of the choice is gestured at (return to scars) rather than felt in a concrete loss. Pressure is coherent but never truly cornering.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    Pressure coheres through the duel of interpretations; the tightening occurs when Elias reframes angles from map to process and pushes Mara into hesitation. Stakes remain largely conceptual, and the price of the outcome is understated. Still, agency drives the turn, and the sundial method keeps the pressure legible. No soft reset or coincidence undercuts the result.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—can beauty and refuge be built from decay?—is signaled early and deepens via the grandfather’s letters and the library’s revival. The meaningful tightening comes when Elias opts for a more permanent self and publicly commits to the work (poems on walls). Costs and losses remain abstract; no option is visibly foreclosed beyond implication. Tension is steady but low.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early, and the key tightening is Elara’s decision to pursue the reel, escalating into entering it. Pressure remains mostly internal; the external search resolves without substantial friction. The price lands as renunciation of magical fixes in favor of acceptance, which narrows her future path. Stakes could feel sharper with one concrete obstacle or trade‑off on the search beat.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (protect memory before monsoon), but pressure barely tightens: the single gatekeeping question is answered without struggle, and no option is foreclosed. The time clock motivates but never corners her into a hard choice. Resolution rests on compliance rather than sacrifice or loss. Tension is present yet gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (release vs. holding regret) tightens through one clear deepening: the compass settles and forces a trek that culminates in reading and letting the sea take the letters. The cost is understated but present—he forfeits relics and accepts dissolution. Pressure remains coherent under the accumulative lens without contrivance. A slightly higher band would need a sharper on-page test or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict is Elara's internal quest for meaning, with the decaying greenhouse as the external pressure point. The stakes are personal and philosophical. The narrative deepens effectively as her experiments yield increasingly profound results, culminating in the creation of the butterfly. This final beat provides a clear resolution to her internal state, with the cost being the acceptance of her past losses.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stakes escalate effectively, shifting from an internal search for purpose to the external, high-stakes goal of rescuing a captive apprentice. This tightening occurs on the page with the discovery of the final ledger, a clear turning point driven by the protagonist's agency. The cost is legible in the loss of her former life and the acceptance of a dangerous new mission.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in a soundless world—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal and existential, which is handled well. Kael's arrival provides a meaningful deepening of the central problem, shifting the pressure from solitary struggle to collaborative discovery. The resolution is earned through a shift in perspective, and the cost—abandoning the old definition of music—is palpable in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—giving the city's souls a voice—is signaled well and pursued with clear agency. The plot tightens effectively from a vague quest to a specific, difficult task. However, the central struggle of finding the fragments is somewhat compressed; the process is described more than it is dramatized, slightly softening the tension that could have been generated by showing failure or greater difficulty in overcoming specific obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—the community's future under sanctions—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict tightens effectively when Mara's anonymity is compromised, forcing her to escalate her strategy from covert aid to overt leadership. This turn is driven by her agency and carries the clear cost of public responsibility, making the final resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—finding where unused love is stored—is established early and provides a clear throughline. The conflict escalates through a series of discoveries rather than through opposition, which works for the story's contemplative tone but lacks high tension. The resolution is earned within the story's internal logic, but the absence of any real obstacle or setback makes the journey's pressure feel more atmospheric than actively challenging.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding time and restoring lost memories—is signaled early. However, the pressure remains largely atmospheric rather than materializing into a significant obstacle. The maze's "hyperbolic geometry" is described but doesn't force Elara to adapt her tactics or make a difficult trade-off. The conflict resolves without a compelling struggle, weakening the sense that the final reward was truly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake and escalates pressure effectively under a Causal lens. The twin threats—the collapsing wall (a time limit) and the arriving enemies (direct opposition)—create a coherent and tightening conflict. The protagonist's agency is demonstrated in their choice to use stealth over confrontation, a decision forced by the constraint of their chains, which makes the subsequent chase feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a powerful, internal stake and escalates pressure effectively under its Accumulative lens. The climactic act of using the forge is a decisive intensification driven by protagonist agency. The cost is made visceral and unmistakable on the page ("a resonant ache that echoed through her entire being"), perfectly validating the emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: Lira’s quest for a path, symbolized by the jar. The conflict meaningfully tightens with the discovery of the floral trap, which raises the immediate stakes from a simple heist to a coded test. The resolution is driven by Lira’s agency in accepting the jar's true nature, and the cost is legible in her transformation from thief to seeker.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal conflict is well-defined—control versus vulnerability—and the stakes are personal and clear. The story achieves a single, meaningful deepening of this conflict as Elara works, culminating in her act of “abandon.” The pressure is entirely internal, which is appropriate for the lens, but the resolution feels more like an intellectual acceptance than a choice forced by escalating pressure, slightly diminishing the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming her identity—is established early and pursued consistently. The decryption of the notes and the discovery of the key serve as a meaningful tightening of pressure, narrowing her options toward a single path. However, the antagonistic force is entirely abstract ("whoever had kept her in the dark"), which keeps the external pressure from feeling immediate or adaptive, slightly muting the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central conflict—an attempt to map an abstract concept—is expertly handled through textural escalation. Pressure deepens with each story, the hush becomes palpable, and the final star’s disappearance provides a powerful tightening. The stake, achieving their life's work, is re-consecrated in the final beat with the felt cost of its eternal, ongoing nature.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.7)
    The central stake—understanding the origin of thought—is clear and personal. Playing the violin serves as the meaningful deepening point, committing the protagonist to the process. The resolution provides a clear "after" state with a legible conceptual cost. The escalation, however, is very rapid and internal, feeling more like a compressed summary of a conflict than a moment-to-moment struggle with rising pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—mending a frayed relationship—is signaled early and the pressure deepens internally, culminating in Elara’s risky choice to act. This demonstrates agency. The primary weakness is the climax, where the external conflict dissolves without any tangible struggle; the resolution is immediate and frictionless, which lessens the feeling of earnedness and high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—finding meaning in a life of imperfect efforts—is signaled clearly and deepens through the central ritual. Under an accumulative lens, the daily act of polishing and placing the marbles serves as a meaningful intensification of pressure, leading to the final stance crystallization. The cost, an acceptance of his life's flaws and mortality, is legible in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story signals a clear dominant stake (proving the theory) and executes one meaningful, high-cost escalation driven by the protagonist's agency. The pressure builds logically from calibration to potential overload, and the resolution comes from a deliberate choice, not luck. The cost—a new and dangerous responsibility—is made explicit and charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—to break the silence—and escalates the pressure effectively through a single, potent deepening when the ghost appears. Clara’s agency in humming the melody drives the resolution, and the cost of the program dissolving provides a tangible price for the final peace, making the climax feel earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear, potent internal stake—the need to reconcile a "swallowed truth"—from the outset. The pressure deepens effectively under an accumulative lens, intensified first by the smudged ink and then by the wanderer's philosophical challenge. The final resolution is driven by Elara's agency, and the cost of her new perspective is rendered with unmistakable clarity on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story signals a clear internal stake and builds pressure through discovery and supernatural escalation. However, the climax falters as the antagonistic force—the lunging shadows—presents no meaningful resistance. The conflict is resolved by a single, unopposed action, which deflates the tension and makes the protagonist's victory feel perfunctory and without a palpable price.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s internal struggle with the nature of change and preservation—is signaled early and effectively deepened. The journey to the refuge provides a clear escalation of physical action, which culminates in the high-stakes psychological test at the mirror. The resolution lands with a legible cost: her previous understanding is shattered and replaced by a more profound, but less comforting, wisdom.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Finn’s fear can be transformed into wonder—is established early and resolved. The pressure escalates appropriately for the short form as the sky darkens. The climax, a shared quiet moment, provides a meaningful deepening of the emotional state. However, the conflict is resolved with a gentle smoothness that lacks a truly sharp or costly trade-off, keeping it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes enormous stakes—restoring dreams to all humanity—but the on-page conflict is merely an intellectual puzzle without meaningful opposition or setbacks. The pressure never truly escalates; each step is a discovery that simplifies the problem. The resolution lacks a tangible cost for the protagonist, which significantly undermines the weight of her achievement and the scale of the initial stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—Li Wei's self-actualization—is clear, but the conflict is almost entirely internal and reflective. Pressure doesn't escalate through external events or narrowing options, but rather through a slow-burning, summarized desire. The key turning point is an unearned epiphany, which changes knowledge but feels more like a gift than a choice made under duress. The cost of the final decision is abstract and future-oriented, lacking immediate, on-page consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is clear and the pressure escalates effectively, culminating in a final choice driven by the protagonist's agency. The tightening is well-placed, with the question "What if the possession is not a threat but a mirror?" creating a palpable shift that weakens the antagonist's hold. The cost—a permanent alteration of the anchor's foundational reality—is legible and gives the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—completing the symphony before exhaustion—is signaled early and provides clear narrative thrust. The pressure escalates effectively with the arrival of dawn, forcing the character to act and narrowing their options to a single, final choice. The cost of this choice is made explicit and visible on the page when the writer collapses, providing a satisfying, earned resolution to the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—conquering the self—and attempts escalation by showing darker versions of the protagonist and a dimming resource (the tablet). However, the conflict resolves through passive realization rather than a climactic, agent-driven choice. The stakes deflate into a painless epiphany, with the final cost being illegible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—overcoming numbness—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict escalates through the protagonist's own agency as she commits to the difficult process of reversing the songs. The resolution is earned, and the cost is legible in the "raw, aching" feeling that replaces the numbness, creating a meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—understanding the message—and escalates it effectively into a much larger threat. The confrontation with the masked figure provides a meaningful tightening of the conflict, raising the stakes from personal curiosity to a widespread danger. However, the external pressure feels inconsistent; the threat of armed guards is introduced but never materializes into a tangible obstacle, slightly weakening the build-up of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant internal stake—whether Elias will confront his suppressed grief—is established early and remains the central focus. The pressure deepens effectively when he feels the "inexplicable pull" of the vial, forcing a choice that forecloses his path of avoidance. The protagonist's agency is clear in the final moments, as he actively chooses to uncork the vial, paying the emotional cost to achieve resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept internal stake—to understand time—and escalates the pressure by deepening the philosophical complexity with each new layer of pattern. The climax at the mirror presents a potent, crystallized choice between three distinct modes of being. The resolution, a stance crystallization rather than a simple victory, is earned through protagonist agency and carries the legible cost of abandoning the search for a singular truth.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant internal stake—whether Elara can create meaning from devastating silence—is established early and compellingly. The pressure escalates texturally, with the discovery of the mendicant's bowl serving as the pivotal deepening moment that changes her tactics from passive observation to active creation. The cost is visible in her final acceptance of imperfection, a renunciation of the desire for a world made whole again, which powerfully resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—maintaining professional integrity while engaging with profound emotion—is clear and compelling. Pressure deepens effectively when Elara realizes the full truth behind her client's request, raising the stakes of her craft. The final cost, a "faint ache," is legible on the page and perfectly scaled to the story’s quiet intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The stakes are purely internal and emotional—a desire for connection—and the conflict lacks significant opposition. While Elara takes the risk of meeting in person, the pressure remains low throughout. The resolution is a positive affirmation rather than a choice made with a visible or deeply felt cost, which limits the story's overall tension and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s need for belonging—is established immediately and remains the clear focus. The conflict escalates effectively when she finds the tag, giving her an active quest. The resolution is earned through her own agency as her search method inadvertently builds the connections she desires, with the cost being months of dedicated, vulnerable effort.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—Mara’s creative block—is established well, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation driven by her agency. Pressure intensifies via external magic, not through her choices narrowing options or facing significant opposition. The resolution is achieved by arriving at a destination, not by overcoming a tangible obstacle with a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—understanding ambiguous loss—and effectively escalates it. The discovery of the mentor's journal provides a meaningful tightening, transforming an intellectual puzzle into a perilous quest. Elara's subsequent choice to proceed despite the warning demonstrates agency, and the cost (the risk of unraveling emotion itself) is made explicit, charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—risking sanctuary for visibility—is established early and tested throughout. The conflict is primarily internal, and it deepens effectively when the character finds the cache, which forces them to commit to their motivation. The resolution is earned through the protagonist’s direct agency, and the cost (loss of safety) is clear and present from beginning to end.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant internal stake—control versus surrender—is signaled early and escalated effectively under the Accumulative lens, with the intensifying storm mirroring Mara’s cracking resolve. Her final choice to rearrange the nursery is a clear act of agency. The cost of this choice, the embrace of terrifying uncertainty, is made explicit and gives the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—Elara's internal search for meaning—and escalates it effectively from passive restlessness to an active quest. The climax, the "exchange," provides a decisive tightening driven by protagonist agency. The cost is legible as she trades her old identity for a new one, making the resolution feel earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: Elara’s crisis of faith in her clairvoyance. Pressure deepens effectively when she touches the pearl and loses agency, being pulled into the cave's consciousness. The resolution is earned through her acceptance of this new reality, a clear choice to embrace unpredictability, with the cost being her old identity and goal.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in her work—is established early and re-contextualized by the ending. The narrative deepens effectively when Elara blows the trumpet, an act of agency that forces the story's central revelation. While the cost (the weight of her new role) is felt, the conflict with the "town's elders" remains off-page, meaning the on-page pressure is primarily atmospheric rather than oppositional.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: choosing between mapped safety and the unknown. Pressure escalates effectively from a mundane mystery to a metaphysical test. The final choice to punch the ticket is driven by Elara's agency and carries a clear, felt cost—the forfeiture of her previous, predictable life. The single, decisive tightening is well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake is Elara's internal search for meaning, which is signaled early. The pressure escalates through a series of atmospheric and magical deepenings, which fits the Accumulative lens. The primary weakness is the lack of a legible price; the resolution is achieved with no significant loss or sacrifice, making the conflict feel low-stakes and its resolution somewhat frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—Elyr’s existential ennui—is signaled immediately and effectively drives his every action. The conflict escalates under a clear causal lens, as his curiosity leads to progressively riskier actions that culminate in a reality-altering event. The price of his choice is made unmistakable in the wreckage of his environment and the shift from a known stasis to a perilous unknown. This is a very strong execution of conflict and stakes for a short story, with agency and consequence tightly linked.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Clara's need for truth versus her father's scheme—is signaled early and sharpens effectively into the final confrontation. The pressure escalates coherently upon the father's arrival, forcing a choice driven by protagonist agency. The cost of this choice (abandoning the con) is legible and reconfigures the characters' future, satisfying the core requirements for conflict at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—capturing the history—is established early and pursued consistently. Pressure escalates effectively when the hum intensifies, leading to a decisive climax. However, the conflict is largely external and metaphysical; Elara's victory feels more like a successful reception than a hard-won struggle that forced a costly trade-off on her part, which slightly softens the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—preserving memory against erasure—is established early and powerfully deepened. The discovery of the container of archives serves as a significant escalation, shifting the conflict from a personal, fragmented search to a large-scale guardianship. The cost is legible in the final beat: the acceptance of a profound, lonely responsibility, which makes the resolution feel earned and weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—decoding the grandfather's riddle—and effectively deepens the pressure through the non-causal escalation of playing the cello. The climax delivers a decisive shift in understanding, and the cost is legible: Mara must abandon the comfort of a solvable problem for the more challenging state of embracing impermanence. The conflict is coherent and resolves with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—the city's soul versus gentrification—is established early and tested at the climax. The escalation is present but lacks teeth; the community rallies with little depicted internal friction or cost. The resolution is earned by Lira's agency, but the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral because the threat from Vorin is so easily overcome on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes its dominant stake—preservation versus progress—early and effectively deepens it with the mentor's personal message. Elara's agency in choosing to "outlast the dawn" creates a clear point of tension against an immovable deadline. The cost of her defiance is felt in the bittersweet ending, making the conflict resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—repairing the drone and restoring trust—is established early and resolved. The rising anchor of the ship provides a soft, atmospheric pressure that frames the narrative. However, the conflict lacks a significant tightening or reversal; Elara's success feels inevitable from the start, which lessens the tension and makes the stakes feel lower than they could be. The resolution is earned through her skill, but not through overcoming a tangible setback.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—Elara's lifelong quest—is established immediately and tested throughout. Pressure escalates effectively under an Accumulative lens, with each new sign (falcon, vibration, mist) deepening her knowledge and narrowing her focus. The resolution is earned through her agency in interpreting these signs, and the cost—the end of a lifelong pursuit—lands with palpable weight in the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the town's revival—is established immediately and pursued relentlessly. Under the accumulative lens, the escalation is successful, building not through direct confrontation but through the increasing density of effect as Elias's patient actions cause the environment to respond. The final resolution is earned through his agency, and the cost—his permanent role as guardian—is made explicit, lending weight to the achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes a strong initial stake: survival against a dwindling oxygen supply. Unfortunately, this primary conflict is deflated rather than resolved. The pressure shifts to a mental puzzle, and the original life-or-death stake is simply forgotten with the line "the distress signal... now felt unnecessary." This shift diffuses the tension and makes the ultimate resolution feel unearned against the initial threat.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—redemption and freedom—is established early and powerfully deepened at the midpoint. The conflict escalates effectively from an external mystery (missing guards) to a high-stakes internal moral choice, a meaningful tightening driven by the protagonist's agency. The final decision carries a clear, if conceptually articulated, cost, successfully foreclosing the path of silence his father took.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—repaying a debt for freedom—is established early and undergoes a significant deepening. The arrival of the other spirits is a powerful intensification, transforming a personal conflict into a collective one and raising the cost of freedom. The protagonist's agency is confirmed in her final decision to accept this heavier burden, demonstrating a clear escalation that is resolved through a stance change with a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming ruin into reverence—is established early and held throughout. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation works as a deepening of texture and pattern rather than a series of reversals. The "tightening" occurs as her "sleepwalking paths began to overlap more frequently," creating coherence. However, the conflict lacks visceral pressure; it is a task of endurance rather than a struggle against active opposition, which keeps the stakes from feeling imminently perilous.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The internal stake—rebuilding faith—is well-established and the story's pressure is atmospheric, fitting the accumulative drive. The resolution is earned through her patient methodology. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful on-page test or obstacle; the orchard seems to guide her rather than resist her, keeping the pressure from escalating sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the letter before it's mailed—is established, and the time limit provides a source of pressure. However, the conflict is procedural rather than dramatic. Lyra faces a puzzle without any meaningful opposition or unexpected complications, which lessens the tension and makes the resolution feel inevitable and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—control over the observatory's cosmic connection—is established with the "urgency" of the chart and decisively tightened by Lira's revelations. The threat is made concrete (extinguishing the flame), and Elara's agency in choosing to act drives the resolution. The cost is legible in her acceptance of a dangerous new reality, making the escalation and its price unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—resolving unspoken regret—is signaled early and escalates through a series of deepening revelations rather than direct reversals. The discovery that the final letter is her own provides a powerful tightening of the conflict, making it intensely personal. The cost is legible in the spent power of the shard, representing the price of her emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning in destruction—is signaled early and undergoes a meaningful deepening. The conflict escalates from a general task to a specific, high-stakes promise as the notes are decrypted. The protagonist’s agency drives the resolution, and the cost (taking on the "shared anxieties" of the world) is made clear in the final paragraph, securing the story's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Lira’s recovery of her artistic joy—is established well. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal, and the external world offers very little resistance, instead presenting a series of helpful discoveries. The escalation is a progression of revelations, not a tightening of pressure or a narrowing of options. The final choice to paint is a resolution, but it isn't forced by a crucible moment; it's an invitation she accepts without a visible trade-off or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central conflict—methodical certainty versus surrendered curiosity—is clearly established and tied to the dominant stake of restoring the mural. The confrontation with the obsidian-eyed woman provides a meaningful tightening point, forcing a choice. However, the lack of significant resistance from the protagonist before she yields makes the escalation feel less tense than it could be; the resolution is earned but happens too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a single, powerful escalation of stakes with great efficiency. The conflict tightens from an intellectual puzzle (deciphering the seed) to a direct physical threat (the presence of another person), culminating in a massive deepening of the stakes with Dr. Krane's revelation. The final choice to fight is a direct result of this pressure, and the cost—the loss of secrecy and the inevitability of confrontation—is made unmistakably clear.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant internal stake—transforming pain into beauty—is signaled early and held throughout. The story achieves a meaningful deepening under its Accumulative lens when "something shifted" and her understanding of the "blossom armistice" was transformed. While this is a clear intensification, the pressure feels entirely internal and lacks external friction or a moment where a tangible alternative is foreclosed, slightly softening the cost of her ultimate choice to complete the work.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and remains the clear focus. The conflict escalates effectively through a textural deepening of pressure, fitting the narrative lens. The climax resolves this pressure through Elara's agency, and the cost (the shattered chime) is made tangible on the page, solidifying the stakes and giving the resolution weight.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring trust—is clear and personal. The internal pressure escalates as Elara commits to the ritual. The primary weakness is that the resolution feels unearned; the conflict is resolved by a magical event rather than a difficult negotiation or act of restitution that addresses her initial recklessness. This convenience deflates the tension and cost that had been building.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central stake—harmonizing the villagers' fear and scholars' curiosity—is clearly established. Yet, the pressure fails to escalate meaningfully. The conflict is presented as an intellectual problem that Elias solves in isolation, with the opposing parties conveniently off-stage. The resolution is frictionless, a perfect compromise that satisfies everyone without any depicted struggle or lasting cost, deflating the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant internal stake—recovering a lost past versus maintaining a safe, invented present—is established early and effectively tightened by the mysterious letter. The escalation is driven by Elara's agency as she shifts from passive observer to active mapper. The final resolution feels earned, with a clear felt cost of abandoning her previous coping mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need for understanding—is internal and well-defined. Pressure escalates atmospherically, culminating in a memory that deepens her knowledge and forces a stance crystallization. The resolution is earned through this internal shift, and the cost is made tangible by leaving the logbook, foreclosing the path of active searching. The escalation is subtle but effective for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—Elara’s search for belonging—is well-defined. The sudden introduction of the collapsing facility provides a decisive, if convenient, tightening of pressure. This external threat forces an immediate choice, creating a clear cost: she must abandon the very moment of connection she sought, making her final internal shift feel earned against a concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear and compelling internal stake: solving the riddle of disappearing memories to heal a personal void. The pressure deepens effectively when Lira's initial, direct approach fails, forcing her to adopt a new tactic. The resolution is driven by her agency, and the cost—accepting the transient nature of memory—is made tangible in her final shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict is abstract (Elias vs. Monotony), and the stakes are primarily philosophical. The story successfully creates a single moment of intensification during the performance, where the crowd's reaction validates Elias's efforts. The climax—the starlight hitting the bishop—provides a decisive resolution to the performance's tension. The cost is the character's ongoing, self-imposed isolation, which is felt in the final quiet moments, making the stakes land with coherence for this type of story.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—artistic preservation versus total erasure—is compelling and established early. The sentinel’s arrival provides a single, effective tightening that forces Lira to crystallize her stance with palpable cost. The conflict loses some of its earned pressure at the very end when the antagonist retreats without a sufficiently dramatized reason, making the resolution feel less hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=3.5)
    Conflict and stakes are critically underdeveloped. The central pressure, a vague, impending "shift," remains abstract and generates no tangible urgency or on-page consequences. Elias faces no obstacles or difficult trade-offs, and his internal journey reads as a smooth, frictionless path to enlightenment rather than a struggle, resulting in a lack of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant internal stake—Elias's struggle with survivor's guilt—is established immediately and effectively deepened. The pressure intensifies through his interaction with the box, culminating in a decisive internal choice to reframe his pain. This renunciation of his old relationship with guilt forecloses a path, and the cost—the permanence of his pain—is made explicit on the page, resulting in a well-earned resolution under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a strong internal conflict (logic vs. intuition) and applies coherent external pressure through the rising tide. The stake—defining hope—is clear. The escalation point is the moment Elara must "revitalize" her patterns instead of abandoning them, a choice that deepens her engagement. The resolution is earned through her agency, and the cost (abandoning her quantifiable goal for a lived one) is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—fulfilling her legacy—is established immediately and effectively tested. The discovery of the diaries and the scholar's warning ("To listen is to lose oneself") provides a single, sharp escalation, raising the personal cost of her quest. The final choice to accept her role as the walls' "voice" is a decisive stance crystallization driven by her actions, with the cost being the transformation of a generational burden into a personal, unending duty.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    The stakes are high, clear, and personal: Elara's own life force. The conflict escalates effectively as the mirrors resist, forcing her to deepen her commitment and "pour her own pulse into the melody." The final resolution is driven entirely by her agency, and the cost is made explicit and visceral, creating a powerful and earned climax.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—ending the forever war—is established immediately and remains the clear focus. Pressure escalates effectively from Elara’s internal crisis of faith to the grueling negotiation. The climax, driven by her choice to abandon negotiation tactics for a raw emotional appeal, is a decisive act of agency that pays off with a legible, personal cost ("lost too much of herself").

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story establishes a single, potent stake—personal redemption against a backdrop of ecological ruin—and tightens the pressure effectively through atmosphere. The rising thunder and the resisting landscape create a palpable tension that culminates in a decisive act of agency. The resolution is earned entirely by her choice, with the rain arriving as a consequence, not a convenience, underscoring the legible emotional cost of her "fractured grace."

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is established early and remains the focus. However, the escalation of conflict is weak. The story states the task is "dangerous," but this danger is never dramatized; Elara proceeds with an unexplained intuition and faces no specific obstacles or moments of near-failure. The pressure is more atmospheric than active, and the resolution feels preordained rather than hard-won against meaningful opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Elias's ethical and artistic purpose—is clear and compelling. The pressure escalates internally until the epiphany provides a decisive turn, narrowing his future options. The primary weakness is the lack of a legible price for this turn; the resolution of the conflict feels frictionless, a clean solution that brings peace without any sense of loss or difficult trade-off for abandoning his old methods.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake is Elara's internal struggle against a sense of loss, symbolized by the absent monarchs. The pressure deepens when the grotto feels "unsettled," intensifying her urgency. However, the escalation is purely atmospheric. While her final action provides a sense of resolution, it isn't a choice forced by narrowing options but rather the completion of a pre-determined ritual. The cost is felt emotionally, but the on-page pressure doesn't force a difficult trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving a lost melody to honor forgotten names—is established early and deepens into a personal quest for self-acceptance. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure escalates through the sustained intensity of Elara's delicate work rather than through external opposition. The cost is legible in the prerequisite of self-forgiveness, making the final resolution feel earned, though the conflict remains primarily gentle and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—deciphering the directive to understand destiny—is established early and remains the focus. The approaching storm provides coherent external pressure that intensifies in parallel with Foresight's internal effort, creating a meaningful deepening of the conflict. The final insight is an earned resolution, with the cost being the loss of the deciphering tool and the completion of one quest only to reveal a larger one.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=2.1)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. The central stake—sealing a covenant—faces no meaningful opposition, internal or external. Kael's search for the tile is resolved with minimal effort, and the puzzle is solved without complication. The proclaimed internal conflict of his "empirically ironic nature" never manifests as a genuine obstacle, making the escalation non-existent and the final resolution feel entirely unearned. There is no tangible cost or sacrifice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—releasing Kael's resentment—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict deepens effectively when Elara moves from metaphorical persuasion to a direct psychic intervention, which Kael actively resists. This provides a meaningful tightening of pressure, driven by protagonist agency, and the final resolution carries a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—capturing a runaway dream by erasing boundaries—is signaled early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates effectively as Elara commits to the mystical process and the fog physically presses in, creating a single, potent deepening of the conflict. The resolution is earned through her agency, and the price paid is the temporary nature of the success, which recharges the stakes for the future rather than definitively ending them.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.0)
    The internal stake—Elara’s need to overcome failure and persist—is well-established. The story achieves a meaningful deepening of her understanding. However, the external conflict used to dramatize this shift lacks significant pressure or opposition. The magical tools work too perfectly, removing any sense of genuine trial or potential for failure in the moment, which makes the subsequent internal victory feel less hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.8)
    The central conflict is Elara's internal bewilderment, and the dominant stake is understanding the cameo's meaning. However, pressure doesn't escalate; it dissolves. The arrival of the "keeper of stories" provides answers that neutralize the tension, rather than forcing a higher-stakes choice. The resolution is given, not earned, and there is no visible price paid for Elara’s new knowledge and purpose, which significantly undermines the story's dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the global stakes are high ("Time is collapsing"), the on-page execution of conflict lacks teeth. Elara overcomes obstacles like traps too easily, with her success attributed to a label ("her resourcefulness") rather than dramatized ingenuity. The final conflict is resolved via a summarized negotiation, deflating tension at the peak moment and leaving the cost of victory feeling abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the garden to recapture a lost part of herself—is established early and drives the narrative. Pressure deepens effectively under the Accumulative lens, moving from environmental exploration to a pivotal internal shift spurred by the narrative threads. The final choice is made with agency, and the cost (the dissolving card, the acceptance of her nature) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: deciphering the secret of the seal. The pressure is primarily intellectual and escalates coherently as Elara connects the seal to the rope and the door. The resolution is earned through her agency, but the conflict lacks significant opposition or a moment of genuine doubt, making the methodical progression feel somewhat low-friction. The final cost—the weight of more work—is present but lacks visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.2)
    The global stake—the world's harmony versus the beings' chaos—is clear, but the on-page conflict lacks escalating pressure. Lira proceeds from one step to the next with near-perfect competence and no significant setbacks. The solution feels pre-ordained rather than earned through a struggle that forces a difficult trade-off or a genuine test of her abilities.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict escalates effectively, moving from an external, technical challenge (aligning star paths) to a profound internal one with a steep, personal cost (sacrificing memory). This deepening of the stakes is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency and makes the final resolution feel earned. The cost is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—preserving and understanding collective memory—is clear and effectively deepened. The escalation from a technical measurement to a direct, visionary communion with the past works well within the accumulative structure. The final cost, the emotional weight of her new role as a conduit, is legible and earned by the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—overcoming hopelessness—is clear, but its atmospheric nature makes the opposition feel passive. The escalation works well for the accumulative lens, deepening from chants to fire to the mosaic's creation. However, the lack of a moment where Lira's success seems genuinely in doubt limits the tension and keeps the conflict from feeling truly sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story effectively dramatizes an internal conflict. The stake—validating her unique professional method against her mentor's critique—is clear and personal. The escalation is a deepening of understanding driven by her own agency, which is appropriate for the textural lens. The resolution is earned, and the implied cost—facing Kael with this new, profound perspective—is legible and gives the ending its forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—psychological freedom versus enforced safety—is established immediately and tested under the pressure of a clear time limit (the one-hour inversion). The escalation is effective, moving from quiet preparation to a tense ascent. The cost is legible in the final paragraph: she has won a new perspective but must return to her prison, a state that is now more unbearable than before.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The stake—Mira's inner peace—is established early and the conflict is appropriately scaled. The tightening beat, when the vial swirls in response to Mira's agitation, provides a clear point of pressure that motivates Elias's decisive action. The resolution is driven by his agency, and the cost for Mira (letting go of her anxiety) is legible in her changed demeanor, fulfilling the narrative promise.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the throne—is established immediately, but the conflict unfolds as a series of unopposed competence checks. Lira solves each puzzle without significant setback, error, or cost. The "until sunrise" timeframe is introduced but never leveraged to create tangible pressure, diminishing the tension. The lack of a meaningful escalation or a moment where Lira's success seems genuinely in doubt makes the conflict feel low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake—the sanctuary's survival—is established immediately and tested under escalating pressure. The conflict tightens decisively when Lira's standard methods prove insufficient, forcing her to make a sacrificial choice. The cost of this choice is paid on the page, making the resolution feel earned and impactful, demonstrating strong control over tension and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the core stake (rebuilding after trauma) is clear, the on-page conflict lacks meaningful escalation or pressure. Elara faces no significant obstacles, setbacks, or adaptive opposition in the parallel dimension. The resolution is achieved by following instructions without struggle, making the conflict feel static and the stakes untested.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the dominant stake is clearly established, the story lacks meaningful escalation or conflict. Eleanor faces no significant opposition; her first and only attempt to uncover the truth succeeds without complication, reversal, or a rising sense of risk. The pressure is static, and the cost of the truth is only revealed after the conflict is over, not paid as a price to win it.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal stake is signaled early and intensifies effectively through the mystical phenomena. Alaric's agency in choosing to trace the patterns constitutes a meaningful turn, narrowing his options to either accept or reject transformation. The resulting cost is clear and directly linked to this choice, making the resolution feel earned and decisive under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s internal quest for meaning against the backdrop of her own trauma—is clear and compelling. The pressure deepens effectively under the Accumulative lens as each new clue increases her personal investment. The final decision to write the story represents a decisive crystallization of her stance, with the cost being the emotional labor of connecting this history to her own.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the truth before being caught—is signaled early and escalates effectively with the arrival of the enforcers. This pressure forces a pivotal choice, and Mara's adaptive response (broadcasting the data) is a strong moment of agency that raises her personal stakes while achieving her primary goal. The cost is clear and charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—protecting the grotto from a prophecy—is signaled early and held consistently. Escalation is handled expertly through an accumulative deepening of pressure: the moss brightens, the prism rotates, the mist shimmers. This intensification, driven by the protagonist's persistent action, leads to a resolution where the cost (physical and mental effort) is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—decoding the arbor's secrets—is clear, but the conflict is nearly non-existent. Elara faces no significant obstacles, opposition, or difficult trade-offs; her path from discovery to acceptance is unimpeded. The story deepens her knowledge but never truly tightens the pressure or narrows her options, resulting in a low-tension narrative where the resolution feels inevitable rather than earned against resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—the tinkerer’s internal search for purpose versus precision—is established early and remains the focus. The journey provides a clear vector of escalating pressure, moving him from a place of familiar frustration to one of profound discovery. The final choice to leave the map behind represents a meaningful renunciation that pays off the internal conflict with a felt sense of peace as its consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story effectively builds pressure toward a single, meaningful deepening. Elara’s agency in stepping into the furnace drives the resolution, and the stakes—understanding and redemption—are tested directly. The cost is made legible through the on-page emotional shift from "luminous regret" to "quiet resolve," providing a satisfying, earned conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the release of the grieving soul—is established early and tested directly. The conflict escalates not through reversals but through a deepening of the confession, which is a valid form of pressure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, though the story's overall structure is Causal. The protagonist's agency in playing the harp directly causes the resolution, and the cost is made visible in the spent relic and the emotional weight she carries forward.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—to discover the mathematics of mercy—is well-established and deepens as Elara moves through the forest. The intensification of the light and the sense of a "threshold" provide a meaningful pressure point. The final renunciation (releasing the strap) pays off this pressure with a clear, felt cost, crystallizing her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming forgotten histories—is signaled early and pursued with focus. The conflict escalates through a clear sequence of discoveries, with each step driven by the protagonist's agency. The final resolution is earned directly through her actions, and the fading light of the fragment provides a tangible sense of consequence, marking the price of fulfillment.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—appeasing the restless spirits—and escalates the pressure coherently. Marcus's agency drives the plot from investigation to decisive action. The climax resolves the immediate conflict, and the cost, while not physical, is made legible in the final sentence, confirming his burden is cyclical and inescapable. This final beat provides the necessary weight to an otherwise straightforward resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central conflict between order and chaos is well-established, and the stakes—Elara's purpose and understanding of reality—are clear. Pressure deepens effectively as she moves from observation (the frost) to action (opening the bottle, stepping off the platform). The climax reweights her core motivation with a visible cost (the abandonment of her quest for "perfect systems"), demonstrating a successful escalation under the story's textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=5.4)
    The stakes for Elara's reputation are high, but the on-page conflict is minimal. The central "archaeological dispute" is entirely off-stage, and her climactic infiltration and ritual are unopposed and without complication. The story lacks a meaningful escalation of pressure or a turn that tests her resolve in the present moment.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The central stake—reclaiming the stolen light—is established early and remains the dominant driver. The conflict deepens effectively when Elias realizes the problem is a tether, not a breakage, which redefines his task and raises the stakes from mundane repair to mystical restoration. While the pressure is coherent, the conflict's resolution feels somewhat frictionless, lacking a significant obstacle or trade-off at the climax beyond the foretold expenditure of the chip's magic.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—to find a place beyond explanation—is signaled early and pursued relentlessly. The story achieves a single, powerful deepening of this stake when discovery shifts the goal from finding a place to understanding its meaning. The final choice to let the compass go represents a full payment of the story’s central cost: giving up the tool of seeking in order to embrace what is found. The escalation is internal and environmental, fitting the story's meditative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the slide’s secret—is clear, but the conflict lacks significant pressure or escalation. The storm is an atmospheric threat that conveniently subsides, and there are no meaningful obstacles or trade-offs presented to Mara. The resolution comes from following a magical breadcrumb trail to its foregone conclusion. The "cost" is a newfound responsibility, which feels more like a reward, lacking the visceral price of a path foreclosed or a genuine sacrifice made.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear, compelling internal stake: Can the artist capture an intangible truth? The conflict escalates effectively under an accumulative lens, with the journey to the cathedral serving as a meaningful deepening of commitment. The resolution is driven entirely by Elara's agency—her decision to go, her focused observation, her act of creation—and the final mural represents an earned change in understanding with a legible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth—is signaled early and remains the focus. The tension escalates effectively from quiet determination to a direct, high-stakes plea. The arrival of the figure provides a meaningful turn, and Elara’s agency in choosing to “parley” drives the resolution. The resulting shift from despair to hope feels earned, with the cost of her ongoing burden made clear.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—the revival of the cove—is clear, but the conflict is conceptual and lacks on-page resistance. Escalation is a smooth, linear intensification of the bottle's glow without any setbacks, reversals, or difficult trade-offs. The resolution feels preordained and frictionless, which diminishes the sense that a significant obstacle has been overcome or a high price has been paid.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    The stakes are effectively signaled and deepened, shifting from intellectual curiosity to a profound personal purpose. The protagonist demonstrates agency throughout. The primary weakness is the lack of tangible opposition or risk; the conflict unfolds as a puzzle with readily available clues, which limits the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=3.5)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. While world-level stakes are declared ("destroy or restore the world"), there is no on-page conflict, opposition, or meaningful escalation. Elara faces no resistance, internal or external, in her task to open the vortex. The core action is completed without a trade-off or a price paid, which deflates any sense of tension. The conflict is entirely theoretical.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a dominant stake—understanding the atmosphere—that deepens into a mystical quest. The pressure escalates through a series of sensory cues, leading to a clear climactic choice. However, the conflict is low-friction, and the resolution lacks a tangible cost; the protagonist's agency is exercised without a meaningful trade-off, which keeps the stakes from feeling truly high.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal, spiritual stake is signaled early and maintained throughout. The conflict escalates effectively for an accumulative narrative, with the lantern’s growing power creating a coherent pressure that compels Lira to act. Her agency in choosing to follow and empathize leads directly to the resolution, and the cost is legible, but the absence of any significant obstacle or internal resistance makes the journey feel somewhat preordained and lacking in tension.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the dominant stake—restoring the covenant—is clear, the story lacks meaningful pressure or conflict. Elias faces no opposition, no setbacks, and no difficult trade-offs. The escalation is a simple, frictionless accumulation of clues, rendering the final victory feel preordained rather than hard-won. The cost of the conflict is entirely externalized to the long-dead ghosts, leaving the protagonist's journey without a palpable sense of risk.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.2)
    The initial stake—"time itself had grown uncertain"—is high, but the pressure fails to escalate. The conflict is resolved through a linear, obstacle-free path: the garage sale works almost immediately, the expert provides a complete solution, and the final device is activated without complication. There is no meaningful tightening of options or a visible price paid for the resolution, which makes the stakes feel declared rather than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—the wanderer's need to rediscover beauty—is clear, but the conflict lacks significant pressure. The interaction is cooperative rather than contentious, leading to a gentle deepening of connection instead of a tense escalation. While a cost is paid (the feather), the path to resolution is smooth and devoid of any real opposition, which diminishes the impact of the final earned harmony.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—creating a legacy before death—is established immediately and remains the central driver. The pressure of the six-month timeline is constant, and the conflict deepens effectively when Elias discovers the carvings, shifting his goal from mere remodeling to revival. The resolution is earned through his sustained action, and the cost is legible and final.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal stake—understanding the chemistry of homecoming—is clear and consistent. The pressure escalates atmospherically, and the encounter with the pilgrim provides a meaningful deepening of Elara's quest, testing her solitary, skeptical approach. The resolution is earned, but the cost (the loss of her skepticism) is framed as an entirely positive "awe," which slightly softens the impact of the trade-off that should accompany a significant change in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—the spiritual reclamation of a dead world—is established immediately and maintained with focus. While the conflict is primarily atmospheric (character vs. desolation), the pressure deepens effectively through the quiet, ritualistic action. The story achieves a meaningful intensification as the coachman's internal resolve crystallizes, and the price of his lonely, persistent effort is felt throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—solving a riddle—is low and primarily intellectual, generating minimal tension. The pressure on Elias is slight, driven by curiosity rather than survival or loss. The resolution arrives as an insight without a meaningful trade-off or visible price paid, making the conflict feel static and its conclusion emotionally weightless.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara will find purpose or remain a burdened pariah—is internal and clear. The conflict deepens effectively when her focus shifts from the stars to the "spaces between them," a turn that reconfigures her knowledge and solidifies her purpose. This internal escalation is driven by her agency (the act of sketching and observing), and the resulting resolve carries the felt cost of her new, heavy responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    A single, dominant stake—restoring the sky—is established early and tested directly. The conflict escalates well from a physical journey to a strategic and sacrificial climax at the chessboard. The final move, a "daring swap of his queen for the spire's rook," serves as a meaningful tightening choice by the protagonist, demonstrating a willingness to pay a price and earning the resolution. The cost is legible and drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant internal stake—Elara's need to "unbind" herself—is established early and tested. The pressure escalates appropriately for an accumulative story, moving from passive contemplation to active participation in the walking ritual. This action serves as the pivotal deepening, forcing a stance crystallization that pays a visible cost: she must confront the way her past roles have been a shield, thereby foreclosing that path.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake: resolving the pain of the past to understand the meaning of home. The pressure deepens effectively with the discovery of the stone and the rising "hidden thunder." The climactic choice to "seed" her thoughts is an act of agency that resolves the conflict, but the cost—the past pain she had to endure—is a sunk cost rather than a price paid in the moment of decision, which slightly softens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s need for self-forgiveness—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict deepens effectively when the tapestry forces her to confront a direct parallel to her own past, a meaningful turn that shifts her from observer to participant. The resolution carries a legible cost: absolution is denied in favor of a difficult, ongoing process, making the final stance feel earned and credible.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake—Lira’s need to reframe forgiveness—is signaled early and remains dominant. The pressure escalates effectively under the accumulative lens as the spire's reactions grow from a hum to a full projection of her past, forcing a deeper reckoning. This leads to a clear deepening of her understanding, and the cost is legible on the page, satisfying the requirements for a high-impact conflict arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—to salvage memory from oblivion—is clear and compelling. The pressure escalates effectively when unlocking the memories triggers the workshop's collapse, creating a new, immediate physical threat. Elara's final act of narration is a clear moment of agency that resolves the crisis, demonstrating a meaningful tightening of pressure that forces a decisive stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central internal conflict—healing and reconnecting with the world by fulfilling an artistic promise—is established early and holds focus. The discovery of the oasis provides a meaningful deepening of the stakes, forcing a choice to engage with her promise in a new, more vulnerable way. The final resolution feels earned, with the cost being the surrender of her protective aloofness.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant internal stake—Elias's need to validate his quiet nature—is established early. The pressure deepens as he climbs the lighthouse and focuses his intent. However, the final confrontation lacks true escalation; the mysterious woman provides affirmation, not a test or a final barrier. The resolution is achieved without a significant, visible cost or a choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—overcoming loss and isolation—and escalates the pressure effectively. The arrival of the first traveler is a meaningful turn that confirms Mara's success while revealing the immense scale of her new responsibility. The cost of this new role is made legible in the final paragraphs, solidifying the conflict's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—Elias's control over his own mind and psychological safety—is established immediately and tested under escalating pressure. The conflict forces the rational protagonist to embrace a superstitious solution, a strong character-driven turn. The resolution is earned directly through his agency in performing the ritual, and the cost of his new wisdom is legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a compelling psychological stake—the need to decode a memory—and escalates it effectively through a series of deepenings. The discovery of the boot print tightens the mystery, and finding the journal constitutes a major turn that redefines the stakes from curiosity to responsibility. The protagonist's agency drives this escalation, and the cost—accepting the stranger's isolation—is made legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=2.5)
    Conflict is virtually non-existent. Elias faces no opposition, no obstacles, and no difficult trade-offs on his path to discovering his purpose. The stakes shift from personal (loneliness) to cosmic ("restore that balance") but remain entirely abstract and untested on the page. There is no escalation of pressure, resulting in a flat and tensionless narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery—is clearly signaled and effectively escalates upon entering the grotto. However, the final conflict is resolved by a cooperative antagonist who simply explains the problem and the solution. This lack of friction at the climax means the resolution, while costly in responsibility, feels less earned by the protagonist's struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—successfully capturing and sharing a moment—is established, but the story lacks meaningful conflict or pressure. There is no opposition, external or internal, and no credible risk of failure; Kael's trust is immediate, and the nexus itself seems to cooperate. The escalation is purely atmospheric rather than a tightening of options or a raising of cost, making the successful resolution feel predetermined and low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—overcoming creative paralysis born of self-envy—is clear and compelling. The pressure deepens effectively from the initial state of confusion to the active confrontation in the dreamscape. The final choice to accept her continuum of selves is driven by her agency, and the cost (releasing her defining jealousy) is legible, resolving the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to find meaning in her loss by understanding the screw—is signaled early and effectively deepened by Mira's arrival. The climax provides a powerful intensification of this internal conflict, and the cost (her permanent sensory loss) is clear. The resolution is earned through Elara's agency in choosing to engage with the object and its history.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    The internal stake—overcoming self-doubt—is clearly signaled and effectively tested. The storm's arrival provides a single, meaningful tightening of pressure that forces Elara to act. The resolution is driven by her agency, and the cost of confronting her anxieties is legible. The conflict arc is complete and satisfying, though the ultimate price feels more therapeutic than transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant internal stake—the need for forgiveness—is effectively pressurized by the external "ticking clock" of the orchard's demolition. The escalation is a deepening of understanding ("Miracles aren't perfect") rather than a physical turn, which is fitting for the lens. The cost is clear: accepting imperfection and permanent loss to find peace.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.2)
    The stakes—unifying existence, unraveling cosmic illusions—are astronomically high but entirely abstract. The conflict is conceptual, lacking any tangible opposition, setback, or risk of failure. The witness's journey is a smooth, inevitable progression toward enlightenment. While the story's Accumulative lens doesn't require a physical antagonist, the absence of any form of pressure or difficult trade-off makes the final "unification" feel unearned and dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the nature of time—is clear. However, the story lacks a meaningful tightening of pressure driven by the protagonist's agency. The crucial turn is an accident, not a choice made under pressure that forecloses other options. The final cost is purely conceptual, and its legibility is weakened by the convenient discovery that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara's professional and philosophical worldview—is clear and consistently held. The appearance of the stranger provides a meaningful tightening point that forces a choice. However, the conflict is resolved through dialogue and acceptance rather than through a more active test or trade-off, which lessens the feeling of pressure. The cost is conceptual—the loss of her old certainty—but it feels more like a gentle release than a price paid under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal conflict is well-defined, with the stakes centered on Elara's ability to find meaning in her father's chaotic legacy. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens effectively through her interaction with the scrawls and her memories. The final decision to begin writing is a clear act of agency that crystallizes her stance, foreclosing passive contemplation and accepting the cost of the difficult work ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    The central stake—Eli's internal battle between isolation and connection—is established immediately and tested under escalating pressure. The story deepens this conflict through Eli’s active choice to play the disc, a turn driven by his agency that leads to a final resolution with a clear, emotionally resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=4.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the locket’s story—is clear, but the conflict lacks pressure and escalation. The central mystery is solved not through struggle or cleverness, but by a single, convenient conversation with an omniscient elder. This lack of meaningful opposition or complication results in a flat trajectory where the stakes are resolved without being genuinely tested.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding a cure for loneliness—is well-defined from the outset. However, the conflict lacks significant escalation or pressure; Elara faces no meaningful opposition or difficult trade-off. The resolution arrives without a tangible sacrifice, making the earned victory feel soft and diminishing the stakes in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—mapping an internal, emotional landscape—is established early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates effectively through textural details (the faltering hum, the insistent melody, the heavy air), consistent with the story's lens. The resolution is earned through Elara's agency in completing the journey, and the cost is made legible by the permanent alteration of her heirloom compass, foreclosing its previous function.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—correcting the anomaly—is established early and escalates when Elara enters the void. However, the conflict within the void resolves too smoothly. Once the pen activates, her success feels preordained, lacking a moment of struggle, a difficult trade-off, or the threat of an unintended consequence that would have heightened the tension of the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—Elara's quest for a legacy against the threat of being forgotten—is clear and potent. The conflict is primarily internal, which suits the story's contemplative tone. The camera's click serves as the single meaningful intensification under the Accumulative lens, reweighting her understanding of her project. The cost is legible in her bittersweet acceptance of a solitary triumph, though the escalation relies on a supernatural event rather than a choice made under direct pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.1)
    The story establishes a clear goal but fails to generate meaningful conflict or stakes. The protagonist moves through the archive unopposed, solving each puzzle without error, setback, or external pressure. This lack of escalation or a single tightening turn makes the journey feel frictionless and inevitable, fundamentally undermining tension and the sense that the goal was ever truly at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—finding agency within her manipulated memories—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict deepens effectively when the lagoon responds to her drumming, a turn driven by her own subconscious action. This moment changes her knowledge and reframes her options, leading to a resolution where she seizes agency. The cost is legible in her acceptance of the collective grief, making the final stance feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—proving the power of subtlety over force—is clearly signaled and tested in the final confrontation with Mira. Pressure escalates effectively through the storm and the labyrinth's resistance, leading to a peak where Eli must act. Eli's choice to use the key demonstrates agency, and the cost is the emotional risk of the challenge. However, the external conflict's resolution via a perfectly matched key and lock feels too convenient, slightly undermining the earnedness of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—the stranger's internal battle with despair—is established effectively through subtext and the "stillwater tension." Pressure deepens through the guardian's quiet, persistent actions, creating a safe but expectant space that compels the stranger's confession. The resolution feels earned, with the cost being the stranger's act of vulnerability. The conflict operates successfully within the Accumulative lens, relying on atmospheric pressure rather than direct confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=2.1)
    This is the story's most significant failure. There is a complete absence of meaningful conflict, either internal or external. Elias's plan unfolds without any obstacles, resistance, or complications, and his team of "like-minded individuals" materializes without effort. The pressure is static, and there is no escalation or tightening of stakes, which makes the resolution feel hollow.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The internal stake—embracing her true nature—is signaled clearly. The conflict intensifies on the island, forcing a decisive choice to "detach." The cost is legible in giving up the scrimshaw and her old self. However, the external barrier is a direct mirror of the internal conflict, which simplifies the pressure rather than complicating it.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a powerful internal stake—psychological survival—and successfully deepens it. The reveal of her brother's fate is the story's key turn, raising the emotional stakes and re-framing Elara’s whittling from a coping mechanism to a deliberate act of resistance. This deepening provides sufficient escalation under an accumulative lens, and the cost of her quiet rebellion is made palpable by the story's end.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—the poet's desire to transcend creative and spiritual boundaries—and escalates it effectively. The pressure deepens through the intensification of the colonnade's humming and the cracking of the lake, forcing the poet's decisive act of surrender. The cost, a dissolution of self, is made palpable on the page and directly informs the final state of resonant change.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.5)
    The central stake—Elias’s search for beauty—is established but the conflict remains at a low, philosophical pressure. The story lacks a meaningful tightening or escalation that forces a difficult trade-off. The resolution is an gentle epiphany rather than a choice made under duress, and the associated cost is too soft to feel significant, making the final moment pleasant but not truly earned.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story builds pressure effectively through an internal conflict. The dominant stake—Elara's quest to understand connection—is deepened with each sound she experiences, forcing a re-evaluation of her core beliefs about progress. This intensification is driven by her agency (choosing to listen) and culminates in a final stance crystallization where the cost—the loss of a simplistic worldview—is clear and deeply felt, charging her new purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.5)
    The internal stake—overcoming grief—is established, but the story lacks meaningful escalation. Elara exists in a state of static ritual until the magical climax, which acts as an external resolution. Because the transformation is not a result of her agency against rising pressure, and comes without a visible cost, the conflict feels resolved rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth of the crash—is signaled early and meaningfully tightened by Mira's arrival, shifting it from academic to urgent. The escalation is clear as they piece together the conspiracy. The cost is legible on a societal scale, but the personal price for the protagonists remains a future threat, slightly softening the immediacy of the stakes in the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—the pursuit of forbidden knowledge at the cost of innocence—and effectively deepens it. The escalation, fitting an accumulative lens, occurs when the vague sense of mystery intensifies into a specific, tangible clue (the erased pattern), forcing a choice. The resolution is earned through protagonist agency, and the cost lands with the final realization, re-pricing her entire quest from an external goal to an internal transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: understanding the shadow unbound. The pressure effectively escalates when the shadow manifests physically, shifting the conflict from academic to immediate and forcing a choice. The resolution is driven by Elara's agency, and the cost is legible as a profound emotional weight. This act of preservation forecloses the passive path of mere observation, making the ending an earned re-stabilization.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The internal stake—reconstructing identity after betrayal—is clear and well-defined. The narrative achieves a meaningful deepening when Elara's perspective shifts from victimhood to active rebuilding, a turn catalyzed by her reflection on the chameleon's nature. This reweights her options from passive sorrow to purposeful action, and the cost of her shattered certainty is consistently felt as the price of this new resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara's internal quest for wholeness—is established early and effectively tightened by the plants' urgent, telepathic message. This external pressure forces a clear, protagonist-driven choice to enter the tunnel. The resolution is directly earned by her agency in confronting her past and completing the climactic action, with a clear cost demonstrated by the painful memories she endures.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story establishes a unique, intangible stake—finding the repository of unused love—and successfully dramatizes it. The conflict deepens effectively when the discovery transforms the stake from a search for a place into a question of responsibility. Elara's final decision demonstrates clear agency, accepting the cost of this new burden, which solidifies the stakes and provides a satisfying, earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—freeing trapped creativity—is clear. Escalation adheres perfectly to the Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through intensification of sensory details (the aurora's song swelling, the archway glowing) rather than a causal plot turn. The final moment crystallizes Lira's stance, and the cost of her commitment is made legible through her fear and the acknowledgment of future challenges.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.0)
    The central stake—the survival of hope embodied by the sparks—is established early and tested in the climax when Mara finds the archive dying. Protagonist agency is clear in her choice to use the clock. However, the conflict lacks significant opposition or complication; the pressure is situational and resolved by a single, successful action, making the escalation feel linear and the cost purely conceptual rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—Eamon's internal quest for insight—is signaled early and remains the focus. The pressure deepens as the phenomena around him grow more strange and his translocations more purposeful. The final confrontation with the machine provides a clear tightening. The resolution, however, lacks a visible trade-off; the gear simply works, granting insight without a dramatized cost or a difficult choice, making the earned victory feel slightly too easy.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—finding "unused courage"—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, which is appropriate for the Accumulative lens. Pressure deepens effectively through the ferryman's enigmatic guidance and the physical act of the traverse. The final resolution is driven by Mara's agency—her acceptance and symbolic action—and the cost (her former life) is what makes the final freedom feel earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a strong, dominant stake—understanding the fortress's silence—and escalates it effectively from a passive state of endurance to an active investigation. The climax delivers a significant deepening of this stake, transforming it from a question of tranquility to one of fear. The cost of this new knowledge is made tangible in the final beat, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—unmasking the pretender—is established immediately and pursued relentlessly. The conflict tightens effectively when the pretender responds, turning the campaign into a direct duel ("The drift is not mine alone."). This escalation, driven by Elara's choices, leads to a confrontation where the accumulated pressure forces the pretender's hand, and the cost of their fraud is made vividly clear.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the mysterious page—is signaled early and deepens effectively. The discovery of the watermark provides a meaningful tightening of the internal conflict, moving the page from random debris to a deliberate message. The resolution is an earned change in knowledge that reweights Elara’s entire worldview, paying off the setup with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—Lira’s search for purpose—is established early and remains the focus. Under the accumulative lens, the intensification of the stone circle's hum serves as a meaningful deepening of pressure. The resolution is earned by her stance crystallization, and the cost of her new purpose is legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story establishes clear stakes, but the on-page escalation is weak. The arrival of the guard provides a single point of pressure, but his quick and easy submission, followed by his vanishing, prevents the conflict from tightening meaningfully. The resolution of this threat is too convenient to feel earned, leaving the climax without immediate, pressing opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.2)
    The stakes are effectively signaled and escalated. The conflict shifts from an internal struggle for peace to a visceral external conflict when the photograph is endangered, creating a meaningful tightening of pressure. The resolution is driven by Zara’s agency, and the cost—accepting her pain rather than erasing it—is legible. The escalation is sharp and focused on the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—Elara's creative survival—and effectively deepens the conflict. The shift from passive despair to the active redesign of the cards serves as a meaningful tightening of pressure, driven entirely by her agency. The resolution is earned through this choice, and the cost is made legible in the final paragraph: the permanent "ache" is no longer a burden but a muse, foreclosing the possibility of a painless creative life.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding her brother’s death—is signaled early and effectively deepened at the midpoint. The conflict escalates from an external search to an internal confrontation when the nature of the ink is revealed. Elara's agency in choosing to witness the vision and accept its truth feels earned, and the cost—the forfeiture of her anger and the hope of changing the past—is legible and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—releasing the truths versus maintaining order—is established early and tested directly. The pressure escalates effectively with the "ticking clock" of the network activation, forcing a high-stakes choice. The resolution is earned through Elara's agency, and the cost of her decision is made tangible in her final feeling of dread and triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—protecting a sanctuary of peace—is immediately clear and effectively tightened by Kael’s arrival. Elara's choice to accept the blade is a meaningful turn with a clear cost: the loss of her sanctuary's ideological purity. The conflict is compelling but lacks further escalation; after the single turn, the external threat remains abstract and the tension plateaus rather than builds toward the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—restoring cosmic harmony by catching the goddess's echo—is established early and remains central. The conflict escalates effectively under an accumulative lens as Kael's deliberate mirroring of the chaotic stars deepens the atmospheric tension. The resolution is driven by his agency, and the cost—the goddess departing, leaving only her song—is clear and thematically resonant, providing a satisfying sense of earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is clear, but the escalation of pressure feels indirect. The primary antagonists (the journalist's threat, the director) act off-page or in summary, which dampens the tension. While Eleanor’s choice to intervene does represent a meaningful tightening, the on-page cost is implied danger rather than a felt, immediate consequence, making the conflict feel more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's internal battle against guilt-fueled dissonance—is established immediately and remains the focus. The discovery of the letters provides a decisive deepening, forcing her to engage her trauma directly. Her choice to write back demonstrates clear agency, and the resulting peace is an earned resolution with a legible emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The primary stake—discovering meaning—is established early and tested. The conflict escalates texturally, with the deepening silence and shifting mandala providing coherent pressure. The climax, where the mandala reveals the story of the silenced people, effectively deepens the stakes and clarifies the cost. The resolution lands with a visible price: the unease remains, transformed into a necessary burden.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—renaming reality to center mercy—is established early. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pressure deepens as Elara moves from passive reflection to active creation, which functions as the story's single, meaningful intensification. However, the conflict is entirely internal and philosophical, lacking any on-page opposition or immediate, tangible cost that would test the "arms of steel" mentioned in her motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—rescuing a past self from despair—is established and tested effectively. The escalation is a single, potent deepening when Mara confronts her echo's despair, which is sufficient for this scope. The resolution is earned through Mara's agency, but the conflict's intensity is slightly dampened by the over-explanatory dialogue, making the turn feel more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal conflict is established, and the stake—understanding and healing the damage of the recall—is clear. The pressure builds through the creative act itself, which serves as the story's one meaningful deepening of her engagement with the problem. The final cost is conceptual (the acceptance of a long, fragile mission), which fits the story's tone, but the escalation lacks a sharp, decisive turn that truly tests her commitment with an immediate, tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story establishes a clear stake—understanding the caves' emotional mystery—and escalates it when the fossil reveals its supernatural nature. However, the conflict remains low-pressure throughout, functioning as a puzzle to be solved rather than a struggle with meaningful opposition or difficult trade-offs. The resolution is achieved without a tangible cost or sacrifice, which softens the impact of the final discovery and keeps the tension at a modest level.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.9)
    The central conflict—deciphering the echo—escalates effectively under an accumulative lens as the hum grows and the key button is found, providing a single, meaningful deepening. Protagonist agency drives the resolution through her methodical work. The primary weakness is the lack of a clear trade-off or visible cost in the resolution; success feels complete, which limits the stakes' ultimate resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    The internal stake—reclaiming unused courage—is clear and consistent. The story establishes a single meaningful pressure point: deciphering the codes before a storm. However, the escalation lacks intermediate texture; we are told the method is "precarious," but we don't witness a moment of near-failure or a difficult choice in the process. The final turn feels less like an escalation driven by her agency and more like a discovery that resolves the tension for her.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding the palimpsest promise—is abstract but consistently held. The conflict is primarily philosophical, escalated by the mysterious figure's intervention, which forces the coachman to re-evaluate his method and goal. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's shift in perspective, and the cost is the acceptance of complexity over a simple answer, which aligns with the story's textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=3.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding a mystery—lacks urgency and pressure. There is no antagonist, obstacle, or time constraint to create meaningful tension. The escalation is purely informational, a sequence of discoveries rather than a series of choices made against mounting opposition. The resolution of the conflict is summarized ("the community came together") without dramatizing the struggle, rendering the stakes inert.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire for connection versus her quiet isolation—is signaled effectively. The story escalates pressure texturally, with the "quivering hush" and the mysterious boat deepening the emotional stakes. The tightening occurs when Elara chooses to reveal the tooth, a clear decision driven by protagonist agency that confirms the connection and makes the cost of vulnerability tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding her purpose by reaching the stone circle—is signaled early and remains the focus. Under an accumulative lens, the pressure builds effectively through atmosphere ("air growing heavier") and a single, decisive obstacle (the stone door). This tightening forces the climactic choice, and the resulting transformation carries a clear, if welcome, cost—the dissolution of her former, isolated self. The escalation is sufficient and coherent for the story's design.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.2)
    The central stake—Elara's internal quest for connection—is clear and maintained. The pressure deepens appropriately for an Accumulative lens as she approaches the art installation, leading to the climax. The cost is legible but minimal; the primary weakness is the lack of any significant opposition or friction, making the resolution feel somewhat inevitable and low-conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—countering a manipulative cosmic signal—is established early and escalated effectively through both external community division and direct on-page pressure from Hank. The conflict is resolved through the protagonist's direct agency, and the resolution smartly generates a new, more complex problem (deepened social unrest). The final image makes the cost of her victory—the acceptance of an unending vigilance—palpable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake is established early and tested effectively. The escalation is sufficient for this length, moving from general atmospheric pressure to the acute physical test of the narrow passage, and finally to the psychological crisis in the chamber. The final choice to "embrace the mutiny" is an act of agency that resolves the conflict with a visible, if internal, cost.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—solving the case—is effectively deepened into an internal, existential stake about empathy. The confrontation with the mysterious figure serves as the single, meaningful tightening required at this length, raising both physical and psychological pressure. The cost is clear at the end: the external problem is not solved, but an internal path has been opened, which is a satisfying trade-off under the story's textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—honoring a forgotten legacy—is signaled early and escalates effectively when Elara discovers the exile is reversible, transforming her personal quest into a choice with wider implications. The pressure builds coherently. The final choice provides a resolution, but the abstract nature of the consequences ("restore or protect") makes the cost feel less visceral and immediate than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is clear: solve the hitchhiker's mystery. However, the conflict is almost entirely internal and lacks significant opposition or rising pressure. The escalation is simply a physical journey, with no meaningful setbacks or choices that foreclose other paths. The resolution is a discovery, not a decision made under duress, and it arrives without a tangible cost, which keeps the tension low throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant internal stake—understanding a father's legacy—is well-established and pursued consistently. The pressure escalates appropriately through the discovery of the journal, which deepens the emotional stakes. However, the single point of external conflict with the former partner is too brief and easily resolved to significantly tighten the narrative or force a difficult choice, leaving the overall tension feeling somewhat muted.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story effectively establishes an internal stake (healing) and uses the external puzzle as its engine. The pressure deepens appropriately under the Accumulative lens, culminating in a significant change in knowledge rather than a confrontation. The cost—acknowledging her silent burdens—is legible and gives the resolution weight, even if the escalation itself is quiet and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—the potential destruction of the forest—is established immediately and remains the driving external pressure. The conflict deepens effectively when the external problem becomes inextricably linked to Eira's internal one, raising the personal cost of the solution. The resolution is driven by the protagonist's agency through a difficult choice, and the price she pays (vulnerability and confronting a past failure) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story establishes a clear, high-level stake (mending the covenant), but the on-page conflict lacks genuine pressure. The maze's threats are minimal ("thorns catching on her cloak"), and Elara's progress feels inevitable rather than hard-won. The escalation is a linear progression, not a meaningful tightening of options or a deepening of cost, which deflates the tension before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The central stake—Elara's freedom versus her self-imposed duty—is established early and tested decisively. The pressure deepens effectively, moving from a general sense of obligation to a direct confrontation with the consequences of her choice. The climax forces a stance crystallization, and the cost of her decision is legible and felt, fulfilling the requirements for a high-band score.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake—finding purpose—is signaled early and genuinely tested by the pressure of his recent public failure. The story achieves a meaningful deepening when Elias confronts the meaning of the cloth, which forces a stance crystallization. The resolution is earned, with the cost being the acceptance that purpose is not found but must be built, a burden he actively chooses to take on.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding the physics of transition—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict is primarily internal, pitting Eliara's methodical caution against her yearning for answers. The decision to plant the seed serves as a meaningful tightening, a point of no return that commits her to a riskier path and effectively escalates the spiritual stakes, leading to an earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—stabilizing the town's migrating identities—is signaled early. However, the conflict lacks meaningful escalation. The problem is presented and then solved with a single, successful action. There is no rising pressure, no failed attempt, and the cost of the resolution (identities stabilizing in new forms) is immediately framed as a positive, negating any sense of sacrifice or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    The initial professional stakes are abandoned almost immediately for a mystical quest with vaguely defined pressures. The central conflict—duty versus curiosity—is resolved in a single phrase without a meaningful test of Elara's commitment. The story escalates knowledge and purpose, but not tension; the true, grand stakes are revealed at the end rather than tightened through on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The internal stake—the search for self-forgiveness—is strong and consistently maintained. The pressure escalates not through external events but through a deepening of understanding, catalyzed by the man's appearance. His dialogue provides the key turn, reframing Elara’s approach and making the cost of her journey—confronting her past directly—explicit. This shift is driven by protagonist agency in choosing to accept this new perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—to find an answer—is signaled immediately and deepens into a conflict about her role in the library's ecosystem. The key tightening occurs when she realizes she must become a conduit, a choice forced upon her by the library's mechanics. The cost is clear: her quest for a personal answer is sublimated into a larger, more burdensome purpose, making the resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—a dream of harmony versus an empire of control—is signaled early and effectively embodied by Elara's choice. Pressure escalates well, moving from an internal, divinatory urgency to the immediate external threat of the Dominion scouts. The climax is a direct result of this pressure, and the cost of her action is made clear, foreclosing the violin's future use. The conflict is well-managed and resolved with consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing a spark before oblivion—is signaled early and provides a clear throughline. The story delivers a single, decisive deepening when the traveler awakens and challenges Elara's entire mission, effectively raising the stakes from a physical task to a philosophical crisis. However, the external pressure of the "unraveling" world remains abstract, and the resolution of the internal conflict feels too frictionless to make the final price fully resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's internal contentment—is established early. The discovery of the map provides a meaningful deepening, shifting her from passive yearning to an active quest. However, the resolution comes via a magical guide explaining the solution rather than from Elara overcoming a final, difficult obstacle through her own agency, which softens the earnedness of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—guiding Mara out of her doubt—is established clearly. However, the conflict remains entirely conceptual and lacks visceral pressure. The escalation is a single, gentle deepening from observation to action. While the resolution is earned within the story's low-key framework, the absence of any tangible opposition or risk for Elias makes the conflict feel theoretical and muted. The cost is externalized and speculative (Mara might not change), not felt by the protagonist on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—to reveal a truth and risk chaos versus withholding it and remaining burdened—is signaled early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates effectively during the internal confrontation of the trance, leading to a decisive, character-driven choice. The cost is the emotional weight of her past actions and the uncertain future, which lands with sufficient clarity at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story effectively builds pressure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with the arrival of the flock serving as a decisive deepening of the central stake. The conflict is internal, and its resolution—a redefinition of the initial goal—is driven by the protagonist's agency in interpreting the patterns. The cost is conceptual but unmistakable in the final image, foreclosing the path of external answers.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake is clear and the external conflict escalates effectively with the closing walls, forcing an agentive choice from the protagonist. The resolution, however, feels low-cost. Because Eli overcomes the obstacle with a new skill that works perfectly on the first try, the tension deflates, undermining the internal struggle that was central to the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Elias's quest for purpose—is signaled early and deepens into a concrete goal. The conflict is primarily internal, and the pressure builds atmospherically rather than through an external antagonist. The key turning point, accepting the vow, is a clear escalation driven by protagonist agency. The cost is the burden of a new, profound commitment, which lands with quiet weight in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—the fate of existence and Lira's place within it—is established early and remains the focus. The conflict escalates effectively through a single, meaningful tightening: the successful distillation of the static, which transforms the problem from one of method-finding to one of execution. This turn is driven entirely by Lira's agency, and the resulting cost (her new, heavy responsibility) is unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    The internal stake—overcoming grief-induced stasis—is signaled early and effectively deepened during the climax. Under an accumulative lens, the pressure builds through a series of atmospheric and magical intensifications, culminating in a choice driven by Elara's agency. The cost of her new purpose is made explicit—"the weight of their choices"—which satisfyingly grounds the resolution in consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are cosmic (a dead world) but the conflict is effectively localized in a single, delicate task. The pressure escalates through the fragility of the process—the brittle alloy, the dull sound—rather than external opposition. The resolution, driven by the protagonist's agency in striking the bell, delivers a meaningful change that confirms the stakes and establishes the cost: this small victory is only the beginning of a monumental effort.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the central stake—the town’s soul versus its amnesia—is clear, the conflict is inert. There is no meaningful opposition, external or internal, to test Elias's resolve. The resolution is achieved without any struggle, setback, or price paid, which deflates the tension and renders the victory emotionally unearned. Pressure does not escalate; it is simply replaced by a tidy solution.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story signals its dominant internal stake early and offers a meaningful deepening when the quest shifts from finding an object to performing a ritual. However, the conflict's resolution is weak. The tension between logic and intuition dissolves with minimal resistance, and the final transformation comes without any apparent sacrifice or trade-off. This lack of a palpable cost makes the stakes feel low and the victory emotionally frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving trust by deciphering chaos—is established early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates internally as the character realizes they must "revise their understanding," which serves as a sufficient deepening for this length under a textural lens. While the stakes remain abstract ("breaking the trust that held their world together"), the internal pressure of the "watcher's burden" feels consistent and is resolved through the seeker's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—Kael’s need to overcome emotional numbness—is established early and tested directly. The conflict escalates effectively from static meditation to a direct confrontation, driven by Lira's ultimatum to "integrate or let go." The duel provides a meaningful tightening of pressure, and the resolution is achieved through Kael's agency, with the visible cost of shattering the past self to achieve wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—solving the enigma—and escalates it effectively from a curiosity to a life-altering purpose. The protagonist's agency drives the plot, and the final turn deepens the conflict rather than simply resolving it, landing with a legible conceptual cost. While the conflict is primarily intellectual, its progression and the re-weighting of stakes at the end are handled with skill.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a single, powerful stake—restoring laughter—and escalates the conflict through a deepening of effort rather than external reversals. This fits the accumulative structure perfectly. The cost is made tangible in Eli’s exhaustion and cracking voice, ensuring the final, tentative success feels hard-won and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—Elara's desire to return home versus her duty to the library—is signaled early and effectively tightened by the keeper's arrival. The conflict escalates cleanly when the cost of using the pendant is revealed, forcing a high-stakes trade-off. The resolution through Elara's agency (the choice to wait) is earned, and the cost is made explicit and felt on the page, solidifying the story's emotional core.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant internal stake against a "stifling destiny" is well-established and resolved with a clear choice and cost. The escalation, however, is primarily reflective; the pressure deepens intellectually but lacks a tangible external tightening or complication before the final, single-step resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict is underdeveloped and lacks meaningful escalation. The primary reversal—the shard's light dimming—is introduced and resolved within two sentences, presenting no sustained obstacle or forcing a difficult trade-off. Consequently, the stakes, while conceptually grand, never feel viscerally tested, and the resolution feels preordained rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—the fate of the ferry and its passengers—is signaled early and remains the focus. Stepping into the rift provides a clear point of escalation. However, the conflict’s resolution feels unearned; the problem shifts from merging timelines to resetting time, and the solution appears without a cost proportional to the new, larger problem, weakening the impact of the final victory.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central conflict between the desire for connection and the risk of self-dissolution is focused and compelling. Escalation is handled skillfully through the eruption of illusions and the manifestation of the shadow figure, forcing a clear, high-stakes choice. The cost of her daring is made unmistakable in the fleeting nature of the connection and the chaos of the final attempt.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the preservation of celestial navigation—is established immediately and is compelling. However, the escalation is limited. The conflict is presented, Elara makes one decisive choice, and her success is then summarized in a single paragraph ("Weeks turned into months..."). The lack of a dramatized struggle against the Council makes the resolution feel somewhat unearned and lessens the impact of the victory.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—to answer the call and protect a vulnerable voice—is signaled early and remains the focus. Pressure escalates effectively in a single, meaningful deepening when finding the photograph transforms the vague task into a specific, personal mission ("Protect her story"). The conflict is low-intensity, but the final choice to accept the mission carries a clear, if quiet, cost that resonates beyond the page.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are clear, combining a physical goal with a personal emotional quest. The pressure escalates effectively, from navigating the environment to the metaphysical confrontation in the vault. The climax is driven by Elena's choice to reach for the codex, and the resolution comes with a visible cost: giving up the desire for control and understanding in favor of respect for the unseen.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear and compelling existential stake from the beginning. The conflict deepens effectively when the abstract mystery of Elara's existence becomes a tangible data-recovery problem, forced by her own agency in noticing the inkblot patterns. The resolution is earned directly through her actions, and the cost is the poignant, emotional weight of confronting her alternate self, which is legible in the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—saving a dying language—is established immediately and remains the unwavering focus. Escalation is handled well, as the diamond's curse drains Lira's strength, creating a race against her own physical limits. The cost of success is made viscerally clear, and the resolution is driven entirely by her agency and endurance, making the victory feel hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.2)
    The internal stake (overcoming bitterness) is clear and is tested in the climax. However, the escalation of external pressure is abrupt and not driven by protagonist agency; the garden simply begins to metamorphose *at* her. The resolution is an internal stance change, which is valid, but the path to it relies on a passive experience rather than a series of choices that narrow her options and force the final, costly realization.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—the orchard's life versus the statues' mechanical order—is established early and effectively. The conflict escalates well from passive defiance (music) to active rebellion (using the shell). The tightening is clear when the statues advance on Elara, forcing her to commit to her risky plan. The resolution is driven by her agency, and the cost is legible, making the climax feel earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake and executes a single, meaningful escalation with precision. The drone chase provides a concrete test of the protagonist's skill and resolve, narrowing his options and raising the tension effectively. The resolution is earned through his agency, and the cost—the temporary nature of the success—is made explicit, grounding the fantastical event in a sober reality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.8)
    The internal stake—overcoming stasis—is clear, and pressure intensifies appropriately for an accumulative structure by layering discoveries that enable the climax. The resolution, however, lacks a tangible cost. The carpenter gains a voice and purpose without any visible sacrifice or trade-off, which softens the impact of his transformation. The conflict resolves into a reward rather than an earned, costly change, limiting the stakes' ultimate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—to reawaken the library's spirit—is established early and pursued relentlessly. Pressure escalates effectively under the accumulative lens, with each step of the book-arranging ritual deepening the magical effect. The final confrontation is not with an antagonist but with a fading reality, and her choice to protect it crystallizes her new role with the clear cost of perpetual, solitary duty. The progression is slightly linear but builds to a satisfying and consequential climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—resolving the "cipher of longing"—is established early. The conflict escalates under an Accumulative lens as the atmosphere grows "heavier" and the light begins to "pulse," creating a single, meaningful intensification. The primary weakness is the lack of a visible or felt price at the resolution; Elara trades longing for courage, which reads as an unconflicted win rather than a choice with a tangible trade-off, softening the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=2.5)
    The story fails to dramatize its conflict or deliver on its high stakes. The antagonist, a vault described as a "living entity" with shifting locks, is presented as a formidable obstacle but is overcome on the very first attempt with no struggle or adaptation required from the protagonist. This lack of escalation or meaningful resistance creates zero tension, and the world-saving/destroying stakes are never tested, remaining purely abstract declarations.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—recovering stolen memories—is established early and gains personal weight with the discovery of the locket and photograph. This finding serves as a meaningful tightening, transforming a professional curiosity into an urgent, personal quest. The resolution is earned through Elara's agency in piecing the clues together, not by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding reversible exile through annotation—is established early and tested effectively. Under an accumulative lens, the conflict deepens convincingly from simple nervousness to a palpable sense of being watched and pressured by the shadow. Elara's agency in pushing through this resistance to complete her work makes the final shift feel earned, with the emotional price paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving wonder against a fading world—is established but remains abstract. The conflict is entirely internal and conceptual, lacking any immediate on-page opposition, obstacle, or rising pressure. The "delicate timeframe" is asserted but creates no tangible urgency, resulting in an intensification of mood rather than a true escalation of stakes that tests the character.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict is primarily metaphysical and internal, which is handled with skill. The dominant stake—grounding the spirits to find her own peace—is clear from the start. Pressure deepens effectively under the accumulative lens, moving from a single whisper to a stubborn knot, and culminating in a "flood of whispers." The cost is felt emotionally ("heart heavy"), and the resolution is earned through her persistence and empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the secret of the henge and chapel—is clear and maintained throughout. The conflict escalates through a logical deepening of knowledge, from video analysis to excavation. However, the pressure remains purely intellectual, lacking any significant opposition, setback, or moment of genuine doubt that would test Elara's commitment. The resolution feels earned by her competence, but the absence of struggle mutes the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story builds pressure effectively around a single, dominant internal stake: Elara's quest for understanding. The conflict deepens through her investigation, culminating in a decisive choice driven by her own agency—following the map and internalizing the letter's message. The cost is made tangible and unmistakable on the page through her renunciation of the snow globe, providing a clean and earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake (freeing the ghost) and an excellent temporal pressure point ("between lightning and thunder"). However, the tension generated by this constraint is undermined by the protagonist's frictionless execution. Elara's work is described as guided by an "otherworldly" intuition, which removes any possibility of failure or struggle from the climax, making the conflict feel less hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.2)
    The central stake—deciphering the mentor's message—is clear, but the conflict lacks pressure and escalation. Elara faces no meaningful opposition; she conveniently finds each required item (map, book, page, key) exactly when needed. The ascent feels like a guided tour rather than a genuine struggle, with no risk of failure or sense of urgency. The resolution is achieved through accumulation, not by overcoming escalating resistance, which flattens the tension significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story signals a clear dominant stake—proving the theory—and escalates the atmospheric pressure toward a decisive choice. The leap is a powerful climax driven by the protagonist's agency. The primary weakness is the resolution's failure to deliver a legible cost; the convenient repair of the gondola undercuts the physical danger, leaving the stakes feeling purely conceptual and somewhat deflated in hindsight.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—capturing the infinite before the finite building collapses—is signaled early and remains the focus. Under an accumulative lens, the escalation is effective, conveyed through the groaning and shuddering of the building, which steadily intensifies the pressure on Elara's task. The final choice to complete the art at the cost of the setting provides a clear and meaningful trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The central conflict is a low-stakes intellectual puzzle. While the desire for discovery is established, the pressure never escalates into a meaningful test with tangible consequences for failure. The resolution relies on convenient revelations—the phrasebook falling open, the light simply pointing the way—rather than the protagonist overcoming significant opposition, making the success feel less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the gears to learn the "rhythm of repair"—is established early and pursued with focus. The conflict escalates effectively from an intellectual puzzle (deciphering prophecies) to a direct psycho-spiritual test in the hall of mirrors. This encounter provides a meaningful deepening of the stakes, and the resolution is driven by Elara's agency in enduring this trial, paying a visible psychological cost for her reward.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=3.5)
    This is the story's most significant weakness; there is no meaningful conflict or escalation. The journey to restore the bell is a simple sequence of tasks met with immediate success. There are no setbacks, no opposing forces, and no difficult trade-offs, which results in a complete lack of tension. The stakes are declared but never feel threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The stakes are cosmic yet are grounded in a single, visceral action. The conflict escalates effectively through internal and atmospheric pressure, leading to a meaningful tightening when Elara's lullaby falters. Her renewed determination, a clear act of agency, drives the resolution, and the cost is made unmistakable in her ragged breath and the acceptance of the struggle's cyclical nature.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict is well-managed, with a clear dominant stake that is tested and escalated by the traveler's arrival. This tightening forces an active, risky choice from the protagonist. The resolution is driven entirely by her agency, and the cost—an acceptance of an ongoing struggle against a still-present threat—is made tangible in the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively develops a single, dominant internal stake: moving from grief-induced isolation to integrated connection. The pressure is accumulative, culminating in a decisive insight that deepens her understanding and forecloses her prior coping mechanism (refuge in work). The cost of this shift—accepting her brother's memory as a guide rather than a weight—is made tangible in the final beat, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—finding where stories begin by retrieving the vial—is established immediately and remains the focus. Pressure escalates effectively from the general challenge of the ascent to the specific, high-precision task of incising the glass. This tightening forces the deployment of Elara's core skill, and the resolution is earned directly through her agency with a visible cost (the spent moonlight).

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake and escalates pressure effectively, moving from external remorse to Elara’s personal regrets at the pavilion's heart. This represents a meaningful deepening of the conflict. The primary weakness is that the resolution relies on a protagonist whose core ability is never seriously challenged or compromised; her power to "subsume" works exactly as intended, making the conflict feel more like a task to be completed than a struggle to be overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—mending the community—is clear and present. The story achieves a single, decisive intensification as Elara's song awakens the clock and the crowd. However, the conflict is entirely passive; there is no opposition, setback, or difficult choice, which makes the resolution feel convenient and emotionally unearned. The price paid is catharsis, not a costly trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant internal stake—Elara's need to find purpose amidst personal and societal fragmentation—is signaled early and consistently held. The pressure intensifies texturally through her risky memory-imprinting process. The climax isn't a confrontation but a powerful crystallization of stance, which is a valid resolution under the accumulative lens, with the cost being the vow she makes for her future.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the combinations—is established early. The primary pressure is the rare temporal window of the gravity inversion, which effectively tightens the conflict. The resolution is earned through the protagonist's preparation and direct action. The cost, a newfound responsibility, is clearly stated at the end, providing a satisfying sense of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central conflict—uncovering hidden music from silence—is internal and artistic, fitting the story's tone. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure effectively deepens as Elara focuses her work, amplified by the insulator's presence. The resolution is earned through her sustained action, and the cost, while subtle, is made visible in her physical and emotional state at the end ("hands trembling, her heart full").

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant internal stake—redefining her purpose after exile—is clear and consistently pursued. The pressure escalates effectively as the nexus intensifies, leading to a key deepening of knowledge when the pieces move on their own. The cost of progress (letting go) is symbolized by the knight's sacrifice, but the external stakes ("the next phase") remain too vague to apply maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—accessing the grandmother's diary to understand empathy—is established immediately. Pressure escalates atmospherically rather than through direct opposition, building a palpable tension through Elara's intense focus. However, the resolution of the conflict feels frictionless; the clasp simply opens when the meditative pressure peaks. While fitting for the story's gentle nature, the absence of a meaningful struggle or trade-off keeps the stakes from feeling truly tested.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant internal stake—ambition versus serenity—is established well. Pressure deepens texturally through the waiting period and Elara's heightened sensitivity. The final turn provides a resolution, but the cost feels purely conceptual. The story forgoes a more tangible trade-off, making her transformation feel frictionless and diminishing the weight of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—finding the source of resilience to save the planet—is signaled early and escalates effectively with the discovery that the echoes are fading. The pressure of the approaching gravity inversion provides a good temporal constraint. The conflict is primarily person-versus-environment, which is well-executed, but the lack of a difficult trade-off or a more palpable cost at the resolution keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—unraveling the mystery—is established early and pursued relentlessly. The discovery of the aircraft wreckage at the labyrinth's center provides a meaningful escalation, transforming the incident from storm damage into a complex human tragedy. The resolution is earned through Elara's agency, and the cost (the realization of a preventable disaster) is made explicit in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake is clear and the temporal pressure ("at the moment a sculptor's chisel...") provides a single, effective tightening. The conflict, however, lacks friction. The resolution feels pre-ordained, as Elara faces no unexpected complications or active opposition, and the successful outcome has no visible cost beyond the release of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—retrieving the flute to redeem a past failure—is established early and remains the clear focus. The pressure escalates effectively through internal conflict, as the journey forces Elara to confront her past trauma. The climax is a direct result of her agency, a decisive choice made with a legible and personal cost, which earns the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central stake—understanding connection versus being overwhelmed by it—is established early and tested. The escalation is a single, decisive deepening of pressure when Elias touches the fragment, which is appropriate for this length and lens. His agency drives the climactic moment, and the cost is legible in his struggle to ground himself.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake that evolves from professional duty to existential purpose. Pressure escalates effectively through the pendant's growing activity and the increasingly mythic landscape, consistent with the accumulative lens. The final confrontation with the scholar provides a decisive deepening of the stakes, with the cost of Elara’s new purpose being the forfeiture of her mundane, predictable life.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—proving her theory—is established early and tested by the initial silence that threatens her confidence. The conflict deepens decisively when the expected "data" turns out to be overwhelming grief, shifting the stakes from intellectual validation to an emotional burden. This re-weights the goal and forces a new stance on her, with the cost being her prior detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—to find and deliver an unknown message—is signaled early and deepens effectively with the discovery of the puzzle. The escalation is handled well for an accumulative plot, with the journey imposing a clear cost (leaving home) that is paid off in the final image. The pressure is more mystical than confrontational, but it coheres and forces the protagonist's final, transformative choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—the planet's survival—is established early and effectively. However, the story fails to dramatize the escalation of conflict during the journey. The descent is compressed into a single sentence ("Hours turned into days"), skipping over the specific, rising challenges that would test the protagonist's resolve and earn the climax. This summary replaces a sequence of pressure and adaptation with a statement of endurance, weakening the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—discovering a withheld truth—is signaled early but the conflict remains one of passive inquiry rather than active opposition. The story lacks a meaningful escalation of pressure; Elara's frustration is the only internal obstacle, and it is resolved for her by an external character's arrival. The resolution is the product of coincidence, not a choice made under pressure with a visible cost, which significantly deflates the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—"Protect the light"—is clear and compelling. However, the escalation of conflict relies on discovery rather than pressure from an opposing force, and the protagonist's agency is critically weak at the pivotal moment. The resolution is achieved through a lucky guess, not a clever or costly choice, which deflates the tension and leaves the final stance feeling unearned. The price paid is conceptual (losing an "ache") rather than a tangible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively establishes a stake—shaping a new dawn—and escalates the conflict coherently. The pressure tightens meaningfully when the Herald loses control of the beam, shifting the conflict from routine to crisis. The protagonist's agency is central to the resolution, as they make a clear choice to steer the beam and confront the unknown, with the cost being the transformation of their entire existence.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Kael's need to find purpose for his strange new awareness—is signaled early and effectively deepened. The encounter with the widow provides the single, meaningful intensification required at this length. By forcing Kael to articulate his philosophy to her, the story crystallizes his stance and solidifies the cost of his gift—not as a curse to be solved, but a responsibility to be carried.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding what trees witness—is established early and pursued consistently. Under the accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively as dream fragments reveal the scale of sorrow contained in the sextant. While the resolution feels somewhat gentle, the intensification of knowledge provides a sufficient turn, and the conceptual cost is clear in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake and executes a meaningful deepening of the conflict when Elara’s own fragmented memory becomes the final barrier. This turn effectively shifts the opposition from external to internal. The resolution is driven by her agency, but the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral, and the cost of her struggle could have been rendered with more palpable consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara’s internal struggle for self-acceptance—is signaled early and remains the focus. The conflict escalates through a deepening of understanding rather than rising external pressure. The climax with the blank book successfully re-weights her perspective, forcing a final stance. The cost is legible as she leaves her safe haven, but the internal tension throughout the story feels more contemplative than fraught.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—finding "tenuous absolution"—is clear but remains largely internal and atmospheric. The conflict against "creeping normality" lacks concrete opposition. The discovery of the plaque functions as a deepening of her conviction, but it feels more like a gift than an earned victory against resistance. The stakes never feel truly at risk, which keeps the tension moderate throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—preserving meaning against oblivion—is established early and meaningfully deepened when the slide transforms Elara’s role. This escalation is driven by her agency in investigating the unique slide. The story effectively builds pressure toward a final stance crystallization where the cost of her new purpose is made clear.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake—the "truce of hush"—is well-defined and personal. The confrontation provides a meaningful tightening of pressure. The primary flaw is that the resolution of this pressure feels slightly unearned. The antagonists' "bravado cracking" after a few lines of dialogue lessens the sense of earned victory, making the stakes feel less dangerous in retrospect. The cost, her becoming a "reluctant guardian," is legible but would land with more force if the preceding threat felt more intractable.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    The primary stake—Elara's quest for self-understanding—is clear and compelling. However, the conflict lacks tangible pressure. The ring's "metallic taste" signals danger that never materializes, deflating tension. The escalation is purely informational, and the final choice is made without facing any significant opposition or immediate, visible cost beyond a conceptual shift in worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant internal stake—authenticity versus fear—is established immediately and deepens effectively. The discovery of the old self-portrait serves as a powerful turn, reweighting the stakes and clarifying the path forward. The cost of her final choice is made legible in the "sorrow of one who has finally faced the truth," earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding the past to save the future—is established early and escalates effectively under a Causal lens. The key tightening occurs when Elara discovers the dishonesty within the lost conversations, forcing a difficult choice between partial comfort and a "bitter," complete truth. Her decision to inscribe the full, painful truth demonstrates agency and carries a visible cost, earning the story's resolution and making the final hope feel substantial.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully dramatizes an abstract stake: preserving wonder against forgetfulness. The pressure deepens through the intensification of the iceberg's light, culminating in a clear climax. The cost is well-defined as the impermanence of the moment, which provides a meaningful resolution. The conflict is primarily internal and atmospheric, which is effective for the chosen textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stakes are signaled early and escalate effectively from an internal problem (static) to an external threat (chaos consuming the farm). Elara's agency drives the plot from the inciting choice to the final action. The resolution is earned, and the cost is made unmistakable in the final paragraphs, satisfying the core demands of conflict and consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central conflict is solving the mystery, but the stakes remain low and largely internal to Clara's curiosity. The escalation is undercut when the solution—the key in the locket—is revealed almost immediately after the problem's stakes are explained. There is no meaningful tightening or trade-off; the protagonist faces no significant opposition or cost in achieving her goal, which deflates the narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—liberating forgotten knowledge—is established early and tested against the environment's decay and silence. The conflict escalates effectively through a single, meaningful deepening: the discovery of the dance-coded journal, which changes the rules of engagement. This turn is driven by Elara’s agency (her choice to interpret and perform the dance), but the stakes feel more conceptual than visceral, slightly muting the final price.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central stake—retrieving lost memories—is clear and compelling. The pressure deepens effectively as the ritual begins and the "pockets of gravity" fluctuate, leading to a decisive climax. The main weakness is the legibility of the cost at resolution. The story ends on a note of pure gain (understanding) without a tangible trade-off or price paid in the moment, making the earned resolution feel less hard-won than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—preventing a chaotic prophecy—is established immediately and remains the focus. The conflict escalates effectively when the prophecy's power begins "thrashing like a trapped animal," providing a clear moment of rising pressure. The resolution is earned through Elara’s agency ("a final surge of will"), and the cost is legible in the fragile balance and the need for future vigilance. The conflict is primarily metaphysical but is dramatized with sufficient force.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake: whether Clara will remain in her safe isolation or embrace a deeper, more connected existence. The conflict escalates effectively under the accumulative lens, as Elias’s revelations steadily deepen the meaning of Clara's world, her heirloom, and her own agency. The final choice to act pays a clear price—the forfeiture of her passive sanctuary—making the resolution feel earned and weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—Elara's skepticism versus the garden's mystery—is established early and tested when she picks up the shell. The pressure deepens effectively during the memory flood. However, the escalation stalls during the confrontation with the figure; it becomes a calm explanation rather than a crucible, and Elara's acceptance is too immediate. The final cost is legible, but the peak conflict lacks the friction needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant internal stake—whether Elara can release her foundational bitterness—is signaled early and tested on the page. The moment of hesitation before using the thorn serves as the story's meaningful deepening, crystallizing the cost of the choice. The resolution is driven by her agency, and the price paid (shedding the armor of grievance) is legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—understanding the echoes to find her purpose—is signaled early and remains the focus. However, the conflict is entirely passive; Elara faces no meaningful opposition or setback. The escalation is minimal, consisting of a walk to a foretold destination. The climactic test, "ensure you are ready," is resolved by a simple declaration with no demonstrated cost or trade-off, making the resolution feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is established early and pursued consistently. The conflict is primarily metaphysical, pitting Elara's method against the obscurity of the past. Pressure deepens effectively as informational fragments accumulate, leading to the emotional climax. The resolution is earned within this quiet framework, though it lacks a sharp reversal or a tangible, unexpected cost.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.5)
    The central conflict is purely intellectual and lacks tangible stakes or escalation. The "pressure" is the abstract desire for understanding, which deepens in intensity but never forces a trade-off or a choice with a visible price. The resolution is an insight arrived at through contemplation, not an earned outcome of overcoming meaningful opposition, which makes the conflict feel static and low-stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—the fate of the orchard and the containment of the entity—is signaled early and resolved with a legible cost. However, the escalation is extremely compressed, rocketing from investigation to climactic confrontation in a few sentences. This rapid, single-step intensification lacks the sustained pressure that would give the final choice its maximum dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    The central stake—whether Elias will redefine humanity's destiny—is established early and escalates effectively toward the climax. The pressure builds through the voice's commands and the intensifying storm, forcing a clear, high-stakes choice. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the cost ("the weight of his journey") is made legible in his final emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story presents a clear dominant stake: capturing the music box’s sound to fulfill Elias's purpose. The conflict escalates beautifully from a mechanical problem (jammed gears) to a conceptual one (his method is insufficient for the memory). The shattering of the jar is a decisive deepening driven by the box's agency, forcing Elias to trade his goal of capture for the deeper experience of reception, a cost that is legible and transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—protecting the key—is established immediately and escalates effectively through a coherent sequence of pressures under a Causal lens. The antagonist's offer provides a meaningful test of the protagonist's resolve. Elara’s final action demonstrates agency, and the resolution comes at the clear cost of ending her isolation with the certainty of a powerful enemy, which recharges the stakes for her ongoing mission.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.2)
    The central conflict—patience versus impatience—is declared but never dramatized. We don't witness Elara struggling against impatience; we are simply told she overcomes it. The stakes feel philosophical rather than personal and immediate. While there is a deepening of understanding, it arrives as a placid realization atop the viaduct, lacking the feeling of a hard-won victory forged through tangible pressure or the foreclosure of a genuinely tempting alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    The stakes are effectively signaled and escalate from a professional investigation to a direct, personal confrontation with a corrupt mentor. The discovery of the photograph provides a strong tightening of pressure that forecloses any path of retreat. The resolution is earned through Elara's agency, and the cost is legible, satisfying the core requirements for a strong conflict structure under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—whether Elias will commit to action on Thomas’s behalf—is established early and sharpens throughout the scene. The pressure is applied philosophically by Alistair, leading to a decisive deepening of Elias's resolve. The cost is made explicit and felt in the final lines: “the storm was coming.” This crystallization of intent and consequence is a powerful form of escalation for an internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—creating the yearning algorithm—is established immediately and pursued with obsessive focus. The escalation is handled beautifully for an accumulative plot, not through external opposition but through the internal pressure of the quest, which deepens until the breakthrough. The climax dramatically raises the stakes from a personal project to a world-altering event, and the cost—unleashing a power beyond her comprehension—is made viscerally clear and drives the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake—solving the cold case—and escalates the pressure effectively. The "Access denied" notification serves as a decisive tightening, forcing Elara to move from a passive investigator to an active risk-taker by lying. The final revelation dramatically raises the stakes from a historical mystery to an ongoing existential threat, making her final choice feel weighty.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.5)
    The central conflict lacks meaningful opposition, making the escalation feel more like a procedural discovery tour than a struggle against mounting pressure. The protagonist’s internal doubts are mentioned but immediately overcome, presenting no real obstacle. The stakes, while conceptually grand ("mend what had been broken"), remain abstract and lack visceral threat, resulting in a resolution that feels predetermined and low-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake is Elara’s internal quest for meaning, which is signaled early and consistently held. The pressure intensifies effectively when the man in the shelter voices her exact obsession ("Do you ever wonder what it sounds like? ... The end."), forcing her to engage rather than merely observe. This serves as the story's meaningful deepening, leading to a resolution where she pays the cost of abandoning her detached, touristic stance for a more engaged, life-affirming one.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant internal stake—finding peace with a past mismatch—is signaled early and coherently developed. The pressure deepens through reflection on the letter and observation of the setting, leading to a decisive internal shift. The escalation is subtle and purely psychological, which fits the tone, and the cost of relinquishing an idealized view of love is clear in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.5)
    This is the story's most significant weakness. While a dominant stake—preserving wisdom before the prophet's arrival—is clearly signaled, it is never genuinely tested. There is no opposition, obstacle, or internal conflict. Elara performs her task flawlessly and is immediately successful, resulting in a complete lack of tension or escalation. The conflict is declared but never dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake is internal—Elara's struggle to process grief and find redemptive meaning. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens effectively as she immerses herself in her work. The resolution, a shift in her emotional state, is earned by her focused action within the scene. The cost of her past loss is clear, but the price paid for this specific day's progress feels subtle, which is appropriate for the story's quiet nature.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—restoring language and meaning to a faded world—is established early and remains the focus. The escalation is subtle yet effective under the Accumulative lens, shifting from deciphering chaos to realizing the pattern's existence. The primary tightening is excellent: the discovery that decoding the pattern will destroy the crystal introduces a direct cost, forcing a trade-off that makes the victory bittersweet and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story holds a single, poignant internal stake with impressive discipline. The pressure deepens atmospherically, consistent with the Accumulative lens, as Elias's search becomes more focused. The final beat provides a clear resolution where the cost is visible and felt: he relinquishes his tool (the chalk) and his goal of "capturing," a renunciation that is earned by the quiet intensity of his journey and gives the ending its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.5)
    The central conflict is clear: order versus chaos, control versus acceptance. The stake—Elara's desire to harness the ephemeral—is well-defined. The narrative deepens effectively when her approach shifts from repair to reinvention. However, the escalation feels more intellectual than visceral; the pressure is abstract and the resolution is achieved through a sudden stroke of genius rather than a costly trade-off or overcoming a tangible obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—reunification before death—is signaled clearly and the time pressure is established. However, the story lacks meaningful escalation or conflict. Obstacles are either absent or resolved with near-instantaneous ease; the "tension of years apart" is mentioned but never dramatized as a genuine barrier to the flawless resolution Elara executes. The lack of any on-page friction makes the earnedness of the final peace feel slight.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.2)
    While large-scale stakes ("unravel the very fabric of reality") are declared, the on-page conflict lacks commensurate pressure. The escalation is minimal; Elara faces an intellectual puzzle, not a dynamic opposition. The resolution is achieved through competent execution rather than a difficult choice, and the "cost" of the dormant key feels like an outcome, not a price she had to weigh.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—mending past mistakes and finding redemption—is established early and tested effectively. The conflict tightens decisively when the woman demands a price, forcing a trade-off between healing and Elara's core trait of "certainty." The cost is made tangible through the sacrifice of the stone, and the resolution is earned directly through this choice, demonstrating clear protagonist agency under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story establishes a clear and compelling internal stake: to create light and heal from trauma. The conflict escalates effectively under the accumulative lens, with the thickening mist and deepening memories serving as a meaningful intensification of pressure. The resolution is earned through Lira's agency in her craft, and the cost—the emotional weight of her past—is felt throughout, culminating in her peaceful departure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story excels at deepening its central stake—the protection of vulnerability—under an Accumulative lens. Kai’s arrival doesn't escalate conflict through action, but intensifies the internal pressure on Elara. Her agency is quiet but decisive, and the cost of letting him in is legible in her hesitation and reliance on the pendant, making the final turn feel both risky and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story's dominant internal conflict deepens effectively, escalating the emotional stakes as Elara ventures further into the nexus. Her final choice is driven by her own agency in response to this pressure, and the cost—accepting the burden of memory—is clear and earned within the story's accumulative logic.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—healing the village—is established early, but the conflict lacks significant escalation. The pressure of the timeframe is stated ("the timeframe was crucial") but not dramatized; there is no setback, failed attempt, or rising obstacle. The progression is a smooth intensification of success rather than a tightening of options, making the final resolution feel less like a victory wrested from conflict and more like an inevitable unfolding.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—successfully creating the map—is clear and maintained throughout. The escalation follows the procedural steps of the ritual, which functions as a form of deepening pressure. However, the conflict lacks a significant external or internal obstacle; the "faint tremor" acts more as a response than a threat, and failure never feels like a genuine possibility, which slightly mutes the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.0)
    The central stake—capturing wonder before it's lost—is compelling and established early. The conflict is primarily a quiet, internal puzzle against time. The pressure escalates effectively through the sustained effort ("Days turned into nights"), culminating in a single, decisive breakthrough. While the escalation is subtle, it's perfectly suited to the story's meditative tone and the textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—Elara’s purpose—and effectively deepens the conflict with the figure's pointed questions. The line "Purpose can be a trap" forces a re-evaluation, leading to a decisive choice. The cost is legible in the "fissure" in her soul, representing the loss of her former identity, which is a sufficient price for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    The internal conflict is rendered with subtlety and depth. The primary stake—whether Elara can shape meaning from loss—is clear and personal. The escalation point, the struggle with the lion's complex mane, serves as a perfect external mirror for her internal state, and her decision to apply her husband's philosophy to her grief is a moment of clear, earned agency with a visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—negotiating with regret—and effectively deepens it when the camera wheel reveals a personal, urgent message. This discovery provides a meaningful tightening of the conflict, shifting Mara from aimless scavenging to a guided quest. The final resolution, where she accepts her "ghost," is an earned stance crystallization with a clear emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=3.5)
    This is the story's critical failure. The central conflict is purely conceptual and lacks any tangible pressure or escalation. Eli faces no obstacles, setbacks, or difficult trade-offs in his project to "resurrect" the terminal. Without a credible struggle, the final achievement, while thematically resonant, feels unearned and dramatically inert.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The central stake—reconciling with an abandoned dream—is signaled early and consistently held. The pressure deepens effectively when the whispers shift, forcing a confrontation that moves from passive longing to active choice. The resolution is driven by Elara's agency in finishing the clock, and the cost of foreclosing the path of literal travel is clear and poignant.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—to understand past deceptions—is established early. The story executes one meaningful deepening when Elara commits to salvaging the specific barge, a choice that leads to the discovery. The cost is felt emotionally through the weight of the captain's confession. However, the pressure feels more atmospheric than tactical; the conflict lacks a tangible opposition or a trade-off that forces a difficult choice, reading more like a successful, linear search operation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving ancient knowledge—is clear, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation. The central challenge, a complex knot, is overcome not by a difficult choice or clever tactic, but by a passive moment of intuition ("she closed her eyes, letting her mind drift"). Pressure remains atmospheric rather than causal; there is no point where failure seems like a genuine possibility or where Elara must sacrifice something to succeed, making the final victory feel slight.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    The conflict is internal and subtle, fitting the story's tone, and escalates effectively under an accumulative lens. The dominant stake—achieving a moment of healing and understanding—is clear. The pressure deepens with the woman’s confession, leading to the traveler’s decisive action of writing the obituary. The cost is made tangible through the woman's tears and the poignant finality of her giving away a treasured memento, a price that feels both earned and significant.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—reawakening beauty—is established early and effectively deepened when Kael discovers the machine parts, forcing a choice that tests his core values. This tightening is driven by his agency in deciding to assemble the machine. The resolution avoids a simple victory, instead escalating the stakes by revealing the true cost and complexity of his goal, which is a sophisticated and earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—Elara’s need for a new form of redemption—and deepens it through the single, decisive act of grafting. Under the Accumulative lens, the rising atmospheric tension and focused internal resolve serve as effective escalation. The cost is legible in the final beat: she accepts the uncertainty of the outcome in exchange for internal peace.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding the box and liberating memories—is clear and deepens effectively. Pressure escalates as the box syncs with Elara's heartbeat, connecting the external quest to her internal state. The final choice to place the shard is an act of agency that resolves the conflict with a clear, felt cost (shedding her skepticism). While the escalation is more of a steady accumulation than a series of sharp turns, it is coherent and sufficient for this narrative form.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—sharing light without fire—is established immediately. The conflict escalates effectively under an accumulative lens as the "sonar pinging" deepens Elara's connection and intensifies the light. The resolution is earned by her agency, but the stakes remain conceptual. The lack of a tangible, immediate price paid makes the conflict feel more like a serene philosophical problem than a high-stakes struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake—how to artistically represent an impossible weight of grief—is established early and intensifies effectively. The pressure is coherent, culminating in a deepening of understanding rather than a physical confrontation. The final choice to carve the ribbon's pattern represents a clear shift in tactics with a legible cost: accepting that grief is a process to be honored, not a problem to be solved.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—Elias's search for absolution and balance—is clear, but the conflict lacks texture and resistance. The escalation is a conceptual deepening, which fits the textural lens, but the resolution is too smooth. The town's resentments are resolved off-page through summarized conversations, which deflates the tension and makes the restoration of balance feel frictionless and low-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story establishes a clear internal stake—understanding the past—but fails to generate any meaningful escalation or pressure. The central task of untangling the tapestry is presented without obstacle, doubt, or risk of failure; Elias's focus "never wavered." The chess clock is a missed opportunity for tension, becoming a passive detail noted only after it has run down instead of a device that forces a choice or alters tactics. The conflict is entirely static.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake is established early, but the conflict lacks meaningful escalation. The central challenge—inspiring a stagnant people—is resolved in a single, swift beat by a magical object without any significant setback, tactical adaptation, or cost to the protagonist. The pressure dissipates as soon as the quill begins to write, making the resolution feel convenient rather than earned through struggle against coherent opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost stories in a world starved of them—is established early and provides a strong foundation for the narrative. The conflict escalates effectively through a single, sustained deepening of mystery rather than multiple reversals, which is appropriate for this length and lens. The final resolve carries a clear, if subtle, cost: trading the safety of her methodical work for the uncertainty of the pirate broadcast's mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story establishes a clear internal/ritualistic stake: to properly honor the deceased by crystallizing a fleeting moment. The pressure deepens texturally rather than causally, culminating in the performance of the ritual. The protagonist's agency is evident in her deliberate actions, and the cost is legible in the final paragraph's poignant acceptance of ultimate impermanence. While the conflict is quiet, it is coherent and well-matched to the story's accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    The central stake—whether Kael will remain in the past or engage with the future—is clear and is effectively tightened by Lira's news of the collapse. This forces an active, high-stakes choice. The resolution is weak, however, as the conflict dissolves into a simple synthesis rather than a choice with a paid and felt cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving the vanishing arts against societal indifference—is established early and remains the core focus. The conflict is largely atmospheric and internal. The story executes one meaningful deepening when Elara's experiment succeeds, transforming the choir's potential. The resolution feels earned within the story's quiet, accumulative framework, though the external antagonistic force ("indifference") remains an abstract concept rather than an applied pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    The primary conflict is internal doubt, which is established but resolved without sufficient pressure or a tangible price. The stakes are large but abstract ("rebellion against indifference"), and the resolution comes too cleanly. The fruit works perfectly, erasing any sense of risk and delivering a victory without a visible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth behind the blackout—is clear. However, the conflict lacks significant pressure or opposing force; Elara faces a puzzle, not an antagonist or a meaningful risk of failure. The escalation is a simple progression of discovery rather than a true tightening of stakes, and the resolution feels preordained once the key is found, undercutting the tension of the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The central stake—Elias's quest for understanding—is philosophical but consistently held. Pressure builds not through external opposition but through an internal, accumulative process, fitting the chosen lens perfectly; the collection of objects creates a "quiet intensity" that forces his ritualistic action. The resulting change in knowledge is a decisive deepening, and the cost of his new purpose is legible, making the conflict's resolution feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—saving Elara's village versus the risk of a flawed solution—is established immediately. The conflict tightens decisively when Liora’s warning introduces a new, unforeseen complication. This escalation is driven by character agency and forces Elara to pay a tangible internal cost: her "certainty fracturing like the garden’s ancient stones."

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake is well-defined and pressure escalates effectively through atmosphere and the geometry shift. The pivotal turn—losing the die—forces a renunciation of her initial goal. The cost is concrete and deeply felt, foreclosing her past approach and compelling the final, earned shift in perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story effectively deepens its stakes from a personal, internal conflict (insomnia) to a vast, mystical one (recovering a lost culture). The key tightening occurs when Elara realizes she is "remembering," which shifts her from a passive artist to an active channel. The cost is clear: her former life and its simpler anxieties are foreclosed in favor of a new, demanding purpose, which is earned by her actions within the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the central stake—rescuing a dying tradition—is established early, the story lacks meaningful conflict or escalation. Elara faces no opposition, setbacks, or difficult trade-offs; her plan works exactly as intended. The pressure is entirely internal and static, and the resolution arrives without a climactic test of her commitment, making the earned victory feel hollow and frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    The central stake—rewriting destiny—is established early and tested directly. The story achieves a single, meaningful escalation as the stone activates and the lighthouse shudders, driven entirely by the protagonist's agency. The cost of success is made palpable in the final paragraph through Elias's unease and the sheer uncertainty of the new reality he has created. The pressure is coherent, the climax is earned, and the consequences are immediate and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The central psychological stake—freedom from fear—is established early and escalated effectively. The pressure tightens when Clara re-evaluates the cursed clasp as a tool, a choice that narrows her options toward direct confrontation. Her final act of unbosoming is a clear exercise of agency that resolves the conflict with a legible cost, making the climax feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—resolving an inner and atmospheric dissonance—is signaled early and provides a clear goal. However, the conflict remains abstract and lacks tangible opposition or a sense of what might be lost. The resolution arrives without a significant struggle, and since the cost of Leeward's action is negligible, the tension never rises to a truly compelling level.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake (the mystery of the gate) is signaled early and escalates dramatically, shifting from a personal quest to the survival of a civilization. This deepening is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency and choices. The cost of her discovery—the immense burden of a new, more dangerous quest—is unmistakable and charges the final paragraph with significant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—finding the archive—is clear, but the conflict remains low-pressure throughout. Elara faces environmental decay and a simple riddle, but no active opposition, time constraint, or difficult trade-off. The escalation is a single, easily surmounted intellectual hurdle, and the resolution comes without a tangible cost, weakening the overall tension.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—honoring the "drowned dreams"—is established early and pursued consistently. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure effectively deepens with the discovery of the journal, shifting the conflict from a professional challenge to a moral one. The resolution is earned by Elias's agency, and the cost is legible in the transformation of his professional identity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—uncovering the truth—is established early and drives the narrative. Pressure escalates effectively through the discovery of anomalies and the realization that the blackout is ending, creating a clear time constraint. The protagonist’s agency drives the resolution. However, the conflict lacks a palpable sense of loss or trade-off; the final victory feels complete, without a resonant, felt price being paid on the page to achieve it.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake—Kael's struggle against being consumed by grief—is established immediately and remains the focus. Lira's intervention provides a meaningful escalation, forcing Kael to abandon his failing strategy and take a new, higher-stakes action. The final choice to unfold the crane is an act of agency with a legible emotional cost, earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant internal stake—finding purpose after trauma—is established immediately. Pressure escalates through Zara's focused investigation, leading to a deepening of understanding when she realizes the geodes' potential lies within. This discovery reweights her options, shifting her from passive survivor to active seeker. The cost is the "bleak exhilaration" of her new, undefined path, which is legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.5)
    The dominant stake—finding the chip pieces—is clear, but the conflict lacks meaningful pressure. Kael faces no significant opposition, obstacles, or trade-offs; the drone and clues work perfectly on the first try. The story lacks a meaningful tightening of stakes, making the journey feel procedural and low-risk until the final internal shift, which itself is not precipitated by any on-page struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story establishes a clear, potent internal stake—Elias’s moral salvation—and effectively escalates the pressure through the symbolic journey to the shore. The climax delivers a decisive deepening of his self-knowledge, forcing a renunciation of his old ways. The cost is made tangible in the final paragraphs as he accepts the permanent "weight of the withheld truth," making the resolution feel earned and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—unthering the kingdoms from mistrust—is established immediately. The conflict deepens effectively when Kael challenges Elara's premise ("neutrality is a luxury"), forcing her to reframe the core concept. This verbal parry serves as the story's central turn, raising the intellectual and emotional stakes and leading directly to the costly resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—Mara's internal struggle to find a new way forward—is clear and consistently held. The pressure builds through accumulated reflection, leading to a meaningful tightening when she acts on her newfound perspective by launching the kayak. The cost is legible in her symbolic act of tucking the compass away, representing a renunciation of her former self, which is an effective and sufficient escalation for this lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant internal stake is clear, and the conflict deepens when Elias drops the baseball, forcing a choice that moves him from observer to participant. This decision to enter the lake provides a meaningful escalation of his engagement with his own problem. The final cost—accepting his past rather than erasing it—is legible and directly tied to the scene's central action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake is clear and is effectively deepened by the guardian's re-framing of the conflict. However, the pressure remains low throughout. The guardian functions more as a wise mentor than an obstacle, resulting in a conflict that feels more like a gentle corrective lesson than a high-stakes confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The internal stake—reconciling with lost time—is established immediately and remains the clear focus. The story escalates pressure effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, with each symbolic element (cards, saucer) deepening the protagonist's emotional crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the stakes—humanity's extinction—are immense, the on-page conflict is negligible. There is no meaningful escalation of pressure; Elara's actions are met with affirmation rather than resistance. The central conflict of "shadow work" is resolved through summary and a simple, unopposed action ("stitch the air"). The lack of a genuine test or a tangible trade-off at the climax makes the protagonist's success feel inevitable rather than hard-won.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant internal stake—to understand transformation—is signaled early and tested by the story's central choice. The pressure of the "whispering hush" provides a coherent escalating force consistent with the textural lens, leading to a climactic decision with a visible cost. The conflict feels somewhat low-pressure, as Elara's internal resistance to the detour is minimal, making the turn feel less like a struggle and more like a guided tour.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story establishes a clear dominant stake early on and escalates the pressure effectively through a meaningful tightening: the arrival of Captain Thorne.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story signals its core internal stake early—censorship versus truth—and escalates it effectively through a single, powerful tightening: the choice to open the envelope. This action, driven by protagonist agency, forecloses the path of continued silence. The cost, a necessary return to the past, is made explicit and charges the resolution with consequential weight.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    The conflict is well-defined as a philosophical duel with clear stakes: the nature of truth and the path to knowledge. The tension escalates through a logical progression of arguments, culminating in a key tightening when Elias forces Mara to define her terms ("what do they interpret?"). The resolution is earned through this escalation, with the final cost being the forfeiture of the original goal for a higher understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—forging beauty from anarchy—is clear but remains largely abstract. The conflict lacks immediate, tangible opposition; the rebuilding effort is presented without obstacles or setbacks. Pressure is atmospheric and internal. The story achieves a thematic deepening, but the absence of a concrete test or reversal for the characters' commitment keeps the tension from escalating in a visceral way.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)

Pressure coheres via storm and timer, with one meaningful cadence shift narrowing options toward uncensored writing; cost is felt in emotional dissolution and conceptual repricing of purpose. Agency in breaking seal and writing forecloses censored path with visible trade-off, though coincidence of envelope arrival complicates without resolving. No multiple reversals needed, but tightening feels somewhat internal without sharper external test.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake of uncovering the hidden overture signals early and deepens through dialogue probes, with one meaningful tightening when Elias presses on angles' interpretations, narrowing options under Accumulative/Textural pressure; agency via renunciation forecloses paths with conceptual cost. Coherent pressure forces stance crystallization, but stakes remain somewhat abstract without visceral escalation. Moral calculus sharpens the choice between interpretation and truth.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake of forging beauty from anarchy tightens once through the letters' discovery, deepening hope with a conceptual cost in Elias's permanence, but pressure remains static without a clear reversal or agency-driven escalation under the textural lens. The rooftop reflection crystallizes stance, yet stakes feel abstract rather than viscerally tested on-page. Coincidence in meeting Clara complicates without resolving, but overall conflict loops repetitively without meaningful progression.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake of overcoming loss signals early and deepens through the film reel's memory immersion, forcing stance crystallization with a felt cost in accepting unchangeable fate. Under Accumulative lens, pattern break in the kaleidoscope colors reweights options, but escalation feels somewhat passive without a sharper on-page reversal. Coincidence of finding the reel complicates without resolving.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake of protecting collective memory is signaled early and tightens once at the guardian riddle, narrowing options via the truth-fantasy question under Causal escalation. Agency manifests in Elara's answer and planting, foreclosing drift with a visible burden cost, but pressure feels static without interwoven internal-external conflicts or a credible loss altering tactics. Coincidence in dream guidance complicates without resolving, yet the monsoon timeframe forces stance crystallization adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake of finding the color of unspoken apologies tightens through one meaningful deepening as the lace whispers instructions, narrowing options to follow the tides under Accumulative/Textural lens, with felt cost in confronting regrets via the letters. Pressure coheres via accumulating memories, forcing stance crystallization at the shore without coincidence resolving. Agency in renunciation is clear, with moral calculus between holding and releasing sorrow. Strength in the cove climax where cost is legible, but escalation is single-note, sufficient yet not exceptional for higher band.


== Grader: Kimi K2 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncovering what matters after loss—tightens as patterns evolve. Pressure grows via observation and incremental growth, not reversal. Cost is conceptual (awe, humility) rather than tangible, but remains legible in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translating silence into music—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation occurs via pattern discovery that narrows options from “restore sound” to “inhabit silence.” The tightening is driven by Elara’s agency and carries the cost of abandoning her former identity as musician.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rest for the restless—tightens when Elias realizes the lens must be completed to send the city’s final signal. One meaningful deepening: each fragment found increases the moral weight. Cost is felt in bodily fatigue and the irreversible release of the city’s soul.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—community survival under sanctions—declared early. Tightening occurs when anonymity begins to fray, forcing Mara to trade invisibility for social cohesion; cost is the deliberate public exposure that ends future covert runs. No coincidence resolves anything.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“find where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and tightened when the pendant’s glow forces a choice. Agency is present (kneel, lift, place), but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; no tangible forfeiture beyond “memories no longer weighed on her.”

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost ancestral memory—is signaled early and tightened when the fragment warms and the maze warps. The single decisive turn is placing the fragment on the pedestal; cost is the fragment’s dissolution and the maze’s spent power. Pressure escalates via sensory intensification rather than external opposition, fitting the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—seeds equal future survival—signaled early; wall-collapse clock supplies coherent pressure intensifying mid-escape beat. Escalation is single-torque rather than deepening: men close in, ladder snag, run, chains release. Cost is conceptual (personal labor henceforth) more than viscerally felt in breath or wound.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—recovering the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and tightened when the forge’s ache reconfigures it from pursuit to acceptance. Pressure escalates via Accumulative density: each harvested absence narrows the emotional field until the final resonance. Cost is felt in the “resonant ache” but not yet paid in action.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—claiming or releasing the jar—tightens once when the flower-code warns of danger, then again when Elara reveals the soul-cost. Agency drives the final acceptance; price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—completing the endless-night map—escalates as each summarized silence adds contour, tightening under the Accumulative lens. Yet the cost is diffuse; no single beat shows the oracle forfeiting a concrete alternative path.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—origin of thought—is signaled early and tightened through each looped memory; the violin’s music forces a single decisive intensification. Agency is interior (attention shift) with conceptual cost, satisfying the 600-word escalation bar. No external antagonist needed.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—thaw mistrust via transparency—is signaled early and tightened once when Elara commits to the doodle-bridge. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory echo (crystals, ticket, lens) increases the cost of withholding. The final reconfiguration forecloses guarded silence; the price is the vulnerability both now share.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—proving mutual recognition between gardener and garden—is signaled early and tightens through daily ritual; each polished marble narrows tomorrow’s options. The cost is conceptual (acceptance of cracks) rather than a tangible forfeiture, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove temporal shift—escalates to physical jeopardy when nexus overload threatens station integrity. One decisive tightening after she pulls the lever: either contain the energy and accept partial proof with institutional threat, or lose everything. Agency drives the course, coincidences absent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode the ghost’s unfinished composition—escalates once (from deciphering to actually auditioning the melody out loud).  The cost is quiet but legible: Clara exchanges her silence-habit for the vulnerability of singing, watching the program melt away as payment.  One tightening is sufficient for the slice length and the pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Swaying-certainties concept drives tone and shaken epistemology; however, it escalates internally rather than tightening external options. Growth accumulates to the botanical distortion but never changes Elara’s tactics—score stays in high mid-tiers.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—freeing the ghosts to lay her father’s truth to rest—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when whispers become screams, forcing the turn of the wheel. Cost is implied (fear, cold, shadows lunging) but not made viscerally irreversible; the ghosts’ relief is external rather than a personal forfeiture. One meaningful escalation beat is present.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—witnessing without judgment versus surrendering to transformative silence—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when the swan reveals the map, forcing the choice to enter the refuge. Cost is conceptual (loss of prior self) but not viscerally staged.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—rekindling wonder in Finn—is signaled early and tightened once when the curl glows. Cost is soft (emotional shift, no tangible loss), but visible in Finn’s dropped telescope. Escalation is a single deepening under Accumulative lens; sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—restore the world’s dreams—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: discovery of scrolls → ritual. However, the tightening is informational, not experiential; no live option is foreclosed, no visible cost exacted. Agency is present but frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—unraveling hidden life—signaled early. Pressure tightens only narratively (“journey began”) rather than through an on-page beat that forecloses an option or exacts a visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—prevent cosmic possession—is declared early. Escalation is tonal (muffled → sharpened clarity) rather than causal; the priest’s questions tighten the conceptual noose. Agency is intellectual; no tangible price is paid, so pressure feels abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—transmuting memory into unheard symphony—is signaled early. Pressure tightens via dawn’s deadline and exhaustion, forcing the final act. Cost is felt in collapse, but escalation is more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—embracing rather than conquering the fractured self—escalates through each timeline shard; the final crystallization narrows her options from mastery to acceptance, but the price is more epiphanic than materially paid.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—defeat emotional numbness—is signaled in para 2; pressure escalates from scepticism through painstaking reversal work to final cost trade-off. Reversal itself constitutes the meaningful tightening: no external coincidence; the backward music narrows options emotionally. Agency: Elara renounces numbness (final beat) rather than solves an external puzzle. Cost is embodied (raw tears) and irreversible. No secondary antagonist required at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.5)
    The dominant stake—“something’s been released”—is declared late and never materializes as an on-page threat; tension derives from sneaking, not from the storm-borne contagion. One tightening beat occurs when Elias decides to enter the zone, yet the price (solitude breached) is summarized, not dramatized. Agency is present but undercut by coincidence: guards’ patterns are intuited rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—will Elias face the memory encoded in scent?—is signaled early and tightens once when he uncorks the vial. Agency drives the final act; cost is the surrender of his aromatic shield. Pressure is coherent but single-turn; no deepening complication beyond the memory sequence itself.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    The dominant stake – “discover the texture of time” – escalates by incremental revelation: each pattern read, each mirror image narrows futures until only remaining choice is to keep writing the poem as time’s texture. Cost feels visceral in the rope-drop.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—filling the hush with meaning—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the bowl’s weight forces her from playing to speaking. Cost is conceptual (bearing memories) rather than visceral; still, agency drives the turn. Coincidence absent; escalation coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—deliver joy without attachment—tightens when Elara realizes Kael’s half-truth fear. The decisive deepening is her choice to weave transience into the emotion, narrowing her own ethical path. Cost is felt in the “ache” and the empty pouch. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no external reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    The dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—remains thematic rather than viscerally tested; no concrete loss or trade-off is dramatized. Pressure escalates only through exchanged letters, a low-stakes accretion. The final meeting resolves tension via coincidence (shared grandmother photo) rather than protagonist agency with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (belonging) is signaled early and tightens through each Echo fragment; the communal web frays then re-knits around Lira’s search, but the decisive tightening beat is narrated rather than enacted, muting the price.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—recover lost creative cadence—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the gate opens and the giant’s nap nears its end. Agency is present (she descends, dips her hand) but the cost of leaving is narrated rather than felt, capping escalation just below the 7.0 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the mathematics of emotion to heal ambiguous loss—is signaled early and tightened when the mentor’s warning raises the price. One clear escalation: the journal’s final entry forces Elara to decide whether to risk the same fate.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    One dominant stake—visibility through restored memory—is signaled early and tightens as fragments accumulate. The pressure is textural rather than causal; no single choice narrows options. The final hum reweights the stake with conceptual cost, but the lack of a visible trade-off keeps it from the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—control vs. surrender—is signaled early and tightens through storm pressure and leaf pulse. One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses the leaf to her chest, foreclosing the old stance. Cost is visible in the drenching and the dissolved leaf.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s search for meaning—tightens when the map labels “Exchange” and the old woman demands the brooch. One clear escalation: possession of relic → surrender of relic for stories. Cost is the forfeiture itself, though the emotional weight could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to understand her failed clairvoyance—tightens when the cave demands she surrender prediction altogether. The steadily unpredictable melody externalizes her internal conflict and forces a single irrevocable choice: inhabit the unknown or retreat. Cost is visible: she loses her former self-definition. Escalation is one-note but sufficient for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—compile fragments into meaning—is signaled early and tightens when the carved wood links to the lost ship. The trumpet’s second note is the decisive escalation that forecloses Elara’s outsider stance. Cost is felt in the keeper’s abdication and Elara’s solitary acceptance, though the price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—bridging skepticism and wonder—is signaled early and tightened at the tower when the tile projects memories. Agency is present: Elara chooses to transcribe, paying the cost of her former certainty. Pressure escalates via tile glow and rising melody. No external antagonist; internal conflict suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—an immortal’s craving for authentic feeling—is signaled early and tightened by the fragment’s gamble. The decision to keep pushing magnetic manipulation as colors twist is an irreversible risk. Cost is articulated on-page: ruptured dimensions, Escondite shudder. No second reversal needed; escalation peaks once with visible aftermath.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—stay vs flee honestly—tightens once when Clara breaches the lie. Escalation is causal: the ink pot’s pulse raises the cost of silence, forcing her stance. The price is the father’s visible disappointment and their uncertain future. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve invented histories—intensifies as the hum swells, forcing a single, deeper listening stance. The tightening is atmospheric, not tactical; no option is visibly foreclosed, though the forest’s gift reconfigures her future work.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reclaim erased histories—signaled early. Pressure deepens via archive find; letter tightens emotional cost. No reversal, but meaningful intensification under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (burden of guardianship) rather than tangible, yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—decode riddle vs. accept impermanence—escalates one decisive tightening when cello note and shell light foreclose pursuit of concrete answer.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—community survival vs. privatization—tightens through graffiti trail and festival rally; Vorin’s opposition supplies coherent pressure. One decisive intensification suffices, though cost is more collective than personal.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserve the site before terraforming—tightens once when the timed message forces her to choose between safety and legacy. The pressure is coherent, but the escalation is single-note; no new complication arises after the message is read.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—restore device and shared trust—drives Elara to choose a painstaking micro-overhaul rather than a quick swap. Escalation is one soft tightening: crowd cheers ratchet external pressure during the final tuning; no catastrophic reversal, stakes remain moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—restore balance—is signaled early. Escalation is accretive: each day’s footsteps thicken the texture until the bell rings. No visible price is paid; the town revives without Elias forfeiting anything. One meaningful tightening occurs when the bell sounds.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    The core stake (escape alive vs. grasp transcendent knowledge) is signaled early and narrows to one climactic choice; however, the trade-off is emotionally defaulted rather than viscerally priced. Escalation is present but gentle; pressure tightens more conceptually than kinesthetically.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (free truth vs. vanishing bodies) is coherent and tightens neatly; “bodies as offerings” reversal narrows choice at climax, cost is on-page. One additional tangible consequence of choosing truth over silence would lock 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—repay lifetime debt—is clear; pressure tightens when collective spirits intrude, forcing a stance shift. Cost is implied rather than viscerally shown, keeping it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—restore desolation to reverence—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through each sewn image, but no single beat narrows options or exacts a visible price. The tightening is tonal rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—recovering lost tradition to restore faith—is signaled early and tightens once when the tomb entrance is revealed. However, the escalation is driven more by setting than by protagonist choice, and the cost of opening the tomb is not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—decode margin-messages before mailing—signal early and escalate via coordinates in chalk → letter deadline → dawn arrival with felt cost (sunrise). One tightening via mailbox retrieval under clock pressure is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the observatory’s cosmic gateway—surfaces early and tightens when Lira reveals the plot to extinguish the flame. Escalation is one deepening: from solitary listening to collaborative synchronization, with the cost of lost anonymity and assumed danger. Agency is clear; coincidence is absent. The price (perpetual vigilance) is implied more than dramatized, capping the band.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—healing the unspoken apology—is signaled in paragraph two and escalates through each beat. The moment of breaking the seal is a decisive tightening that forecloses avoidance. Cost is felt in the shard’s loss of glow and the spirits’ silence. Agency is hers; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—the decoded promise to save the reef—intensifies with every smeared character she unknots. No coincidence resolves; final walk-out is her agency. Escalation is one steady tightening: each revealed line raises the moral cost of abandoning or fulfilling the vow.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost joy in art—is signaled early and tightened when the projected memories force a choice: retreat or paint the fog. The single meaningful intensification works, but the cost is more conceptual than visceral; no tangible sacrifice (time, pigment, physical risk) is dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (awaken garden vs. keep certainty) is signaled early and tightened once: Elara’s hum forecloses her prior methodical stance. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting unfettered thought—is signaled early and tightened when the Tax Collectors’ infiltration is revealed. The seed’s warning escalates stakes from quiet deciphering to imminent crackdown. Cost is declared (“we’re being hunted”) but not yet viscerally paid on the page; still, the narrowing of options is clear. One meaningful tightening achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—turning sleepless ache into lasting art—is declared early but never sharpened by risk or resource loss. Pressure is lyrical, not causal; no beat narrows options or exacts a price. The “blossom armistice” remains thematic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened when the Vessel’s glow demands a song that will cost the chime. One meaningful intensification suffices; agency is Elara’s decision to sing, foreclosing her detachment. Cost (shattered chime, embodied regret) is visible, though the escalation beat is singular rather than iterative.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust—is signaled early and tightened by the inkwell’s demand for three promises. Each promise raises the cost of failure; the final glow forecloses retreat. Agency is hers; coincidence never rescues.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—protect village vs. preserve knowledge—is signaled early and tightened when Elias realizes the blueprint must serve both. The decisive turn is his choice to encrypt compassion into the floodgate design, narrowing options from destroy vs. study to controlled access. Cost is visible in the villagers’ sigh of relief and scholars’ nod, a social compromise. Pressure escalates cleanly under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover lost songs—tightens through accumulating texture: dust becomes map, pigeons become carriers of melody. One meaningful deepening: the realization that “the songs are in the dust” reweights all prior mapping. Cost is conceptual (exposure of her false histories) yet remains slightly abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—why some thresholds are sacred—tightens once when memory reveals the father’s dictum and Elara chooses renunciation. Cost is felt in the relinquished logbook, though pressure could have sharpened earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“rhythm of belonging”—is signaled early and tightens when the fireflies’ pulse syncs with her heartbeat, forcing the choice to dance one last time before fleeing. The cost is felt: the domes are failing, time is shrinking, and her endurance of that risk crystallizes stance. Escalation is single but sufficient under Accumulative lens; alarms complicate rather than resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering the grandmother’s path—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each failed grasp intensifies the emotional cost until the final acceptance. Agency is present but soft; the tightening is more cadence than choice, yet the price (perpetual re-finding) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“transform randomness into art”—is declared but never truly tested; no obstacle or price emerges. Escalation is atmospheric, not causal: the crowd’s gasp and starlight deepen texture but do not narrow Elias’s options. No reversal or trade-off occurs; the performance ends exactly as planned. Agency remains performative rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—preserving forbidden memory—tightens when footsteps approach; Lira’s choice to stand tall narrows options and carries implicit cost (future erasure). Pressure escalates via sensory density, not causal chain, fitting Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“before everything shifts, illuminate the mundane”—is signaled early; pressure tightens as the mist clears and the atrium’s silence demands a response. The escalation is textural (density of light and silence) rather than causal, but it reweights the stake effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—transforming guilt into connective purpose—tightens once when the feather visions force a re-evaluation; the cost is the relinquishing of the box, but the beat is more conceptual than visceral, capping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—can iterative beauty outrun erasure?—tightens with each incoming wave; the cost is the acceptance of impermanence. Agency is present in her rhythmic re-creation, though external pressure (tide) is more situational than antagonistic.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes—“learn what walls dream”—stay singular; tightening occurs when discovery narrows from mapping to memorializing. Price is the forfeiture of lifelong quest tool (film) on the pedestal, legible on page, though causal pressure from walls remains lightly external, lowering top-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—mirrors’ surrender—signaled early. Escalation is textural: each sung note tightens the weave until the final cadence shift (“as the bells began to toll”) forces surrender. Cost is visible: fainter heartbeat alters her future options. Agency remains hers; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“end the cycle of violence”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara’s voice breaks, forcing leaders to confront forgiveness as currency. One clear deepening suffices; cost is felt in her exhaustion, though not yet paid in irrevocable loss.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore an extinct species—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is one deepening: discovery of the damp hollow forces the irreversible release. Cost is legible—she risks exposure of her crimes. No external antagonist; pressure is internal guilt and environmental scarcity. Coincidence (rain starting just then) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—defy conformity via the harvest—is signaled early and tightened by each untangled thread; the final dance crystallizes the cost as the city stirs. One meaningful escalation suffices under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake: whether Elias’s storytelling ethics have crossed into manipulation. Pressure tightens once when he questions his purpose, but the escalation is reflective, not external. Agency is present in the decision to reverse method, yet the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized. Coincidence absent.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—honoring vanishing monarch histories—signaled early; pressure deepens through scarcity of butterflies. No external antagonist; escalation is accumulative density of absence. Final image forecloses further building for now, with visible cost of leaving the fragile signal behind.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and tightened through the rope reconfiguration; the cost is the emotional exposure of hearing one’s own lost name. One meaningful deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“why paths choose walkers”—is signaled early and tightens as the storm’s pressure mirrors Foresight’s urgency. One meaningful deepening occurs when the directive is revealed as map, not code, narrowing options. Cost is conceptual (loss of certainty) rather than visceral, slightly blunting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes (“seal a covenant with the unknown”) are declared early but never tested or escalated; the tile’s discovery resolves the quest without forcing a trade-off or visible loss. Pressure stays flat under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—will Kael release resentment?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once via the memory retrieval, but escalation is gentle; no tangible loss or irreversible trade-off is dramatized. The cost is emotional, not visible on the page, keeping it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—dissolve boundaries to reach the dream world—is signaled early and tested once at climax. Escalation is a single tightening: fog thins as sextant aligns. Cost is conceptual (loss of safe ruin) rather than visceral; no tangible forfeiture shown. Agency rests entirely with Elara; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—renewing the deciduous vow—tightens when Elara realizes the breach may be necessary shedding. One clear turn: she stops trying to restore the old contract and instead “transforms” it, paying with the ribbon’s permanent loss.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—uncovering nonlinear inheritance—is signaled early and escalates via the keeper’s appearance, yet the tightening is delivered through dialogue rather than a visible trade-off; cost is implied, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—find the library before time collapses—is declared but never viscerally tested; the ticking clock is metaphorical rather than tactical. One meaningful tightening occurs when plucking the flower opens the doorway, yet the price is deferred to the guardian scene, blurring cost clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—reach the garden—tightens once: the threads must be read before the door appears. Agency is Elara’s choice to weave stories; the cost is time and the card itself. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens but lacks a second, sharper pinch; coincidence does not resolve. The escalation suffices for this length but feels single-stage.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translate confusion into clarity—tightens once when braid pattern must match seal. Agency is present (Elara reconfigures rope), but pressure is intellectual; felt cost is muted, keeping score below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“quiet in the storm”—is articulated in the inciting paragraph. A single tightening occurs when Lira turns from cracked ice deciphering to seed song-making, which forecloses the possibility of further exploration; the visible cost is Lira’s exhaustion (“her body weary”). Pressure remains textural: accumulating silence saturates scenes until it displaces cacophony. The scale feels balanced for 700 drift words.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore order through pattern—presses from sentence one, escalates with star-path alignment, then tightens: memory sacrifice forecloses any lesser trade. Each step narrows options, and consequence (permanent sorrow loss) is palpable. Coincidence does not solve; it is confirmed, cementing agency.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve memory via shadow-reading—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the wingtip shadow points to the fog-wall, forcing a choice to engage. The cost is conceptual (she becomes conduit) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“defy the gravity of hopelessness”—is signaled early and tightened once via communal ignition. Cost is felt in the communal risk of renewed disappointment, but the price is more diffuse than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    Kael’s remote accusation provides the only external pressure, but Elara’s internal escalation (from chronicler to component) turns the lack of direct confrontation into an existential stake rather than empty quarrel.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape the gilded hush—tightens once when the doll slips and Elara must choose retrieval over speed; the inversion clock supplies coherent pressure. Cost is felt in the final beat: the bunker can no longer hold her, though the price is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Mira’s need for inner quiet—tightens via vial feedback and course correction. One meaningful deepening at the garden beat narrows options. Cost is legible but diffuse; a sharper forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—ascend before sunrise—tightens via mural clues and glowing flake; sunrise deadline is named but not felt as live pressure. One clear tightening beat (unlocking archway) narrows options with visible effort.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—sanctuary’s survival—tightens once when the ring demands a scar; the cost is legible and narrows Lira’s future options. Escalation is single-point but sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes—“translate pressure into diamonds”—are declared but remain metaphorical; no tangible loss or risk is attached. Escalation is a single beat: bolt + machine = diamonds, with no tightening or trade-off. Agency is present but low-stakes; Elara follows instructions rather than testing limits. The resolution feels like gift rather than earned triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the family’s downfall—is signaled early and deepens when the journal reveals internal betrayal. One tightening: knowledge replaces action, foreclosing revival. Cost is conceptual (legacy irredeemable) rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to capture the shape of possibility”—is signaled early and tightened by the accelerating vine patterns; the unsnapping beat narrows options from passive witness to active participant. Cost is conceptual (loss of old identity) but legible in the vanished program.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stake—mending Elara’s fracture by recovering a stranger’s lost mother—grows personal and stakes hope against archival anonymity. Escalation works via accumulation: each artifact (button—letter—ribbon) intensifies connection. But the cost is largely retrospective (letters not sent, promises broken) rather than a present forfeiture that narrows Elara’s living options.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—ignite resistance before capture—escalates as footsteps close in; the transmission is a clear tightening that trades safety for impact. Cost is felt: she loses the archive refuge and any future public identity.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—silence the prophecy—is signaled early and tightened through the grotto’s escalating response. One meaningful deepening: the prism’s beam locks onto the saxophonist, forcing a final crescendo that costs physical effort and spiritual depletion.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    A single dominant stake—decoding the leaves’ prophecy—tightens once when the speck chooses Elara; the pressure is coherent but the visible price (what she forfeits or risks) is only implied.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—mastery over time versus surrender to uncertainty—tightens once when he chooses to fold the map and renounce treasure. Escalation is one deepening beat under Situational lens; coincidence (swirling leaves) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is quiet but legible: he abandons lifelong craft.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“understand the weight of names”—is signaled early and tightened when the coin’s symbols lock onto her own sign. Cost is felt in the furnace vision, though the price could be more viscerally on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve confession and release soul—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the father’s refusal melts into surrender under the harp’s note. Cost is the tooth’s spent power and the gorge’s shift from sorrow to laughter. Agency is Elara’s; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—finding a merciful pattern in trauma—tightens once when the forest’s light intensifies and the strap is released. The cost is felt in the atmospheric shift from displacement to rootedness, though the escalation is more lyrical than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—honor overlooked histories—is signaled early and tightened when the map reveals the ruined tower. One meaningful deepening: the murals’ secrets reweight the city’s buried past. Cost is conceptual (stories reclaimed, fragment dimmed) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—uncover what the ceiling hides—tightens once when the girl-ghost points upward, forcing Marcus onto the counter. Cost is visible: he risks the unknown darkness above. No external antagonist; pressure is situational-ghostly. One clear escalation beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake: the tension between perfect order and negotiable reality. Escalation is textural: each shard (frost rupture, bottled whisper, cloud descent) deepens the pattern break. Agency is present—Elara steps off the platform—but the tightening is more atmospheric than tactical. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, limiting upper-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—prove temporal plasticity—tightens once when Elara risks trespass to obtain the hologram. Cost is visible: reputational ruin crystallizes into bittersweet triumph. Agency drives escalation; coincidence complicates (storm timing) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restore stolen midnight light—is signaled early and tightened once when Elias realizes the box is tethered. Agency is present (he frees the box), but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Escalation is single-arc and sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“find where explanations fail”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses to let the compass sink. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is legible yet could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—reimagining through timewoven alliance—shapes Mara’s decision, yet escalation is once removed: she views the map rather than forcing a trade-off on-page. Pressure coheres in ending image, but cost is gestured rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.9)
    A single dominant stake—capture the dream-cathedral’s hush—is signaled early, yet pressure never escalates; the postcards and journey pose no credible obstacle or trade-off. The “reckoning” with the windows is off-stage summary, so we miss the moment when options narrow or knowledge changes. No visible price (time, money, social risk) is paid, so the conflict remains atmospheric rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—truth for the silenced—is signaled early and tightens when the guardian’s question forces Elara to pledge herself. The cost is implied rather than visceral; a concrete forfeiture (time, safety, memory) would sharpen the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—revive the town—signals early. Pressure escalates via accumulative pattern: each lantern appearance tightens the miracle. Yet Elara faces no external opposition, resource limit, or internal sacrifice; the cost is purely conceptual (she must leave). One meaningful deepening occurs, but the tightening is observational, not a forced trade-off, keeping the score sub-8.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—uncover what the garden remembers—tightens once the prophecy is heard. Agency is present in Elara’s deliberate walk and spoken words, but the visible price (risk, exhaustion) is only lightly implied.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—restore balance via vortex—is declared early but never tested under pressure. Escalation is a single beat: insert acorn, gate opens. No narrowing of options or visible price; the winged creature adds texture but no opposition. The final stance crystallizes, yet it lacks a trade-off or forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—tracking a pre-storm silence—escalates through falling air-pressure data and the rope’s unexpected song; one tightening choice (tugging) conveys cost by alarming the bell and ending the market for the siren.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning in maintenance—tightens when the lantern activates the trackers, forcing Lira to choose between routine and cosmic calling. The cost is conceptual (acceptance of stillness) rather than visceral, but the deepening is legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—restore covenant—signaled early. Pressure tightens once: ghosts become visible, ritual required. Agency is present (Elias performs song), but no credible loss or resource depletion occurs; success feels pre-ordained. Coincidence (box opens alone) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is conceptual, not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—“time itself had grown uncertain”—are declared early and tested once when the symbols swirl. The meaningful tightening occurs when Elara chooses to risk the silo’s heartbeat to mend time; cost is implied (possible annihilation) but not viscerally felt. Pressure coheres under the causal lens but lacks a palpable forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—legacy of interspecies respect—tightens through each remodeling beat; the six-month clock is named but not used to alter tactics on the page, so pressure is thematic rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“understand the chemistry of homecoming”—is signaled early and tightens once: the amber map reframes the quest from intellectual to experiential. Agency is present (she places the amber), but the visible cost is conceptual rather than tangible. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—transform death to life—signaled in paragraph two. One meaningful tightening: the act of fertilizing forecloses the option to abandon the jetty; cost is the coachman’s solitary endurance. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; no reversals, but deepening suffices. Cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—will Elias re-engage or stay isolated—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the phonograph’s glow forces a perceptual shift. Cost is conceptual (solitude foregone) yet thinly embodied. Agency rests with Elias, but the leaf and machine do most of the work. No escalation beyond the single deepening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—turn confusion into exploration—is signaled early and tightens through each sketch line; the cost is the solitude she accepts at dawn. One meaningful deepening suffices, though external pressure remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“restore the sky”—is signaled early and escalates through the chess trial; the queen sacrifice visibly forecloses retreat, tightening pressure under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to shed performed identity—is signaled early and tightened once via the walking ritual that reconfigures her stance. Agency is present but mild; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. No external antagonist; pressure is situational and interior. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness—tightens when the tapestry forces Elara to confront her own “frayed soul.” The labyrinth walk is the single meaningful escalation; cost is conceptual (guilt lifted) rather than viscerally felt, keeping it just below the 8.8 band.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—salvage personal meaning before oblivion—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the charm clicks, memories flare, workshop lurches, forcing her to speak the kintsugi credo. Cost is atmospheric (possible collapse) rather than concrete; agency is slightly diluted by the statue’s autonomous glow. Sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—fulfill the hidden promise—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: oasis painting replaces the one-shell token; loss of privacy/exposure becomes the on-page cost. Pressure coheres; coincidence (boulder) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—proving quiet intent can move more than noise—is signaled early and tightened when Elias inhales the cork’s scent and chooses to follow the woman. One meaningful deepening occurs as the garden scent intensifies and the figure beckons, narrowing his options to act or retreat. Cost is legible in the chest-ache and the renunciation of louder self-assertion. Agency is present but lightly pressured; the woman’s appearance edges toward coincidence, not resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—restoring connection amid reverse migration—is signaled early and tightens as the beacon’s tone synchronizes with the relic. One clear escalation: the first arrival proves the signal works, foreclosing Mara’s solitude. Cost is implied (dimming glow) but not yet viscerally felt on page.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—control over self-truth—tightens once the eye compels speech; returning it at dawn narrows options to renunciation. Cost is the relinquishment of a potent (if dangerous) tool. Pressure is coherent but single-cycle; no secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—decoding the stranger’s gesture—tightens as each clue (print, journal) narrows Elias’s options. The pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens, but the final cost is more intellectual than visceral, keeping it just below the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.0)
    A single stake—restore balance via the doorway—is declared early, but pressure remains abstract. Escalation is scenic (creek rising, chip glowing) rather than choice-driven; no trade-off or irreversible loss occurs. The protagonist’s agency is reactive—following ants, accepting map—so the tightening is decorative. Closure’s conceptual cost is present but not viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story signals early that cosmic balance is slipping; every beat of ascent tightens the queen’s confrontation with that debt. Her final acceptance of responsibility narrows every future option, landing cost on the page (“weight of her people’s deeds”). No new reversal within the grotto, but one decisive tightening satisfies the bar for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the density of presence—is signaled early and tightened once when the shell’s glow envelops them. Agency is Elara’s chant and Kael’s reciprocal touch; the option to let the moment slip away is foreclosed. Cost is conceptual (time revalued, not lost), visible in the richer air. One clear deepening satisfies scope.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“distill chaos into narrative”—is signaled early and tightened when the scroll rewrites itself. The cost is conceptual (accepting present self) rather than visceral; escalation is a single deepening beat, sufficient under the lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—deliver the overdue apology before the orchard falls—is signaled early. Pressure tightens as the bottle’s currents grow personal, forcing the energetic apology. The cost is the orchard’s inevitable destruction; her action cannot save it, only honor it. One meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—“unify the frayed threads of existence”—is declared early but remains abstract; pressure tightens only via mystical atmosphere rather than concrete obstacles. No visible price is exacted on the page. Escalation is tonal, not tactical; options do not visibly narrow.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding what clocks truly measure—is signaled early and tightens when the hidden compartment forces a redefinition. One meaningful deepening: the scroll’s message narrows Elias’s role from technician to interpreter. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral, slightly softening the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding her father through the scrawls—tightens once when Elara decides to keep writing, foreclosing passive mourning. Cost is implied (lifelong quest) but not yet viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    The dominant stake—whether Eli will keep his emotional distance—escalates through each looping call and the rising insistence of the melody; the tightening is felt, though the price (loss of anonymity) is more implied than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve small moments—clarifies early and tightens when Mara reveals the covenant. Yet escalation is gentle; no irreversible option is foreclosed on the page. The cost is conceptual (future burden of stewardship) rather than visceral, keeping pressure moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—cure for existential loneliness—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through the magical station vision, yet the tightening is external (clock vision) rather than an irreversible choice Elara makes. No visible price is paid on the page; the “lightness” is declared, not dramatized as forfeiture or risk.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—mapping her own heart—tightens when the melody’s pull forces a choice; the cost is the surrender of external bearings. Pressure escalates via pattern intensification rather than causal reversals, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“uncover the truth, no matter how unsettling”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara must choose to write or retreat. Cost is visible (pen goes cold, anomaly shrinks), but the escalation beat is compressed into a single paragraph, muting visceral pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—silence as language—introduced early and escalates via iterative mapping. One decisive tightening: impossible click creates on-page reweighting. Cost is legible (spent body), though external stakes (will anyone ever see the photograph?) remain ambient not viscerally threatened.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake—“to rescue a forgotten promise”—stays lyrical and intangible; no visible price or narrowing of alternatives is dramatized in scene. Tension relies on atmospheric pacing rather than a felt risk of loss, keeping the pressure soft.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: will Elara remain a passive victim or repurpose the treatment’s side-effect? Pressure tightens when the lagoon responds to her drumming, forcing a visible stance shift. Cost is the acceptance of collective grief as creative material. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“prove subtlety outlasts force”—is signaled early and tightened when Mira demands proof. The key-turn is the single decisive escalation; cost is the labyrinth’s possible collapse and Eli’s acceptance of Mira’s presence. Agency is clear; coincidence (finding matching lock) complicates rather than resolves. One more beat of visible forfeiture would lift it to 8.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—stranger’s need to release a secret—tightens once when mirror reflection reframes self-perception. Agency is the guardian’s silent endurance; cost is the stranger’s departure and guardian’s continued solitude. No reversals, but deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“plant forests of second thoughts”—is declared early but never tested under pressure; no visible price is exacted from Elias. Escalation is tonal (amplified quiet) rather than causal; the synchronized displays succeed without complication or trade-off. Agency remains inspirational rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—embrace true self—tightens once when Elara must let the scrimshaw go. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative/Textural lens; the whale’s call intensifies mood rather than narrows options, so escalation is more cadence than crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—how to honor grief under mandated joy—tightens as whittling shifts from habit to emblem. One meaningful deepening occurs when the heart is placed beside the bouquet, foreclosing open expression yet costing her public safety. Cost is felt but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—permission to transcend artistic limits—is signaled early and tightened through the poet’s escalating surrender to the quartz. One meaningful deepening: the ice cracks and lifts, mirroring internal dissolution. Cost is legible in the final hush.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding beauty without color—tightens when the reed tongue awakens and Elias must decide how to wield its song; the trade-off (plant message vs. direct play) crystallizes the cost, though escalation is more lyrical than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—recovering human connection through sound—is declared early, but escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; each refracted sound deepens theme yet narrows no live option. No visible price is paid on the page; the pilgrimage ends in affirmation without forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—personal healing—stays coherent, but external opposition or time pressure is absent; tension grows within emotional arc rather than narrowing external options.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—uncover engineered collapse—signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is one steady deepening: anomalies → conspiracy mural → revelation of control paradigm. Agency remains with Elara; each multiplication of paths narrows her ethical options. Cost is felt in the dawn exhaustion and the irreversible knowledge they now carry. No false reversals, but an on-page forfeiture (e.g., destroyed data drive) would sharpen the price.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve self while pursuing forbidden knowledge—tightens once: the pagoda offers either external mastery or internal purification, not both. Escalation is a cadence shift: the erased pattern beat narrows options from deciphering to renunciation. Cost is the loss of innocence, felt in the “anguished joy.” Agency drives the final stance crystallization; coincidence only complicates the archive’s shifting layout.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“give form to forgotten hope”—is signaled early and tightens once when the shadow manifests; the cost is conceptual (bearing collective sorrow) but less viscerally dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—rebuilding trust after betrayal—is signaled early and tightened once: betrayal revealed → tail tip reweighted. The pressure is situational and emotional; no external antagonist appears, but the tightening is sufficient for the length. Cost is felt in the quiet renunciation of her former certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    A single dominant stake—recovering the displaced miracle—drives the piece; pressure deepens through the tunnel visions, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal. The final merging is a graceful crystallization rather than a narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“where unused love is stored”—is signaled early and deepens as letters merge. One tightening beat: projector halts, forcing Elara’s decision. Cost is conceptual (burden of untold stories) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.5)
    Dominant stake—restore village creativity via stardust—is declared early. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal: aurora sings louder, astrolabe trembles, yet no tightening choice or trade-off appears. Escalation is textural (density of wonder) rather than option-narrowing. Cost remains abstract; no visible forfeiture on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“cultivate sparks”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara realizes the archive needs the clock. Cost is conceptual: she must surrender the relic’s stasis to restart time, foreclosing her own nostalgic refuge. One clear escalation beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“rediscover the wild frontier of his mind”—is signaled early; pressure deepens via accumulating anomalies. The tightening beat is the gear’s insertion, but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page, keeping escalation moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—“find where unused courage waits”—is signaled early and narrows to the single act of traversing; the indirect route and deepening twilight escalate tension. Yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“cost of safety” versus “unpardonable silence”—is signaled early and tightens once when Elias touches the bolt. The escalation is a single deepening rather than reversal, but the price (bearing the fortress’s truth) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are declared early: expose the pretender or the realm remains in shadow. Pressure escalates through each annotated book, culminating in a public unmasking. The cost is visible—the pretender’s shaking hand, the clattering pellet—but not yet felt by Elara herself.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—why paths disappear—surfaces early and tightens via the atlas mystery. One clear deepening occurs when she links the vanished coast to fossil origins, but the cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: personal purpose in a rebel lull. The hum intensifies and refocuses that stake by converting cosmic awe into practical duty; one visible cost is the renunciation of grand combat imagery in favor of “quiet moments of connection.” No reversals, yet deepening narrows options—from “adrift” to sole bearer of renewed hope. Coincidence is ruled out; the stone circle’s presence is grounded, not lucky rescue, and she must still walk out into that margin of daylight.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—evolve tradition or lose it—signaled early via forbidden temple ruins and regime fear. Tightening occurs when Mara aligns embryo to kite script: the act narrows options from secrecy to open insurgency. Cost is visible—the embryo cracks, irreversible—and the hot-spring eruption externalizes the risk. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens; coincidence (guard’s departure) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“can she reassemble creative self?”—is signaled early and tightens as cards are rearranged. Agency is present in every beat; the Tower’s re-reading narrows options toward transformation. Cost is the luminescent ache that persists, but it is more stated than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—uncover why time distorts in crisis—is signaled early and tightened when the ink forces confrontation with memory. Escalation is single-note: discovery, revelation, acceptance. Cost is emotional, visible in tears, but no tactical forfeiture sharpens the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—suppress vs expose contraband truths—tightens once when the network activation countdown begins. Cost is legible: exposure is irreversible. A sharper on-page forfeiture (e.g., deletion of her own clearance) would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—protect the farm—is clear, yet pressure plateaus after Kael’s warning; no on-page incursion or resource loss forces a trade-off, so escalation is declared rather than dramatized. The blade’s acceptance is a micro-turn but carries no immediate cost.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—restoring the goddess’s echo—is signaled early and tightened once when the constellations freeze. Agency is mostly receptive (listening, walking) until the final acceptance, so the pressure deepens more than it narrows options. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; the reader feels the echo’s return but not what Kael forfeits.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—truth vs complicity—escalates cleanly: each piece of evidence raises the price. The tightening beat is her decision to recalibrate, foreclosing retreat; cost is legible in the vanishing journalist and her own exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—silencing guilt—tightens when the letters force confrontation; the decisive deepening is her decision to answer as the child, which forecloses denial. Cost is visible in the lab’s meteor hush. No external reversals needed; internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—discover meaning in chaos—is signaled early and tightens through mandala’s transformation; one deepening beat when the hand shape emerges. Cost is felt but abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—make mercy normative—stays thematic, never crystallizes into a concrete test or irreversible choice. Escalation is gentle description layered upon itself; no tightening or deepening narrows options. Agency is limited to symbolic rearrangement; no visible price is paid. Coincidence (wind carrying “scent of renewal”) resolves nothing, but also doesn’t complicate.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“lure possibility from despair”—is signaled early and tightened when Mara offers the coin; the transfer of hope carries visible emotional cost, but escalation is more atmospheric than option-narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—“to illuminate what went wrong”—is declared early but never tested; no concrete obstacle or trade-off appears. Escalation is tonal (blues and silvers “pulse”) rather than causal; the only narrowing is dawn’s arrival, which feels external. Cost is missing: no failed attempts, no resource limits, no personal risk.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—uncovering forgotten history—intensifies via heat-map anomalies and fossil guidance, but escalation is more discovery than pressure; the tightening is intellectual rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—unscramble the echo to convert prophecy into possibility—is signaled early. Escalation is a single deepening: bone button syncs with jar, voices swell, options reconfigure. Cost is conceptual (burden of guardianship) rather than visceral, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming courage—tightens through deciphering snow-codes and the pillbox temptation. One meaningful deepening: letter reframes courage as memory, narrowing options and exacting the cost of leaving the pill unused.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—acquire the promise—is personal and signaled early, but escalation is purely atmospheric pressure; no concrete forfeiture or resource jeopardy tightens until the figure hands over a scroll, diluting the cost legibility required to push above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—alleviation of urban loneliness—surfaces early. Pressure tightens once when Elara decides to descend, but the escalation is gentle; the lockmaster’s arrival is external coincidence rather than earned complication. Cost is implied (opening to another person) yet not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence—is signaled early and tightened when the hum becomes a call. The orb’s integration forces a trade-off, but the cost is more metaphysical than concrete, keeping escalation vivid yet slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: prevent unseen manipulation via signal. Pressure tightens when sponsors threaten shutdown and protests erupt. Counter-frequency is a decisive, costly act that narrows options—she commits to endless vigilance. Escalation is causal and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the key—tightens when walls contract and claustrophobia spikes; the cost is visceral (fear of entrapment). Agency drives the climax: Elara’s decision to yield to mutiny reshapes space. One clear escalation beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—awakening empathy for Lila—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the second ribbon appears, but the escalation is situational coincidence rather than protagonist-driven; Elara’s agency remains observational. Cost is implied (emotional risk) yet not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.2)
    Stakes center on restoring an erased reputation; one tightening beat—the ritual activation—compresses this to a single decision. The cost (“what would it cost?”) is mentioned verbally before the ritual but not paid visibly on the page; the story pivots to mystical resolution rather than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—uncover what the hitchhiker sought—tightens once when the flake aligns with peaks. Pressure grows texturally rather than causally; agency is mostly interpretive. A felt cost is implied but not dramatized on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—why paths circle back—is signaled early and tightened through the journal’s revelation and the scavenger’s threat. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elias chooses to protect “the stories,” foreclosing loot. Cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—decode inscriptions to heal her own fractures—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the constellation pattern forces recognition that burdens must be shared. Cost is conceptual (abandoning solitary silence) but visible in her dawn smile; no tangible loss is dramatized, keeping it just shy of higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“discover what mirrors don’t show”—is tested by escalating vortex chaos; each circle deepens the cost of surrender. Tightening is singular but sufficient: unbending forecloses her lifelong self-shielding. Price is the spoken confession and permanent shift from shield to resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore the covenant—is signaled early and tightens once when the hidden path appears. Cost is felt in the glowing scars, but the price remains more luminous than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. service—tightens once when the shadow-self demands payment. Agency drives escalation: Elara’s choice to stay forecloses escape. Cost is legible on-page; no coincidence resolves the conflict. One meaningful turn suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding post-failure purpose—pressures every choice; the deepening comes when Elias chooses to “wrest” the story back, narrowing options from passive insulation to active re-creation.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding transition—is signaled early and deepened through visions, yet pressure stays intellectual; no concrete option is foreclosed or price paid on the page. The tightening is conceptual rather than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring stable identity—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through the runic rearrangement, forcing Elara to a single decisive act. The cost is conceptual (accepting permanent flux) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—dissolving isolation—surfaces early. Escalation is atmospheric rather than causal; the pearl’s pull and crown’s chorus intensify mood but do not narrow options or exact an on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—self-forgiveness via unfiltered memory—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightened when she chooses to unfold the self-drawn map instead of retreating. The graffiti phrase “The river knows” escalates pressure by personalizing her lifelong subject. Cost is visible: the single mournful note she releases is both test and wound. No external antagonist needed; the conflict is internal and coherent under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—access redemptive truth—ratchets through humming code and time leak in ticking watch. Escalation causal: each decipher step slices options until final act of inscription forecloses passive stance. Felt cost (future custodianship) legible, though external pressure is soft.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—dream vs. Dominion—tightens through two decisive beats: augury narrowing choice and violin execution foreclosing empire’s claim; visible social cost resonates strongly under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“capture one last spark”—is signaled early and tightens when the traveler reframes stillness as endurance; the single deepening is coherent, though the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—finding the source of contentment—is signaled early and tightened when the map appears. The lake vision escalates pressure by forcing a total recontextualization of her caretaking life. Cost is conceptual (immersion in every past life) but less viscerally felt on return; still, the choice to keep climbing afterward forecloses lingering regret.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—Mara’s paralysis under the cloak of doubt—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: Elias translates chimes into guidance, then acts. The tightening is more interpretive than causal, so escalation feels gentle. Cost is conceptual, not visceral, keeping the score just below the 7.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. concealment—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to speak; the withheld truth’s release narrows her future options. Cost is present but generalized; a more specific forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decipher the arrowhead’s purpose—escalates through the flock’s tightening patterns, forcing Kael to abandon external quest for internal stillness. Cost is visible: centuries of inherited duty are traded for a solitary, uncharted path. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens; coincidence is absent. A crisper mid-scene beat where tactics visibly alter would secure the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving real magic can still work—escalates as spire walls close in; mist-walking choice carries predictable yet legible tension and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—uncover the color of sound—is signaled early and reasserted at closure. Pressure escalates via the key’s growing warmth and the blank page awaiting his vow, but the tightening is more atmospheric than tactical; no live option is foreclosed on the page. The cost is implied rather than dramatized, muting urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unlock the backwards prophecy to resurrect the contracted universe—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is causal: each coin distilled narrows her options until refusal is impossible. Cost is visible: the distilled essence glows with “otherworldly light,” implying irreversible commitment. One tightening beat suffices; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—whether Elara can transmute grief into meaning—tightens when the runes flare and the monsters rise. Agency is clear: her act of naming forecloses passive mourning. A visible price is implied as the monsters dissolve, but the cost could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—town memory versus forgetting—is signaled early and tightens through the photograph trail. The meaningful turn is Elias’s decision to mount the exhibit, but the cost is borne collectively; his personal risk remains abstract. Escalation is steady under the Accumulative lens, yet the final beat feels more communal triumph than irreversible trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition—is signaled early and tightened once when the flame tests her resolve. The cost is conceptual (softened boundaries) rather than visceral, but it is legible on the page. No escalation beyond the single tightening, sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—is signaled early and tightened through escalating pattern recognition; the final crystallization of the sequence forces a stance that forecloses failure. Cost is felt in the “weight” carried forward, though it could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (defeat emotional numbness) is signaled early and tightened through the duel’s mirrored pressure. Each parry narrows options until the final strike forecloses separateness; the cost is the surrender of a discrete past self. Agency is clear; coincidence is absent.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes (safeguard the haven, solve the enigma) are signaled early and tighten when the key appears; however, escalation is mostly atmospheric—no concrete trade-off or loss is dramatized before the door opens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore laughter—is signaled early and escalates through intensifying sound density. One meaningful tightening: the tunnel’s shift from hollow to warm. Cost is visible in Eli’s heaving chest, though the external stakes remain abstract (“the world itself”).

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—library’s safety versus homesickness—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: keeper’s warning raises cost of using pendant. Agency rests in Elara’s refusal; cost is legible (“the garden will fade”). No reversals beyond the single decisive tightening, adequate for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake: break “stifling destiny of failure.” Each press of the crozier escalates scarcity of likelihood rather than speed, tightening until the sapling signals the decisive shift. One micro-turn suffices; cost is visible in relinquished resurrection. No lucky resolutions—Elara’s hands bleed, ash sticks.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“find the beginning in every ending”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara realizes the shard is a mirror, not a tool. The pressure deepens through her successive assumption-drops, narrowing options until the final release. Cost is conceptual but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“discover the texture of connection”—is signaled early and tightened when the shadow-man warns of unraveling. Escalation is textural: each weave thickens the hallucination until the gallery collapses, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is legible but generalized.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—save the star-navigation tradition—escalates from Council threat to public ritual. One meaningful tightening: the decommission order forces Elara’s hybrid curriculum. Cost is social (risk of irrelevance) more than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—safeguard a forgotten voice—lacks a felt on-page cost beyond walking; a single escalation beat (finding the crevice-photo) advances but never threatens failure or forces trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—retrieve the fleck to glimpse the unseen—gains relentless pressure as water cycles, walls crumble, and claustrophobia spikes. A mid-story tightening (vault door groans open) shrinks options to “face the invisible or retreat”. Felt cost arrives as she relinquishes the hope of bringing Dr. Voss back.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—prove she’s alive—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: inkblot → defragment → ghost reveal narrows options from “solve error” to “accept erased timeline.” Cost is felt in the tearful recognition of paths untaken. Agency is cerebral, not physical, but still forecloses the old identity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes “save dying language” are clear early; tension coils around each phrase translated. The tightening beat comes when singing saps her strength—she must decide: continue until death or stop and fail. She chooses endurance; the price is collapse and diamond destruction. The arc earns its closure without outside rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recover proof of cryptid origins—tightens when the arrowhead’s pull forces a stance shift. Pressure escalates via the garden’s metamorphosis; agency crystallizes in Lena’s laughter-renunciation. Cost is felt but lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restore beauty vs mechanical order—signaled early. Escalation is one sustained crescendo: music unsettles statues, heartbeat sync triggers revolt. Agency remains Elara’s; coincidence plays no role. Cost is legible (orchar reclaims magic, statues crumble), though the price to Elara personally is muted.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—deliver the storm to heal the border—is signaled early and tightened once when patrol drone forces evasive dive. Escalation is causal: each scanner sweep raises risk, narrowing options. Cost is visible in trembling hands and the quiet forfeiture of staying to witness the truce. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (crevice) slightly dilutes pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—redeem silence into possibility—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: fragment’s warmth compels song, which costs the safety of muteness. No external antagonist; escalation is internal and mystical, yet the price is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the living story-realm—is signaled early and tightens through geometric rearrangements that visibly narrow options; the final crystallization of guardianship carries conceptual cost, though the price is more elegiac than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the light pulses and the photograph behaves, forcing Elara to shift from retrieval to creation. Cost is the luminous absence of the original dream, felt in the final image. Agency remains hers; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing the idea—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through the vault’s resistance, but the living locks never raise the cost; the phrase solves them without trade-off. The final release feels inevitable rather than earned by sacrifice. One tightening beat exists, yet its price is conceptual, not visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—tightens when the missing mushroom reveals the locket, forcing a new tactic (look skyward). Pressure is coherent but mild; the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake: free the trapped shadow to prove reversible exile is possible. Pressure escalates via pattern density—each annotated leaf narrows interpretive options until the shadow “softens.” One clear tightening beat: her last inscription converts mirror from prison to bridge. Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes certainty—but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is preservation of wonder via single seed; decision to plant under budding-hope pressure deepens one choice. No active antagonist, escalation is internal (risk of full orchard loss), cost appears as irrevocable planting and possible overstretch of her craft.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—grounding the spirits—tightens as knots resist; one clear escalation when the stubborn knot threatens to stall the rite. Cost is present (emotional weight, trembling hands) but less viscerally foregrounded than the atmospheric payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—bridging known/unknown via silence—is signaled early. Escalation is textural: each layer peeled back (video, stone, soil) tightens the cost of knowing. The final discovery forecloses the option of leaving the site untouched; Elara’s guardianship is the price. Agency is present but slightly undercut by the convenient wooden beams “preserved by silence.”

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—understanding letting go—escalates through map discovery and letter revelation, tightening from curiosity to practice. Single meaningful turn: decision to leave globe. Cost is conceptual (accept impermanence) rather than visceral, but legible under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing the ghost—is signaled early and tightened by the lightning–thunder clock. One deepening: graffiti morphs into sigils, narrowing options to the bolt-plate ritual. Cost is implied (loss of the ghost’s touch) but not dramatized as a trade-off. Agency is present but cushioned by intuition rather than hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—uncover the diary’s meaning—remains abstract; no floor presents a dilemma that narrows her path or exacts a cost. Pressure is atmospheric, not agonistic. One tightening beat (key fits lock) is too late to escalate.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“prove empty spaces remember”—is signaled early and tightened when the glowing cloud offers proof. The leap is the single meaningful turn, but the lack of a visible price (injury, loss, irreversible change) keeps escalation from fully charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes—“mirror sky before building falls”—are clear but escalate mostly through announced doom. Progressive constraints (decoding coin, tremor walls) tighten options once credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—charting the next discovery—tightens once when the hopscotch board activates and forecloses retreat. Cost is visible: Elara descends alone into cold darkness, trading safety for knowledge. Pressure is coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“learn the rhythm of repair”—is signaled early; pressure tightens when the mirrors force a stance crystallization. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete, but the deepening is legible under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear—restore the nebula—but pressure escalates only through cooperative montage rather than narrowing options. The decisive act (striking the bell) is low-friction; the cost is communal joy rather than personal loss. Agency is collective, diluting individual jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: forestall final midnight. Pressure tightens when the hush “holds its breath” and the beam falters; agency is the blood-fed pattern-weaving that forecloses surrender. Cost is visceral—blood, ragged breath—yet escalation is single-note; no secondary reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—break the curse while saving intruders—tightens when the nut’s map forces a live rescue under bird patrol. Cost: exposure to mechanical beaks and the orchard’s first hopeful crack.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into connection—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: realization that separation can bridge, not bar. Cost is conceptual rather than tangible; pressure escalates via interior deepening rather than external stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—restore narrative wholeness—is signaled early and tightened once: the scattered vial forces the ascent and the incision. The price (spent moonlight, blank pages now hers to fill) is legible but abstract; the tightening feels more symbolic than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—alleviating remorse—tightens when each memory tasted raises the risk of being overwhelmed. The single decisive intensification occurs at the central shard, where Elara’s agency subsumes collective remorse at visible emotional cost. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—mending communal fracture—is signaled early and tightened when Mr. Kovar steps forward, narrowing Elara’s task from solo repair to shared stewardship. The price is the irreversible exposure of private grief in public song, felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—resurrect abandoned dreams via memory entanglement—tightens once when the mirror becomes portal. Agency drives escalation, but the cost is more declared than felt; still, the choice forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—unlock forgotten combinations—tightens once when gravity flips, narrowing options to a single seed; agency is clear, cost visible, no reversal beyond the threshold moment.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dominant stake—unlock silent music aloud—faces one on-page test: will cracks crack back. Escalation is soft; tension rises slowly as files chip but no hard pivot or tightening. Insulator’s role feels coincidental, not an active complication.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—restoring trust through silence—is signaled early and tightens via the chessboard’s accelerating pattern. One meaningful deepening occurs when the knight’s sacrifice forces her to relinquish the past. Cost is visible in the toppled king and the stone’s weight, though external stakes could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering silenced stories—signaled early. One meaningful tightening: clasp resists until frequency attunement succeeds. Cost is conceptual (burden of legacy) rather than visceral; no live option is foreclosed. Pressure is textural, not causal, but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.9)
    Dominant stake—“longing for something beyond the tangible”—is abstract; pressure does not tighten through beats but drifts via mood. No on-page reversal or trade-off narrows options; the tide’s thought and seed scent merely deliver insight without forcing renunciation or cost. Agency is observational, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—planet’s resilience fading—is signaled early and tightens when echoes dim. One meaningful deepening occurs as Elara realizes the grove’s role, but the cost of restoration is off-loaded to the planet rather than borne by her.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single dominant stake—preventing future catastrophe—gains clarity as she documents the impossible wind canyon. The tightening occurs at the revelation of mis-stacked containers funneling gusts into a death corridor; Elara’s agency lies in the cognitive act that yields the cost: “hindsight was all she had.” Coincidence (storm plus pilot bad luck) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder as essential”—is signaled early and escalates through color-dense bell strikes that tighten toward the hush’s emergence. Pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens, yet the tightening is aesthetic rather than option-narrowing; no visible price is exacted from Elara beyond effort.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“prevent history repeating”—ratchets with each retrieved marker. One meaningful tightening: the humming flute narrows options to play or flee. Cost legible on page; escalation coherent under situational lens despite convenient rift.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—deciphering the mathematics of emotion—tightens when overload threatens identity. One clear escalation: the surge of foreign emotions forces Elias to stagger back, narrowing options. Cost is visible but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver the relic vs. keep the wonder it awakens—is signaled early and tightens once when the scholar declares “It’s been waiting for you.” The tightening forces Elara’s stance crystallization with a felt conceptual cost: she leaves carrying the relic’s heartbeat. Agency is present but gentle; pressure is more atmospheric than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving objects hold emotion—faces a single decisive test when grief floods in. The tightening is the moment she lifts the prism and feels the cost; options narrow from data to stewardship. Pressure is coherent but stops short of a second constriction.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—bridging impossible distance via silence—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when each puzzle piece narrows the path, but escalation is more atmospheric than causal. The final bridge crystallizes the choice, yet the felt price is diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—planet’s renewal vs. personal awakening—is signaled early and tightened once: the mine descent forecloses retreat. Cost is implied but not dramatized on the page; the awakening lost remains conceptual, so escalation is clear yet not fully paid.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake—“discover the weight of a withheld truth”—is signaled early and escalates when the woman warns “heavier than you imagine.” Yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral; no concrete forfeiture is dramatized on the page, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—“protect the light”—is signaled early and tightened by the lamp’s failure and the urgent message. Escalation is coherent but leans on mystery mechanics rather than escalating external threat; cost remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—ushering a new dawn—tightens when the beam veers; the Herald’s agency to steer against fog resistance supplies escalating pressure and visible cost. One clear tightening beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—why stories magnetize and whether to share them—surfaces early and tightens through Kael’s encounter. The woman’s disclosure is the single pressure point, but escalation is gentle; no visible price alters Kael’s tactics. Agency is contemplative rather than decisive, fitting the Accumulative lens yet limiting urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—transforming quantified sorrow into witnessed resilience—is signaled early and deepens as dreams coalesce. One tightening beat: the sextant’s glass realigns, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost is conceptual (bearing witness) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—restore communal light—is signaled early and escalates as each song-fragment forecloses another memory. The decisive tightening occurs when the final lullaby demands total self-erasure; cost is visible, though external stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—embracing paradox instead of hiding—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara decides to “hide no more”; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, satisfying the lens yet lacking a tangible forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“preserve vows before illusions fade”—is signaled early and tightened when the anomalous slide rewrites itself. Agency is reactive (slide acts on Elara) rather than proactive, but pressure coheres under Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual: she must now “carry the light forward.”

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes—“truce of hush” and father’s stolen shipment—are declared early, but pressure escalates only through dialogue threats rather than narrowing options or visible cost. The final standoff defuses via words, leaving the truce intact and the cost abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—why some carry weather—is declared early but never tested on the page; no tightening or cost is dramatized. The election is off-stage; pressure is atmospheric, not actionable. Agency is limited to following the ring; no visible price or narrowing of options occurs.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—escape mechanical portraiture for authentic creation—is signaled early and tightened when the forgotten painting confronts her. One meaningful deepening: the cave’s silence shifts from peace to suffocation, forcing the final act. Cost is the forfeiture of her safe reputation. Agency drives every beat; coincidence (note placement) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—recover lost conversations to restore the oasis—is signaled early and tightened when Elara hears the lovers’ betrayal. The deepening (oasis was sacrificed) narrows her moral choice, and the cost (gilded leaves wilt) is visible. Agency drives the final inscription, though the price feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes—“preserve the color of wonder”—remain thematic; no live option is foreclosed on the page. Escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.4)
    Listening versus intrusion tightens once: Clara’s choice to open the box escalates the conflict; cost is felt but stakes plateau rather than surge.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—liberate buried knowledge—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: the dance must succeed or the knowledge stays entombed. The cost is the dice falling silent, a felt forfeiture. Agency is Elara’s alone; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—is signaled early and tightened by the ritual’s risk. Agency is Eli’s decision to recite the patterns and step forward; cost is the irreversible knowledge that memories are merely misplaced, not recoverable at will. One meaningful deepening, no reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dominant stake—preventing prophecy-triggered chaos—is clear and escalates through the smoothing ritual. However, the tightening is more a gradual intensification than a decisive narrowing of options, and the cost remains conceptual rather than tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—learning the buried language—emerges mid-scene and tightens when Elias links the seal to “truths we’ve buried.” One clear escalation: Clara moves from passive listener to active borrower of sugar, foreclosing isolation. Cost is social exposure, lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—translate quarantined memories or remain isolated—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: yielding to the shell’s resonance narrows her options to custodianship. Cost is felt in the ghostly figure’s warning and the orchid’s lost glow. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens via intensifying sensory density rather than causal reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—will Elara release her father’s betrayal—is signaled early and tightened through each dissolved word. Escalation is emotional and accumulative; the drip slows as tension peaks. Cost is visible: the scroll is forever altered, and her future forgeries will carry this new stance.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding echoes—is signaled early and deepened through the pool vision, which narrows options to acceptance. Pressure is coherent but gentle; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vision reweights her purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    One dominant stake—salvaging the family’s memory—tightens through each dream fragment; the deepening is steady but the visible price (time, cold, emotional toll) is more implied than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake—‘honor the unseen labor’—is thematic, never concretized into escalating jeopardy or sacrificed option. Accumulation of images provides tonal deepening but no single beat forces Elara to relinquish or risk anything on-screen. Escalation plateau at contemplative deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—uncover truth versus orchard life—is clear from the second paragraph. Escalation tightens when the letters reveal the prison, forcing an active containment ritual. Visible price: stillpoint survives but requires eternal watch—stakes reweighted. A single meaningful turn is sufficient for word count, though pressure is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    One dominant stake—shape a new dawn—is signaled early and tightened when the voice demands the “unfold” choice. The escalation is more atmospheric than beat-driven; the cost is visible but generalized rather than granular.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—redeeming lost voices—signaled in paragraph two; pressure tightens when the box refuses to play, then deepens when it suddenly overflows, forcing Elias to drop the jar. Cost is visible (shattered glass, lost capture) but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—protect the key and sonic absolution—intensifies as the intruder’s harmonic demand exposes planetary disharmony; Elara’s adaptation narrows options, forcing a costly harmonic counterstrike.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake is internal refinement: shift from inner rush to calm vigilance. One tightening is signaled—renouncing sprint for slow deliberate pace—but stakes are cerebral without pressing resource, personal, or external cost, so escalation feels quiet rather than narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake—prove Thomas may be innocent—is verbalized early but never tested in scene; no new evidence or obstacle raises the cost. Escalation plateaus; the only narrowing is Elias’s silent decision. Thematic price is asserted (“he hadn’t given up”), not viscerally enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.0)
    Dominant stake—“ring a bell no one hears”—is declared early but never tested by an opposing force or resource limit. Pressure is atmospheric, not causal; the “breakthrough” arrives via montage, not a tightening choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is archive silence shedding light on silence of the disappeared; truth becomes a deadly commitment. Numbers escalate as coordinates delete, tightening choices. Agency forces offline bypass, real cost: data purged. Trade-off crystallizes in the final stride into unknown space.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—mending fractured souls via empathy—is declared, not tested under rising pressure. Mirrors provide deepening knowledge but no narrowing of options; no tangible cost is dramatized until the light spreads. Escalation is informational, not causal. Agency is present but consequence remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—learning the “sound of endings”—is signaled early and tightens through each survivor story; the final cadence shift reweights it from fear to acceptance. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete, but the pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—reconciling destined-yet-mismatched love—tightens once through reflection, but pressure remains internal; no external consequence or tangible loss raises the cost of her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—“preserve the echo before the prophet arrives”—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking consecration ritual. Agency is present (she kneels, speaks, glow) but the cost is deferred to the prophet’s word rather than felt bodily. One meaningful deepening: the clearings awaken at her touch.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—transforming pain into shared memory—is signaled early; pressure deepens as photographs are laid out, but the tightening is gentle, more accumulation than irreversible trade-off. No visible price is exacted on the page, so escalation remains moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of aging—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened through each failed listening until the final hum. One meaningful deepening: the chalk circle unintentionally closes, forcing recognition. Cost is felt in the relinquishment of the chalk and the acceptance of echo-creation. Agency remains Elias’s throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—harness the ephemeral without freezing it—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: dismantling the clock forecloses repair and risks total loss. Cost is conceptual (surrender to flow) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—Mrs. Bennett’s need for a “flawless goodbye”—is signaled early and tightens when blood work confirms time is short. Escalation is single-note but sufficient: Elara’s agency narrows to summoning Claire; cost is visible in the mother’s frail whisper and Claire’s red eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—“where shadows go at noon”—is signaled early and tested at the precipice. Escalation is a single tightening: shadows coalesce into void, forcing Elara to act. Cost is visible: the key’s glow dies, its purpose spent. No external antagonist needed; pressure is situational and coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“to turn mistakes into constellations”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara must trade certainty for healing. The single reversal (offering the stone) narrows options, though the price feels more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—share gentle starlight without fire—is signaled early and tightened through the polishing ritual; the mist’s thickening and moonbeam’s arrival create a single intensification that reweights options. Cost is atmospheric rather than visceral, nudging the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—protected vulnerability—signaled early. Pressure deepens when Kai arrives, forcing Elara to test her sanctuary. The tightening is gentle: sharing the notebook crystallizes the stake but does not visibly foreclose any live option; cost remains atmospheric rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—“collecting hopes without being consumed”—is signaled early and steadily escalates under Accumulative/Textural lens: each cameo raises emotional density until the tree of shells makes retreat impossible. Cost is visible when Elara relinquishes proprietary control over the stories; agency remains hers, though escalation could be sharper if an earlier exit option were shown then stripped away.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—restore forgotten songs to heal land—is clear, yet pressure plateaus after initial setup. No tightening beat narrows options; the songs simply arrive when moon and tendril align. Agency is observational; escalation is atmospheric, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—translate heartbeats into maps—is declared early. Pressure tightens via the sealing ritual, but the orchard itself offers no active opposition; escalation is more atmospheric than causal, and the cost (spent starlight) is present yet low-impact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—capture wonder before the season ends—is signaled early and tightens when dusk alignment becomes the last viable moment. The deepening is Elias’s realization that the harvest is “only the beginning,” foreclosing rest. Cost is present but generalized (“he slept little”).

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether Elara will keep bearing others’ burdens or confront her own—is signaled early. The figure’s offer tightens the pressure once, forcing a trade-off. Cost is visible in the fissure and the lamp’s brighter burn. Agency remains internal; the external figure is catalyst, not resolver.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single stake: can she carve loss into form? Pressure intensifies with each curling shavings-chip; final pass of blade forecloses retreat, leaving smooth ash-lion as irreversible choice. Agency sustained, cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—negotiate with her own ghost—is signaled early and tightened once: the wheel’s voice reframes regret from enemy to guide, narrowing her options to “collect, rebuild, step.” Cost is visible in the weight she still carries and the moonlit step that forecloses surrender. Escalation is modest but sufficient for 700-word scope; no external reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—resurrecting hope via the terminal—is signaled early and tightened once when Eli realizes the resurrection must be temporary. Agency drives escalation: each redirected flow is a choice that forecloses the fantasy of permanent revival. Cost is visible at dawn when the illusion must be abandoned. Pressure remains coherent under the Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—bury or bear the dream—is signaled early; pressure tightens once when the crystals hiss “bear.” The single deepening is sufficient, but the cost is more atmospheric than concrete; no tool or stamina visibly lost.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake understood: reveal truth/reveal lies. Salvage beat advances this by unlocking journal confession. Escalates when sundial glow reflects codified truth, tightening choices. Cost visible in emotional weight but not yet paid in action.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—writing as healing geography—is signaled early and tightened each time traveler’s pen moves. Final gifting of notebook forecloses “waiting” mode for old woman; cost is the traveler accepting reciprocal thread, binding future journeys. Escalation through obituary words crystallizing grief is palpable.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.7)
    Mechanical decay versus natural rebirth tightens with each beat; the choice to risk a renaissance embodies a visible conceptual cost. Stakes tilt larger than the page can fully field.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—proving scars can sing—tightens once when Elara risks the graft; the sterility of the sand raises the cost. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens; no reversals required.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.0)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—“share light without fire”—is signaled early and escalates through the gear’s intensifying glow. One meaningful tightening occurs when the gear becomes conduit, foreclosing the fire path. The cost is conceptual (she accepts endless responsibility) but not viscerally felt on the page, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake—grasping collective grief’s shape—signaled early. Escalation hinges on a single, interior tightening: from static impossibility to dynamic migration insight. Cost feels abstract—Tomas’s departing presence—and not viscerally enacted on the page. Escalation is present but not piercing enough for the 8+ bracket.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.1)
    Central conflict is the fragile balance between communal guilt and Elias’s ticking absolution; one tightening shift occurs when the rake inscriptions force incremental repair to town relationships. Cost is legible and earned in daily choices rather than dramatic reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the tapestry to give voice to the forgotten—is signaled early and deepens through pattern recognition. One meaningful tightening occurs when the last thread is untangled, crystallizing Elias’s vocation. Cost is present but abstract; no tangible loss or forfeiture is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation or remain frozen—is signaled early and tightened when the quill writes unbidden, foreclosing retreat. The cost is legible (the kingdom’s silence must now be answered), yet the escalation is more lyrical than visceral, limiting upper-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—recover lost stories—is clear. Pressure tightens when the song appears, but escalation is driven by external transmission rather than Clara’s choices; no visible price is paid or option foreclosed on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—honoring the dead through impermanence—is signaled early. Tightening occurs when the rocking chair stops, forcing the final scattering; cost is the irrevocable loss of the portrait’s last physical trace. Escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.0)
    The dominant stake—cling to relics vs. risk losing them—appears early. Pressure tightens only once, when the collapse forces Kael to act, but the escalation is delivered by messenger rather than by an on-page test of his commitment. The cost (leaving the sewer) is visible, yet the choice is reactive, not proactive, undercutting agency.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming vanishing arts—tightens via subtraction of noise; pressure grows as choir dwindles then swells. One meaningful deepening occurs when humming replaces speech, narrowing options to pure sound. Cost is implied rather than viscerally paid on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“gentle rebellion against indifference”—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses to prune debris instead of flee doubt. Cost is felt: she stays alone through dawn, staking her time and safety on the fruit’s promise.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake—“preserve wonder”—is declared early but only abstractly tested; the orb’s revelation carries conceptual cost yet Elara’s agency is passive (touch and receive). One tightening beat: the key reveals the staircase, narrowing options. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (to sense why houses “feel alive”) tightens once when displaced objects fuse into a single charged tableau whose reconfiguring silence costs Elias his former detachment; pressure and cost are legible without external contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake: serum’s fragility vs. village lives. Pressure tightens when Liora exposes the glass weakness, forcing Elara to trade speed for safety. Cost is visible in delayed cure and personal doubt. One clear escalation beat meets scope.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether she can embody perpetual motion by letting go—tightens once when the die falls; cost is visible and legible. No escalation escalation cycles, but the single deepening is sufficient for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—rousing a lost kindness—tightens once when the daydream forces her to paint for the vanished city; the price is her surrender of solitary refuge to an open-ended guardianship, visible in the dawn smog’s return.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—reviving a dying tradition—is signaled early and tightened when the honeyed bread becomes the test; the communal laughter is the earned cost/confirmation. One meaningful intensification suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—rewrite destiny—tightens when the stone awakens and the island resists. One clear escalation: the lighthouse shudders, forcing Elias to decide amid rising tide. Cost is legible but could be more viscerally paid (blood, fracture) to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—trick fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled early and tightened when Clara unbosoms. Pressure escalates via pattern accumulation rather than causal reversals; the clocks’ wild spinning marks the decisive intensification. Cost is legible in the shattering mirrors and the advisor’s softened tone.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—turn inner restlessness into harmony—is signaled early and tightened through each musical strike. One clear escalation: fractal clouds shift from threat to map, narrowing options to play or remain discordant. Cost is atmospheric rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—city’s survival—signaled early. Escalation tightens once: gate closed → tunnel opens → mandate issued. Agency is Elara’s decision to descend and accept task; cost is deferred, not yet visceral. Pressure coherent under Causal lens; no false reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—“rescue truth”—is front-loaded. A single tightening arrives in the basement discovery, narrowing the quest from search to review. Price is conceptual (burden of knowledge) rather than specific object lost; still legible under lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—rescuing drowned dreams—tightens through each stone Elias lifts; the journal entry confirms stakes but does not escalate them further. One meaningful deepening occurs when the mosaic glows, forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is visible (raw hands) yet not leveraged to foreclose any future path; the price feels incidental rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering honest origins—is signaled early and tightens when the blackout strips distractions. One meaningful deepening occurs as the map reveals the library as gateway. Cost is legible (isolation, irreversible passage opening), but the pressure curve is gentle rather than sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake—will Kael keep using craft to evade grief?—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: basilica reveals the shadow was self-built armor, forcing the unfolding. Cost is the relinquished shield of denial. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict escalates under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—finding usable potential after annihilation—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once: from passive observation to active “hunt” for pattern in chaos. The cost is the irrevocable loss of her former self, legible in the dress and the silence after the breakers click back on.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dominant stake—decode belonging via chip—is signaled early. Pressure rises only by location change; no narrowing options or resource loss. Agency is present but frictionless; luck (drone finds every piece) undercuts escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—can Elias bear the next false line?—is signaled at paragraph one and tightens to a visible trade-off once he drops the watch hand. The driftwood hunt offers micro reversals of hope then deeper guilt; escalation is coherent under causal lens. Moment-to-moment pressure would sharpen further if refusal carried a concrete consequence beyond internal regret.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—breaking the cycle of blame—is signaled early and tightened through the dialogue’s micro-turn: Kael’s refusal → tentative acceptance. The cost is the mutual vulnerability of the handshake over the drawer pull.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.7)
    Dominant stake emerges—carry empathy despite pain—yet pressure escalates only in soft interior beats, not tactics or jeopardy. Ball-drop tightens focus momentarily, but no hard trade-off is paid on the page; cost is announced, not enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single clear stake—restore a bond—progressively narrowed by the guardian’s warning that it must be re-invented, not restored. Pressure shifts from external quest to internal renunciation, tightening options until she lets the old shape burn.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—recovering lost moments—is signaled early and tightened by the Tower/Chariot draw. The saucer’s glow provides the single deepening beat that reweights options. Cost is legible: the missed hand-tracing becomes an irreversible absence. Agency is internal (attention/renunciation) rather than external action, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake—unlock the dimension to save humanity—is signaled early. Pressure tightens once when the tear merges with the core, but the cost is aesthetic light, not a felt forfeiture. Escalation is present yet mild.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—“understand the texture of transformation”—is signaled early and tightened when the hush redirects her. The detour forces a single meaningful choice: release the bugs. Cost is conceptual (loss of her “most cherished possession”) but not viscerally felt; no concrete forfeiture alters later tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—awakening the populace without bloodshed—is signaled early and tightened when Thorne blocks her path. The blackout intensifies pressure, the key retrieval narrows options, and the ignition exacts the social cost of exposure. One meaningful turn suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding the sacred patterns—is signaled early and tightened through each rock placement. The final leap of eels and the new unreadable sequence crystallize the cost: knowledge gained only reveals deeper mystery. One tightening is sufficient and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—freedom vs. self-censorship—signaled early. Pressure tightens when map reveals personal scars; cost is exposure. Agency is Elara’s choice to write. Escalation is one deepening, sufficient for length. No external antagonist; internal conflict suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—uncovering the overture—tightens once when Elias reframes the quest from destination to process. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral; pressure is coherent under Accumulative lens. No visible forfeiture or tool loss, limiting upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.6)
    Dominant stake—beauty from anarchy—signaled early. Middle deepening: letters prove words can survive war, tightening Elias’s resolve. Yet external pressure (prison authorities, vagrant danger, resource limits) stays off-page; escalation is interior and declarative. Final stance crystallizes, but options were never narrowed by an antagonistic force.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—whether to accept or rewrite fate—escalates through the reel immersion, which forces a stance crystallization. One meaningful tightening occurs when the compasses still and the clock restarts; cost is legible in her changed melody.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes are declared—memory loss via monsoon—but the monsoon arrives only after the seed is planted, so pressure never escalates. The creature’s riddle is a single beat of tension, not a narrowing of options. Agency is limited to answering correctly; no trade-off is dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightens once: the compass settles, the lace instructs, and the letters force Elias to voice regret, foreclosing his search by transmuting it into release. Cost is the dissolution of the letters and the abandonment of the compass. Pressure is coherent but singular; no secondary escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (meaning in decay) tightens via dust's responsiveness, but escalation lacks visible price during buildup; cost remains conceptual at closure ("strip away needless drama") without tactical sacrifice shown on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency (retracing via frost patterns), but the escalation lacks visible price paid mid-journey; the apprentice's captivity revelation deepens knowledge without altering Elara's immediate tactics or stamina.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through one meaningful deepening: Kael’s pattern discovery transforms silence from void to canvas. Cost is legible in "no longer an emptiness," though escalation lacks visceral physical toll under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake (find light within depths) signaled early but remains abstract—no concrete pressure like time limits or physical danger. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening; fragment search feels procedural, not tightening. Cost is purely emotional without visible trade-offs during the quest.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten when the pendant’s glow forces Elara to follow sparks toward the alcove, narrowing options from passive observation to active pilgrimage. The cost—confronting past-life failure—is legible in the "warmth spread through her chest" that resolves the opening "trembling," though escalation lacks one deeper micro-choice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding time's texture) signals early but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; the maze's shifts feel externally imposed rather than testing Elara's choices. Cost (fragment's dissolution) is conceptual yet insufficiently visceral for the stakes. Pressure accumulates texturally but forecloses no live option with on-page trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (seeds vs. wall collapse) tightens via protagonist's agency decoding piano keys; cost escalates through chains hindering ladder descent. One meaningful pressure point suffices, but pursuers' late arrival slightly softens opposition's causal weight.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single meaningful deepening when forge activates, reweighting trust-breaking sound with felt cost. "Cells divide" timeframe is ornamental without altering tactics, limiting escalation beyond one valid intensification under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Lira’s agency: flower reinterpretation directly triggers Elara’s appearance, narrowing options from theft to stewardship. Cost (shedding identity) is felt in "thief no longer," though "soul" abstraction slightly dilutes visceral weight of the jar’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through glass fragility metaphor: "cracks where light enters" reweights vulnerability cost. Agency in "abandon fear of unknown" forecloses control path. Pressure tightens via ice melting but secondary stake ("safe zones") lacks concrete on-page test.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen via Elara’s agency (deciphering notes), with visible cost in "mirrors began to crack"; escalation under Accumulative lens reweights identity theft as conceptual loss.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (mapping endless night) tightens via density increase, but no tangible cost is paid—only implied conceptual weight. Escalation driven by oracle’s agency, yet "felt cost" stays abstract despite the star’s vanishing.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (thought origins) signaled early, but escalation relies on program exposition rather than protagonist agency. Music-driven deepening reweights knowledge, yet cost remains abstract ("quiet certainty") without tangible trade-off. Pressure coherent but tightening lacks felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (thawing mistrust) tighten through Elara’s doodle-sketching agency under Accumulative lens, but cost remains emotionally diffuse; Kian’s "It’s beautiful" lacks palpable consequence beyond dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (proving gardens know gardeners) remains abstract, never tested through action. Polishing ritual lacks escalation—it's repetitive with no narrowing of options. Conceptual cost (self-doubt) felt but not earned via agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes signaled early with one tightening (lever-pull → system failure), but escalation diminishes protagonist agency post-inciting incident; cost visible in system failures but emotional price remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (unraveling the ghost’s code) tighten through accumulating sensory pressure under Accumulative lens, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the ghost guides Clara’s actions. Cost (vanishing, dissolved program) charges the final image yet feels emotionally resolved without trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (truth’s weight) tightens through illustration’s distortion and wanderer’s dialogue, but escalation leans on thematic exposition ("truths are like roots") rather than protagonist agency; cost legible via sorrow-to-resilience shift yet feels narratively assisted.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (truth-seeking) tightens via valve wheel discovery, but escalation relies on atmospheric pressure rather than protagonist-driven choices; whispers-to-screams shift lacks tactical consequence for Mara.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes ("fragile balance she sought to preserve") deepen meaningfully when the swan trembles, but the journey lacks protagonist-driven escalation—Lira follows the map passively, with no trade-off (e.g., risking her journals) to narrow options or heighten cost.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (fear vs wonder) tightens through eclipse deepening, narrowing Finn's options as telescope becomes obsolete. Cost is felt in his "shift" but lacks concrete forfeiture; pressure relies slightly on coincidence (eclipse timing) rather than pure protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (restoring dreams) escalate through Elara’s agency discovering scrolls and performing the ritual, narrowing options meaningfully. But the cost remains abstract—"weight of centuries" lacks visceral, character-specific consequence to elevate higher.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake ("unravel mysteries") signaled early but never tested concretely—pressure doesn’t cohere as Li Wei’s journey faces zero opposition. Tightening (microdot touch) is coincidental, not driven by agency; cost ("stillness") is felt but not legible on the page per band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes signaled early with meaningful deepening via rhetorical escalation. Pressure accumulates under Accumulative lens through increasingly pointed questions. Visible cost legibility weakens band entry; no tangible forfeiture alters protagonist's state.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (completing symphony before exhaustion) tightens via dawn's approach, narrowing options to a single climactic act. Pressure grows coherently under Accumulative lens through sensory intensification, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the writer reacts to time rather than driving choices, weakening cost legibility despite visible collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (conquering self-labyrinth) tightens via timeline visions, with the tablet’s dimming serving as felt cost. Escalation lacks agency-driven narrowing of options—visions accumulate passively—failing the band guardrail for visible price charging the final image under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency (reversing songs), but escalation lacks one visible price altering tactics; the "faint rustle of turning seasons" signals time pressure yet never constrains her choices within the cavern.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten credibly as Elias infiltrates the compound (e.g., guard patrols narrowing options), but early conflict lacks teeth—the "follower" vanishes without altering tactics, weakening initial pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes escalate via Elias’s agency: fear of scents (established early) tightens through memory visions until uncorking becomes the only path forward. Cost is visceral—years of emotional suppression paid in tears—with no coincidence resolving tension.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate via pattern recognition narrowing options (bound/drift/uncover), but the mirror's "impossible choice" lacks visceral cost—the emotional price remains abstract despite "heart pounding," missing tangible forfeiture in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (filling hush) tightens via violin playing, narrowing options to storytelling. Agency-driven escalation but cost remains conceptual ("weight of memories") without tangible forfeiture. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Elara realizes Kael's "half truth," with the dissolution beat's "faint heartache" constituting visible cost; however, escalation lacks protagonist agency—the transformation happens *to* her rather than through decisive action under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (will connection risk pay off?) tightens through mail-checking anxiety to the meeting. Agency-driven escalation: drafting the letter narrows options by exposing vulnerability. Cost—emotional exposure—viscerally felt in the locket’s final lightness.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (artistic flatness) signaled early with "time slipping through fingers"; deepening via pool’s "tapestry" realization narrows options. Cost visible in temporary access ("giant’s nap ending"), though external pressure remains light for Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's agency—deciphering mosaic narrows options from curiosity to perilous understanding—but cost stays conceptual (unheeded warning) rather than visceral, limiting emotional punch at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (becoming visible) tightens through cache discovery, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure shifts. Pipe chase descent deepens atmosphere without altering tactics, missing visceral cost legibility at peak.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (threshing meaning from chaos) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure under Accumulative lens. The exchange resolves the quest through external intervention (old woman), with cost felt only abstractly in the brooch's absence—not through Elara's agency narrowing options or enduring visible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (proving her gift) tightens via the pearl's discovery, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the cave's sentience emerges coincidentally, not from Elara's choices; cost (identity loss) is legible yet under-earned by her passive merging.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (recovering lost stories) tightens via valve's activation, but pressure escalation lacks visible cost until closure; agency in playing the valve forecloses exile's silence, though secondary cost remains conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stake crystallizes as confronting inner mysteries to unravel external ones; midnight timing tightens decisions visibly. Cost is clear in "no longer feared the mysteries" shift, though arrow path escalation leans slightly convenient under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (filling void) signaled early but pressure never escalates meaningfully; tile's "urge" faces no resistance. Whale migration timeframe is decorative rather than live clock (no "tide rising" urgency). Climax lacks trade-off—gains connection without visible cost scaling to length.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Protagonist agency tightens pressure: Elyr’s magnetic experimentation narrows options toward mutiny. Cost is unmistakable ("dimensions colliding") and shapes final stance. Dominant stake (void vs. purpose) signaled by paragraph 1.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Clara’s agency: "waiting actively" evolves into speaking truth that forecloses asylum path. Cost is visceral in father’s "tentative" grip. Political asylum lacks concrete tactical impact, slightly muting escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (collecting histories) signaled early, but pressure never coheres—the "different" hum creates no genuine conflict or choice; under Accumulative lens, density increase fails to reweight stakes with tangible cost escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming erased humanity) remains thematic rather than viscerally tested; escalation relies on convenient discovery (container archive) without protagonist agency tightening options or imposing tangible cost beyond realization.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (identity vs. erasure) tighten through graffiti discoveries, but Lira’s agency lacks protagonist-driven escalation; Vorin’s opposition feels external coincidence. Cost legible in "fight far from over" but not viscerally felt in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (preserving history) tightens via the dawn deadline, forcing Elara’s endurance with felt cost. However, escalation leans on external pressure (terraforming schedule) rather than protagonist agency—the "outlast" action is passive, missing a pivotal micro-choice that would heighten the trade-off under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake ("find where rivers begin") tightens meaningfully when vibration under ice alters tactics; agency drives discovery. Cost (emotional understanding) is legible but slightly abstract; could deepen physical tradeoffs during the trek.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake ("shared balance") stays abstract without concrete test; escalation relies on atmospheric shifts rather than Elias's agency. Two distinct non-closure issues (abstract stakes + weak pressure) trigger -1.5 accumulation cap.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant oxygen stake tightens meaningfully, but "gathered hush" concept never actively pressures choices—it remains atmospheric rather than altering tactics under Accumulative lens escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (redeem name vs truth) tightens through journal discovery; agency-driven deepening reconfigures options. Cost unmistakable in "no longer son of boy who cried wolf" crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (debt repayment) tightens through bead's awakening, but "mournful elation" lacks concrete cost escalation; spirits' chorus deepens stakes yet resolution remains conceptual rather than viscerally paid.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake ("ruin to reverence") is declared but never concretely tested; pressure remains diffuse ("whispers of voices") without a single on-page reversal or trade-off that forecloses options. "Doubt and fatigue" lack tangible manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through purposeful wandering method, but pressure lacks tangible friction; orchard's assistance reduces earned cost despite cyclical time motif intensifying meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes ("time running out") tighten meaningfully when coordinates point to the mailbox, but tension deflates instantly upon successful retrieval. No visible cost or tactical shift occurs during the climax, weakening escalation under Causal lens despite early urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through knowledge reweighting (flame as safeguard), but escalation relies on Lira’s exposition rather than Elara’s agency; conceptual cost feels earned yet insufficiently embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes escalate via message density ("You were never too late" to personal letter); agency drives path but cost remains abstract—regret transformed to "bridge" without felt sacrifice, weakening Accumulative pressure's conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten via Accumulative lens: coral's glow intensifies with each deciphered phrase, narrowing Elara's path to action. Agency fully protagonist-driven (decoding choices). Cost visible in enduring numbness. Minor flaw: "shared anxieties" concept stated but not dramatized as active pressure until final line, losing 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (artistic joy) tightens through Lira’s active engagement with film, but pressure relies slightly on convenience (fog "guiding" her); cost of drained passion is legible yet not viscerally dramatized during peak escalation at the projector.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (certainty vs curiosity) tightens via coin’s animation, but conceptual cost lacks tangible pressure. "Cage" metaphor reweights options cleanly though felt cost remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (Lexicon survival) tighten when Krane reveals infiltration, but escalation lacks tangible cost: Elias never weighs sacrifice against action, and the "heavier world" feels abstract rather than altering tactics under Situational pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes ("centuries of longing") deepen through sensory accumulation, yet pressure lacks tangible escalation—doubt threatens but never concretely impedes her lullabies; the cost remains conceptual (weight of longing) without measurable tactical alteration, weakening the Accumulative lens's payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Elara's singing agency under Accumulative lens; cost unmistakable in shattered wind chime and "heart heavy with foxglove regret," reweighting preservation stakes through visceral loss.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single stake (restoring trust) tightens via three vows, narrowing options to "fear" admission. Cost is visible in trembling hands and Kael's conflicted expression. Inkwell's symphony resolves conflict through coincidence rather than Elara's agency, undermining accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (harmonizing values) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful narrowing of options; pressure grows texturally rather than through Elias's agency-driven choices under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through dust-mote mapping, but "songs are in the dust" letter resolves via coincidence rather than protagonist agency under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (threshold meaning) tightens through logbook decoding, with agency in leaving it as tangible cost; "necessary distances" concept remains thematic rather than altering physical tactics on terrace.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (belonging vs. survival) deepen through rhythm realization, but alarm escalation lacks causal buildup; pressure shift feels unearned as prior serenity faces no organic threat, weakening cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Lira's escalating frustration ("sand slipping through fingers") to the emotional pivot point. Cost is legible in memory's fleeting return, but "before memory faded" remains abstract without tactical time pressure—sufficient for length but limits escalation depth.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (monotony vs. wonder) is signaled early but lacks meaningful escalation; Elias succeeds effortlessly without trade-offs. Pressure deepens through crowd reactions, but no on-page tightening choice narrows options or alters tactics. Cost ("work far from over") is legible but not dramatized as a consequence of agency. Strong accumulation falls short of 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    Pressure tightens through sensory narrowing (wind's song to heavy air) and Lira's escalating physical risk (quill hovering mid-verse), culminating in stance crystallization. Cost is visible: the garden's exhale and blooming flowers reweight the cosmic verse's survival.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes ("shift coming") remain abstract; escalation relies on atmospheric deepening rather than protagonist-driven pressure—no narrowing of options or trade-off that alters tactics with visible cost under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (guilt vs. purpose) tightens through feather visions that reconfigure pain as connection. Agency is clear—Elias's reflection drives the shift—but escalation lacks one visible tactical cost (e.g., physical tremor during decision) to reach 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through environmental pressure (tide threatening patterns), narrowing options to endurance/renunciation. The cost—erased creations—is visible and felt, driving the deepening where "revitalizing" becomes the thematic core. Agency manifests in deliberate recreation, though the tide's role edges toward coincidence in resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through sensory density (hum of history → chorus of dreams), but cost remains conceptual; legacy burden tightens options yet lacks visible forfeiture during the chamber revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes signaled early; pressure tightens via three-note structure. But escalation lacks protagonist agency—the mirrors "surrender" passively when bells toll, reducing Elara’s role to catalyst rather than active resolver. Cost (heartbeat) is visible but not earned through tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving extinct birds) tightens as cracks align and depression is found, narrowing options to one sanctuary. Cost is felt in her "fractured grace" realization, but external conflict (drought consequences) remains aftermath rather than viscerally tested on-page pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (awakening city) signaled early, but escalation lacks teeth—no near-failure during thread-untangling to raise cost. Pressure deepens via thread vibrations harmonizing, yet consequences feel abstract ("city stirred" lacks visceral impact). Moral calculus between peace and truth underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes clear but conflict static—no escalation under Accumulative lens; argument's emotional cost remains abstract without viscerally felt trade-offs during the reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving vanishing beauty) tightens via monarch scarcity, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the "uninterrupted cadence" pressure manifests as environmental observation rather than forcing Elara's tangible tactical shift or visible loss beyond emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes declared but untested; pressure grows via time dilation ("hours into days") not protagonist agency. No tightening choice—reconfiguring braids is procedural, not tactical trade-off with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake ("seal a covenant") is declared but never concretely tested; Kael faces no resistance beyond dim lighting. Escalation collapses when the tile is found too easily (hidden compartment), and decryption lacks cost—no sacrifice or trade-off during constellation alignment despite "leap of faith" setup.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s cellular memory technique; Kael’s shift from scoffing to asking "How do I start?" shows protagonist-driven escalation under hybrid lens; cost legible in his "raw" voice and lifted burden.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (erasing boundaries) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—breathing method succeeds effortlessly without narrowing options or visible cost during the act itself.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (bridging generational wisdom via vows) tighten when she reinterprets breach as "necessary shedding," narrowing options to renewal. Cost (regret transforming to hope) is legible but lacks visceral weight; escalation leans slightly passive via environmental response rather than protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes ("nonlinear inheritance") signaled early but escalation passive—woman's exposition resolves tension rather than protagonist's agency. Conceptual cost (new responsibility) felt but not visibly paid; no tactical alteration despite "forbidden knowledge" motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten through physical obstacles, but time collapse urgency never tests Elara's values. Cost remains abstract despite "weight" line; no tangible forfeiture alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation driven by agency: reading threads deepens knowledge, leading to Lyra's voice tightening options; cost ("for the first time, she felt whole") legible at climax. Vagueness of "what was lost" slightly weakens pressure coherence under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes signaled early ("translate confusion into clarity"), escalation through textural density (seal labyrinth → rope hum). But protagonist agency passive: realization ("symbols matched") drives action, not active problem-solving. No narrowing of options or trade-offs—braiding proceeds unimpeded. Conceptual cost (burden of uncovered stories) felt but not dramatized through on-page forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten when storm "strongest here," but escalation relies on convenient magic (stone hums, cracks glow) rather than Lira's agency. Cost ("body weary") is present but disconnected from tactical shifts—no trade-offs or irreversible losses narrow her options meaningfully before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (preserving collective memory) tighten meaningfully via shadow distortions revealing hidden truths, but escalation lacks visceral felt cost beyond Elara’s internal burden; fog vision sequence deepens knowledge without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through density (chants→chorus, petals→mosaic) under Accumulative lens, but pressure lacks visible cost: Lira’s success feels unearned as despair dissolves without tangible sacrifice beyond abstract "battle far from over."

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (validating tangential method) tightens through cicada's transformation, but "pause in conversation" timeframe lacks live-clock pressure; cost is conceptual yet unmistakable in metamorphosis realization.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.0)
    Single dominant stake (freedom vs gilded hush) tightens meaningfully: gravity inversion timeframe forces irreversible choice with visible cost (permanent internal shift); pressure escalates through Elara's agency alone.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven by Elias's agency: vial's turbulence forces course correction toward quiet sectors, deepening the dominant stake (Mira's turmoil vs. silence). The indigo shift at prismatic towers reweights emotional pressure, with cost unmistakable in "for the first time in weeks, her anxiety unravel."

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (find stairway before sunrise) tightens at the sealed archway, forcing symbol-sequence problem-solving. Yet sunrise timeframe lacks active constraint—it’s declared but never tightens tactics, muting cost legibility despite the earned conceptual resolution at the throne.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (sanctuary’s survival) are clear and cost visible (broken scar), but escalation lacks protagonist-driven deepening—Lira merely channels existing strength without adapting tactics as darkness encroaches. Pressure tightens once via the ring’s activation, but agency feels passive against the threat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (translating pressure into diamonds) tightens through Elara's agency activating the machine, but the cost—"rebuild what was lost"—remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through density increase in standing wave sequence; conceptual cost unmistakable but lacks visible price altering tactics (e.g., no physical toll from transition); agency fully protagonist-driven under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes in internal conflict (withdrawal vs. engagement) deepen via program's vibration, but pressure coherence falters—reality shifts feel atmospheric rather than tightening tactics; conceptual cost felt yet insufficiently viscerally anchored per band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (uncovering humanity in bureaucracy) tightens via button/ribbon discovery, but pressure lacks escalation—no obstacle tests her resolve. The "method" arrives late without prior struggle, muting the cost. Agency feels passive; coincidence (dust footprints) complicates but doesn’t raise stakes meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. propaganda) tightens when enforcers force broadcast adaptation. But cost remains abstract ("couldn't outrun them" stated not embodied); no tradeoff alters tactics beyond the single solution.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes (hushing prophecy) escalate through grotto's reactive transformations, but saxophonist's agency is passive—pressure builds via environmental responses (mist swirling, atrium spinning) rather than his tactical choices, diluting the accumulative lens's protagonist-driven intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes remain internalized—folklore's prophecy lacks concrete pressure; moonstone's "key" revelation escalates knowledge but no visible cost manifests until closure's abstract shift.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes remain abstract ("uncertainty") without concrete testing; protagonist passively follows compass rather than wrestling with the core conflict. "Coincidence becomes pattern" insight lacks causal pressure from earlier choices.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (understanding names' weight) deepens via visions, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the "exploring limits" method isn't dramatized in attempts, making visions feel passive rather than earned through her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation via Elara’s agency (harp intensifying) reweights the stake with visible cost, but conflict lacks resistance—the figure never opposes her, preventing the tightening needed for 8.8+ band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (mathematics of mercy) tightens through her deepening realization, narrowing options from formula-seeking to accepting purpose in pain. Cost is visceral in the mask strap’s release—a live option foreclosed with emotional weight—driven solely by her agency under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (recovering histories) tightens meaningfully via map discovery, narrowing options to tower journey. Agency-driven escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds, but cost remains conceptual (untold stories' weight) without visceral on-page forfeiture beyond emotional resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by Marcus' agency (dust analysis → climbing) under causal lens; cost unmistakable in "warmth spread... burden lifted" with persistent stakes in final line about recurring cracks.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (mastering reality's patterns) tightens through descent and library revelation. Cost is legible ("work far from over") but lacks visceral punch; conceptual weight sufficient for length under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten when entering Hall, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the storm happens *to* her. Cost ("bittersweet triumph") is stated not felt; "wounds unhealed" lacks on-page embodiment. One tightening suffices but cost legibility weakens high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (restore stolen light) tightens meaningfully when tether discovery forces the journey. Agency in freeing—not repairing—the box narrows options, but the cost (spent stone) feels emotionally shallow for high-band elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation ("waters shimmered," "resonant hush"), yet pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; the compass loss resolves the quest coincidentally.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (understanding slide's secret) tightens via sensory escalation (pulsing light, hidden passage), but pressure isn't Mara-driven—storm "stills as if holding its breath," chamber "erupts" without her agency. Cost remains abstract ("profound purpose") rather than visible forfeiture; no tangible price (time/tool/stamina) alters her tactics or charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes signaled early ("truth in tension"), escalation via ritual density. But pressure driven by waiting, not agency—entity appears coincidentally as doubt creeps in. Visible cost (hours of labor) insufficiently deepens conceptual stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: "conceive" action drives escalation from bottle glow to physical revival under Accumulative lens, with visible cost in her refusal to stay.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure accumulates via discoveries (shaving, symbols, recording) under Accumulative lens, narrowing options to one path; cost is the garden’s sigh and inherited burden, legible in "her work was far from over."

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.7)
    Stakes (restore balance via vortex) are clear early, but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening—reopening relies on coincidence ("low hum vibrating"), not protagonist choices. "Decreasing entropy" method remains abstract exposition; no visible price paid that alters tactics or charges the final image under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes ("whispers vs. noise") signaled early but pressure lacks tightening; anomaly discovery feels coincidental rather than protagonist-driven escalation. No meaningful trade-off when pulling rope—gains wisdom without visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure tightens through Accumulative lens via lantern’s intensifying glow and constellation alignment, narrowing options to empathetic surrender; cost legible in "strength passed to her" as conceptual price for internal stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes lack escalation under Causal lens; covenant restoration feels inevitable. No narrowing of options during ritual (e.g., water failing/melody faltering). Cost ("weight of unspoken words") is atmospheric but not viscerally tested in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (fixing time) is signaled early, but escalation isn’t driven by Elara’s agency—Thaddeus provides solutions. Cost remains abstract ("profound sense of purpose") without tangible forfeiture, failing band guardrail for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully around "beauty in incomplete," but the wanderer's sudden appearance and unexplained string-cutting rely on coincidence that complicates rather than escalates pressure under Accumulative lens; cost lacks visceral specificity despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.2)
    Time pressure (six months) remains abstract without altering tactics or creating trade-offs; no deepening of knowledge narrows options meaningfully. Stakes are clear but escalation lacks coherent pressure under Accumulative lens—discoveries unfold linearly without complication. Cost of mortality is visible but not dramatized as narrowing Elias's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (understanding homecoming) is clear, but pressure lacks meaningful escalation; dusty footprints and pilgrim presence complicate without raising cost or narrowing Elara's options under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (healing land) signaled early but remains abstract—no concrete test of commitment. Pressure never tightens; bird calls guide without opposition. Cost ("heavy memories") is emotional but not dramatized through action, failing to alter tactics as required.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (solitude vs. connection) deepen through Elias's agency fitting the cylinder, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; pressure comes passively from the object rather than active choices that narrow options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (amending sky) clear and pressured through chess game, but escalation feels procedural; the cost of personal transformation isn't viscerally woven into the physical climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (authenticity vs. performance) deepen through the walking sequence, yet pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; Kael’s benevolent guidance removes friction, making the resolution feel unearned rather than actively chosen under constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via accumulative pressure (stone’s pulse → crackling air → roaring thunder), but agency feels passive ("letting her mind drift"); the cost ("quiet strength") remains conceptual rather than viscerally paid in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through tapestry decoding, but cost remains internal/emotional; no tangible loss alters tactics beyond the psychological shift at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes ("price of forgiveness") signaled early, escalation via mist density/poetic urgency, but pressure driven by spire not protagonist agency. Cost ("surrendering a piece of herself") legible but not embodied in choices—lacks visible price altering tactics per 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (identity obliteration) tighten accumulatively: sea’s hiss → gears groaning → workshop shuddering. Elara’s agency drives the climax (pressing charm, narrating), but resolution leans on environmental calming (coincidence), slightly diluting earned causality under the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (timeless creation vs. isolation) deepens via detour, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the boulder is coincidence, not choice. Cost ("lighter heart") is felt yet abstract; no visible price altering tactics like seashell's "impermanence" lesson. Band guardrail unmet: tightening forecloses isolation path but price doesn't charge final image concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (proving whispers > shouts) tighten through Elias’s agency (following the beckoning figure), but escalation lacks a visceral test; the heat wave’s end resolves external pressure too neatly, muting the cost of his internal shift until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes signaled early ("navigate geography of loss"), deepening when beacon calls first traveler. Agency-driven escalation via building, but cryptic calls undermine causality—they "guide" without cost or struggle. Cost legible in cyclical burden, yet resolution feels frictionless despite high-band pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the eye "occludes control," forcing Elias' ritual agency; cost is unmistakable in the "lifeless gray" eye and lifted weight, though the virus aftermath could deepen immediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (decoding the gesture) are signaled early but escalation falters—finding the journal resolves the mystery through coincidence without protagonist-driven tightening. Cost ("strange peace") feels abstract; no visible trade-off alters Elias's tactics, leaving pressure underdeveloped despite atmospheric tension.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (purpose vs directionlessness) tightens through archway crossing, but mystical vision resolves conflict externally. Cost (end of loneliness) is legible though not viscerally paid in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (capturing presence) tightens through ritual's sensory escalation; protagonist agency drives the glow-touch transformation. Cost legible in irreversible perceptual shift ("air felt richer"), though passive object behavior ("shell began to glow") slightly dilutes causal pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (envy vs. acceptance) tightens through deepening, not reversal: scroll’s message forces trade-off between past selves and present. Cost is unmistakable—"weight lifting like a fog"—and Elara’s agency drives escalation toward crystallized stance without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stake ("unveil ordinary miracles") signaled early but pressure never tightens; Mira's exposition replaces earned escalation. Cost (Elara's perspective shift) is felt but lacks tactical alteration—no narrowing of options per Accumulative lens requirements for high band.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes escalate via sensory density (rain tapping, quill shimmering), but the single tightening—breath control reversing crystallization—feels internally driven without sufficient external pressure compounding her anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (reconnection before orchard loss) tightens via "hush before cutting" timeframe, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the bottle "guides her hand," making resolution feel passive rather than earned through choice.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    Stakes remain abstract ("cosmic illusions") without concrete on-page tests. Witness's agency evaporates at climax—dictionary acts autonomously—violating "major turns result from protagonist’s decisions" rule; no visible price paid for unity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes deepen through density accumulation, but agency passive—revelation happens *to* Elias. No trade-offs or narrowing options; conceptual cost insufficient for high-band entry per band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (boundary philosophy) signaled early, but escalation passive—figure hands mushroom; no protagonist-driven tightening. "Footprints" deepening changes knowledge, yet pressure lacks active trade-offs. Cost felt (worldview shift) but not visibly paid in tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Loneliness vs connection stake tightens via accumulating calls, each narrowing Eli’s options until dialing becomes inevitable. Cost (dissolved estrangement) is felt in final posture shift, driven by his agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes (preserve stories) signaled early but pressure never tightens—Mara’s exposition eliminates conflict without trade-offs or visible cost. "Gently thorough" trait isn’t tested under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes clear (cure for loneliness) but escalation passive; clock transformation via object contact, not agency. No visible price paid during change (e.g., effort, sacrifice). "Catalyzed" action driven by coincidence, not earned pressure under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten credibly as musical notes intensify, but internal conflict lacks interwoven friction—Elara's "quiet blaze" shows commitment without visible struggle against doubt, diluting the cost of emotional vulnerability at the stillpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (fixing anomaly) tightens through time-fragment collision, but escalation lacks meaningful resistance—void shifts passively to her presence without compounding cost before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through "mapping silence" escalation, but "disrupt" goal lacks concrete opposition; cost ("she was remembered—if only by herself") feels earned yet insufficiently pressured by the harbor's stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract ("rescue promise") with zero on-page conflict or resistance; no tightening of options occurs as clues solve themselves. Declared stakes never face concrete test, violating band guardrails for 8.0+—escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure under any lens.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen via lagoon's hum intensifying the entangled memories conflict, but escalation relies on coincidence (water responding) rather than protagonist agency. Cost ("auroral sorrow" transforming) is felt but not concretely legible as required for 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (proving whispers > shouts) signaled early via Mira’s line, but pressure lacks coherence—storm doesn’t tangibly alter tactics beyond atmosphere. Agency passive: Eli follows map until Mira hands lock. Cost remains abstract ("realized labyrinth was more than a maze"), not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (darkness/light) tightens through shutter weaving, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the guardian's passivity undermines pressure. Cost is legible ("heart less heavy") yet feels unearned by the stranger's sudden shift.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=3.9)
    No escalation or cost: the "humble rebellion" succeeds without resistance, stakes remain abstract ("second thoughts" never tested), and the town’s passive acceptance deflates conflict under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (self-acceptance) tightens via scrimshaw's dream call → island barrier → detachment choice. Cost legible in "scrimshaw gone but its essence still with her." Escalation driven by agency under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes tighten via Accumulative lens as whittling deepens resolve, but "quiet rebellion" lacks visible escalation—pressure remains static rather than narrowing options under mandate's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (transcending boundaries) lacks concrete opposition; "ban" mentioned but unused. Escalation is atmospheric (ice cracking), not driven by agency. Cost felt but not viscerally dramatized—surrender remains abstract despite transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (finding beauty without color) signaled early, but pressure doesn't deepen meaningfully; concertina's activation feels unearned coincidence, not protagonist agency. No visible price paid during escalation before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake tightens when stencil glows, but pressure isn't protagonist-driven; Elara's passivity during curtain activation undercuts escalation under Accumulative lens where attention should deepen meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (uncover engineered crash) tightens through data-card integration; pressure escalates via Mira’s confession and Elara’s analysis, with cost crystallized in "months of despair" giving way to fragile hope under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency when she recognizes "pattern of absence"; cost legible in "erosion of innocence" realization during pagoda activation, though secondary conflict lacks depth.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through Elara's agency (comparing footage, metamorphosing shadow), but opposition remains passive (colleagues' dismissal); cost feels earned yet lacks tangible tactical consequence—no live option foreclosed beyond personal epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; "shedding layers" method isn't tested through action, reducing cost immediacy despite strong thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency under accumulative lens: tunnel memories deepen knowledge (scars belong to multiple entities), narrowing options to reunion. Cost is legible ("scars on her soul began to fade"), though slightly abstract; one tightening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through Accumulative density: letters’ merging deepens the quest’s cost ("Where did this love go?"), but the conceptual price lacks the "unmistakable" on-page visibility required for 9+; agency in taking the strip forecloses passive observation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (freeing creativity) remain static; "shadowed rapture" intensifies but without narrowing options or visible price. Band guardrail violated: no tangible cost charging the final image under Accumulative lens, though aurora’s song swelling provides sufficient deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (saving archive) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. Charm use succeeds instantly; no meaningful tightening or cost until closure, where "divergence" revelation feels unearned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (insight void) tightens via Accumulative escalation—wind’s song deepens into cosmic understanding. Agency drives escalation (Eamon follows the melody), but translocation during sleep lacks trade-offs; it enables discovery without cost. Final image reweights options, yet prior stakes feel abstract until the light sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes (finding unused courage) tighten through Mara's ascent, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the ridgeway "guides" her. Ferryman resolves the climax, violating the "no coincidence" rule; cost is felt but not unmistakable on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes ("cost of safety") tighten via the bolt discovery, but the shift from silence-as-prison to silence-as-truth feels abrupt; Elias' agency in playing the piano earns the climax, yet the conceptual cost lacks visceral embodiment beyond "heavy with knowledge."

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's escalating annotations (ledger → diary → speech), with cost legible in the pretender's "frantic" tone shift; agency falters as pretender's responses feel reactive rather than driven by their own flawed choices.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stake (deciphering the atlas page’s truth) tightens through Elara’s agency—her assembly of fragments narrows options from curiosity to revelation. Cost is felt conceptual weight of historical ignorance. Escalation lacks visceral friction; alarm interruption feels procedural rather than raising stakes meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes deepen via cosmic vision, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the hum acts upon Lira rather than her choices under pressure. Cost ("defeat" feeling) established early but not viscerally paid in scene.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes (cultural restoration vs. regime) tighten when guard appears, but resolution lacks cost: plant manipulation dissolves threat effortlessly. Escalation driven by Mara’s agency, yet cost ("breathlessness") feels conceptual, not visceral or tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake (preserving memory vs. carrying pain) signaled early, single deepening (cliff slip) narrows options under Accumulative lens. Cost ("weight lift") visible but soft; agency undermined by wind coincidence. Band guardrail blocks 8.8+ due to missing tangible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding brother's death) tightens through ink's revelation, but Elara's agency feels passive during the critical turn; cost is emotional but lacks tactical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (duty vs. truth) escalates causally through seal-breaking to data theft, narrowing options to "copy or be caught"; cost legible in "surge of triumph and dread" with snow-library bearing witness, fulfilling band guardrails for 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Kael's warning forces Elara's agency (refusing flight while accepting blade); cost of compromised pacifism visibly alters her tactics (carrying sheathed blade) and reweights the final image under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes ("patterns breaking") deepen via constellation freeze, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—goddess appears coincidentally. Cost legible in emotional transliteration, yet pressure hinges on external intervention rather than Kael's choices tightening options.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate through evidence accumulation, but the journalist's fate never concretely pressures Eleanor's actions; felt cost at closure remains observational rather than experiential.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes escalate via letter discovery → writing → sealing sequence, but firmware's transition from "roar" to "mournful melody" lacks visible struggle, softening agency at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake clear but escalation lacks tangible trade-offs; mosaic rearrangement presents no narrowed options (e.g., no cost like ruined hands altering tactics) despite conceptual cost in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Mara’s agency under the accumulative lens: the coin’s color shift from "storm of blues" to "gold and green" deepens the stake (mending timelines) with visible cost (her enduring bittersweetness). Pressure coheres through sensory density, foreclosing despair with the woman’s transformation and Mara’s unresolved purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes remain abstract ("understand telepathy fallout") without concrete on-page opposition; no visible price paid during creation, rendering "fragile yet unyielding" hope conceptual but untested by actual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes tighten when fossil floats toward chamber, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Elara follows passively with no trade-offs. Cost implied (exhaustion) but not tied to fossil/chamber choice. Band guardrail for 8.8+ unmet: price doesn't charge final "promise for future" image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency—cataloging buttons tightens options until the bone button forces a stance crystallization. The felt cost (her altered perception of the air) is unmistakable, though the echo’s abstract "wisdom" slightly dilutes visceral stakes despite strong Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes ("finding unused courage") remain abstract without tangible escalation; snow codes present no meaningful risk (no failed deciphering, time pressure). Resolution via letter introduces convenient external solution, violating "coincidence may complicate but not resolve" rule.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (uncovering palimpsest promise) is clear, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening—the ticking gutters deadline creates artificial urgency resolved coincidentally by the figure's appearance. Cost (time's passage) is felt yet not earned through meaningful choice.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes ("searching for something lost") stay abstract without escalation—no narrowing of options or visible price paid beyond emotional revelation, violating the "meaningful tightening" mandate; coincidence (lockmaster’s arrival) complicates but doesn’t deepen the central conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Elena's agency as the library tests her resolve (shelves closing in, air growing heavier), culminating in the orb's irreversible integration; cost is legible in her altered physiology and role, though the "hum" escalation lacks granular pressure increments.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through knowledge reconfiguration (revealed connections), but the emotional cost of losing the talisman feels underweighted against the quest's magnitude in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (signal control) is clear, but escalation lacks causal pressure—Hank's complaint is the sole on-page tightening; community protests feel off-screen rather than narrowing options meaningfully under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten credibly as claustrophobia wars with discovery drive during passage, with visceral cost ("shoulders brushing walls"), but spatial mutiny's rules remain abstract—pressure grows through sensory density rather than concrete constraint changes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (awakening empathy) tightens when figure appears with matching ribbon, escalating to Elara’s realization that quarry = "chasm between people."

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly through the ritual, but the dominant cost ("humanity's worthiness") remains abstract without concrete on-page manifestation beyond Elara's internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes remain abstract ("sculpt possibility from ashes of 'never'") without concrete cost escalation; the glass flake’s "warmth" guides the journey coincidentally rather than through Bridge-Song’s agency. Pressure tightens only at the climax when scaffold wrap layers are unraveled, but this lacks prior deepening of constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the scavenger forces Elias to defend the train’s stories, crystallizing his shift from curiosity to preservation. Cost remains conceptual (accepting cyclical paths) but lacks a tangible forfeiture—e.g., discarding one bill to symbolize release.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (decoding inscriptions to heal) tightens through constellation revelation, but escalation relies on external star patterns rather than protagonist-driven pressure shifts. Cost ("acknowledging burdens") is legible yet internalized without concrete trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Eira’s escalating surrender ("unbent further, defenses crumbling"), narrowing options to vulnerability. Cost is unmistakable in the whispered "I failed" amid surging energy. Agency-driven deepening under Accumulative lens works, but "frozen confession" repetition slightly softens the pressure’s conceptual weight during peak escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (mend covenant) tightens via clipping’s guidance, but escalation lacks visible cost escalation—scars glow without tangible sacrifice. Agency in final placement is earned, yet prior cost remains conceptual rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake (freedom vs purpose) tightens through protagonist agency: roots’ trammel forces confrontation, her "I’ll stay" crystallizes stance with visible conceptual cost. Escalation under Accumulative lens via pattern break (roots forming tarot pattern). Minor deduction: cost feels slightly abstract until final line.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes stay abstract ("purpose") without concrete cost manifestation; "wrest" realization deepens knowledge but lacks pressure-driven escalation—no visible trade-off like rejecting a job offer that would narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (understanding transition) is clear early, but internal conflict isn’t tested meaningfully—planting the seed requires no trade-off. Cost is felt ("void now purpose") but not dramatized; no visible price paid beyond emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (stabilizing identities) signaled early, but escalation falters—rapid fluctuations solved via convenient orb-dissolving with no tangible cost during action; conceptual cost emerges only in reflection, failing band guardrail for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through deepening: "raw ache of unfiltered memory" narrows options to facing her past. Conceptual cost legible in "weight on her chest shifted." Agency-driven under Accumulative lens, but no tangible loss shown beyond emotional reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Escalation builds through sensory density (hum syncing with shelves), but dominant stake ("find her answer") remains abstract; cost felt in leaving sanctuary yet insufficient protagonist-driven narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (violin's power vs. Dominion) tightens through coffee-stain vision and scouts' approach. Agency crystallizes in balcony choice with visible cost (sacrificed potential), though "empire vs. dream" moral calculus stays abstract rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s internal renunciation (“understand the stillness”) with felt cost in her trembling realization; escalation driven by pattern accumulation (static → stillness) under Accumulative lens, though traveler’s insight edges on coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (contentment source) tightens meaningfully when the hairpin reveals the map, narrowing options to pursuit. Cost—relinquishing unrest for cyclical peace—is legible in the final image, though the betrayal's impact on present stakes could deepen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes ("cloak of doubt") declared but never tested in scene; no escalation or narrowing of options. Elias faces zero opposition—deciphering chimes requires no trade-off. Dominant stake lacks visceral pressure or visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through trance-deepening escalation (ripple patterns → colleagues' faces), but cost remains abstract; "unburdened" heart lacks visceral tradeoff despite conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Eli's agency: trap narrows options to harness use or death, raising stakes from abstract quest to survival. Cost unmistakable in physical panic and thematic weight of manual method succeeding where automation failed.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake ("color of sound") lacks visceral escalation; no on-page test of commitment beyond easy acceptance. Cost remains conceptual without felt price (e.g., abandoning job/safety), weakening pressure under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (deciphering prophecy) signaled early, but pressure accumulation lacks visceral cost—distillation succeeds smoothly without narrowing options. The emotional shift feels earned yet insufficiently tied to tangible stakes escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes (meaning from loss) tighten via sensory density ("air thickened with weight of forgotten phrases"), reweighting sacrifice through crystallization; cost legible in "quiet sorrow that mirrored her own," fulfilling Accumulative escalation with protagonist-driven deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten as bell reassembly progresses, but cosmic imbalance resolution relies on near-coincidence (waves returning); Eliard’s agency drives the repair, yet the cost (ongoing work) feels abstract versus tangible trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake ("amnesia") stays abstract; no tangible consequence if Elias fails. Agency passive—follows clues rather than makes hard choices. Band guardrail fails: no visible price altering tactics, despite "surge of purpose" pseudo-cost. Pressure accumulates without narrowing options.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes ("harmonize logic and intuition") are signaled early but pressure never tightens meaningfully—the flame interruption adds mystery without raising cost. Agency isn't tested; her hesitation resolves instantly with no trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.9)
    Stakes remain abstract ("preserve trust" never tested by concrete consequence); escalation flattens into steady-state tension without narrowing options; pattern revelation solves chaos without trade-offs or lasting price.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (reclaiming fragmented soul) signaled early, but escalation relies on magical brain sentience without Kael's active decisions narrowing options; cost (conceptual rewrite) feels external rather than earned through protagonist agency under Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Dominant stake (safeguarding innovation) signals early but faces no escalation—mystery deepens without narrowing Elias's options or imposing cost. Brook's flow resolves the problem it didn't create, violating causality under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (restoring laughter) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening; "hours blurred" deepens atmosphere yet fails to narrow options or raise cost. Pressure accumulates texturally but payoff feels coincidental rather than earned through protagonist agency.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by protagonist agency through deepening realization under Accumulative lens; dominant stake (escaping failure destiny) tightens meaningfully as the crozier's redefinition narrows options, with visible cost (abandoning resurrection for transformation) legible in the sapling's emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (saving trapped souls) are clear but escalate minimally; the transient's warning is the sole opposition. Cost (Mara's weakening) is present but feels abstract—no specific loss (e.g., time, memory) alters tactics. Agency shines in rift entry but resolution relies on underdeveloped mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (texture of connection) signaled early, but escalation lacks visible price during weaving—risk of unraveling is stated but not dramatized through altered tactics until the tangle appears at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake ("protect voices") stays abstract with no tangible cost paid—finding photo requires zero struggle. Pressure flattens; pulses merely guide without narrowing options. Under Accumulative lens, density increase lacks cadence shift to reweight stakes, violating band guardrails for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate coherently under causal lens (claustrophobia → blocked vault → phase shift), but Dr. Voss's "not meant to control" warning lacks visceral immediacy; cost is internal but not sufficiently dramatized during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen through data density accumulation (ink patterns → screen alignment → shard glow), but heartbeat counting trait never incurs tactical cost during high-pressure defragmentation beat despite stated anxiety.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when the arrowhead "pulsed... pulling her toward a hidden alcove," forcing Lena's agency in the laughter choice. Cost is legible in the dormant arrowhead and heavier phone, though the cryptid's message ("lock is within you") feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned by prior beats.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (breaking free via reawakening beauty) tightens through protagonist agency: heartbeat sync decision forces trade-off (risking statue detection). Cost is legible—shell's inertness post-victory alters no future tactics but charges final image with conceptual weight under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (mending border) tightens via drone chase, but escalation leans on bottle’s magic rather than Elias’ agency; cost ("temporary respite") is legible yet lacks deeper tactical consequence for protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (silence as void vs possibility) tightens through Accumulative pressure: fragment's warmth and bells' chime narrow options toward singing. Cost is legible in reclaimed voice after "stolen" silence. Agency-driven deepening avoids coincidence; one intensification suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (recovering lost dream) signaled early but pressure never concretizes—light’s "pulsing" feels random, not escalating. No meaningful tightening; epiphany lacks visible cost. "Luminous absence" is thematic, not a felt price that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (freeing the idea) is clear, but pressure doesn’t escalate meaningfully—the vault’s "shifting locks" threat vanishes instantly with minimal cost. No visible price paid beyond abstract "everything felt different"; the tremor in her heart resolves without consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes clear but escalation passive; locket discovery solves mystery without Elara's agency. No visible price paid or tactics altered—grandmother's clues undercut protagonist-driven narrowing of options.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s deepening annotation (tea leaves shifting from "frayed letter" to "river breaking dam"), narrowing options to this single act. Cost legible in her physical strain transforming to resolve—"breath shallow" to "steady" backwards walk.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes ("preserve wonder") remain abstract; pressure never tightens beyond internal resolve. No on-page reversal or trade-off—planting succeeds effortlessly, with no cost altering tactics or foreclosing paths under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by protagonist's agency (knot resistance narrowing options); cost unmistakable in "heart heavy but at ease" as spirits find peace.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake ("whispered chapel") isn't dramatized early; pressure grows via observation but lacks visceral cost until discovery. "Map tears" timeframe remains symbolic, not tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes crystallize early: "understand the physics of letting go" versus embracing impermanence. Escalation through letter discovery deepens knowledge with cost—she releases her analytic grip. Agency is clear in the final placement, though pressure could intensify further before the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (freeing the ghost) tighten meaningfully via the lightning/thunder window, but protagonist agency falters when the ghost "directs her" fingers. The cost of the ghost's departure feels conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in Elara's physical or emotional state post-dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen cleanly through knowledge accumulation, but pressure lacks tangible antagonism. Cold/thin air noted yet never impedes actions; cost remains purely emotional without physical consequence to narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through accumulating pressure (cloud's approach, chilling air), but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the cloud drives events, Elara merely reacts; the "gravitational force drawing her" passive framing undermines Q4's 9+ requirement for self-driven cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (containing infinity) lacks meaningful friction—success feels unearned as pressure (building collapse) coincidentally complicates but doesn't transform her approach; no live option foreclosed before climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through pattern recognition: luminance shifts from abstract goal to navigational tool. Agency drives escalation (noticing dots → following beam). Cost legible in Thorne's implied sacrifice during discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes deepen via mirror distortions ("versions from different times"), but pressure escalates passively—the hall acts upon Elara rather than her choices narrowing options. The conceptual cost ("interconnectedness") feels earned yet lacks visible tradeoff like sacrificed knowledge or physical toll.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten through garden restoration (one meaningful deepening), but cost remains conceptual (Elara's dissolution) rather than tactile. No visible price paid during escalation—e.g., injuries from clearing weeds or time pressure. Agency is collective but lacks individual trade-offs scaling to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through atmospheric pressure (heavier hush, stuttering beam) and blood sacrifice; single reversal (patterns glowing) narrows options under Accumulative lens, but cost could be more viscerally tied to the puppet's repair.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten causally: the nut’s impressions narrow Elara’s options to map assembly and rescue, with the birds’ warning cries proving irrevocable cost. Agency-driven escalation meets the 9+ test through her deliberate choices under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through Elena's observation of river patterns, but the pivotal insight ("separation was not an end") lacks causal pressure—it appears suddenly rather than emerging from incremental tension.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (finding story origins) tighten through ascent, but escalation relies on environmental pressure over protagonist agency; cost (dimmed vial) legible yet emotionally abstract at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes lack escalation under accumulative lens: remorse absorption follows identical pattern each time with no rising cost or tactical shift. "Jagged etching" moment offers tension but no trade-off; she succeeds effortlessly. Agency isn't tested—pavilion's pressure never forces adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake ("resurrect abandoned dreams") is clear early, but no deepening under Accumulative lens—pressure remains static reflection without narrowing options or testing the "risky process" claim through concrete failure points.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes signaled early ("to find where forgotten combinations hide") and tighten through gravity inversion’s time pressure. Agency-driven escalation: doodle study → pool entry → crystal alignment. Conceptual cost ("responsibility") legible in final line though physical/emotional toll remains abstract. Perfect causal escalation within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (giving voice to silence) tightens through density increase in chisel strikes, but escalation lacks visible price scaling; hedgehog's presence complicates without altering tactics under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (covenant as barrier/bridge) tightens via chess sacrifice, but cost remains conceptual; escalation driven by protagonist’s translation method lacks visceral price beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes ("catalog varieties of silence") deepen meaning but stay abstract; no concrete obstacle beyond the lock. One tightening (unlocking) lacks visceral cost—emotional recovery feels unearned by prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through scent-triggered wisdom, narrowing options to surrender ambition. But escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency; the tide’s timing feels coincidental rather than pressure-coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (save planet) is clear, but pressure doesn’t escalate under Causal lens—Elara follows the arrow tip without trade-offs. Cost remains abstract future burden ("journey far from over") rather than dramatized present sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (preventing disasters through foresight) is signaled early and tightens via wind-pattern analysis, but pressure stems from reconstruction, not Elara’s agency under live threat. Cost is felt ("echo of failure to foresee"), yet the absence of immediate stakes weakens escalation—she’s observing aftermath, not confronting active danger.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (certify wonder) signaled early with emotional escalation, but chisel-timing reliance on coincidence—not protagonist agency—undermines pressure buildup; cost remains abstract despite resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through sensory pressure (canyon hush intensifying), but the flute's activation lacks tangible cost escalation—resolution feels slightly unearned despite thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: deliberate touch triggers emotional flood that forecloses intellectual distance, forcing endurance with visible cost ("stumbled back, breath ragged gasps"). The single escalation—overwhelm to clarity—reweights the dominant stake (decoding empathy) with felt conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as pendant shifts from delivery object to active choice-maker, but scholar’s revelation feels coincidental rather than earned by Elara’s agency under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes tighten through sensory density (resonance → grief revelation), but escalation feels passive—Elara receives the prism’s story rather than actively pursuing it. Conceptual cost (shattered theory) is visible, yet protagonist agency in deepening pressure remains underdeveloped.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (carrying message via silence) tightens through puzzle discoveries, narrowing options toward the bridge. Escalation driven by agency (Elara's piecing together) under Accumulative lens, though cost remains somewhat abstract until the earned "weight of sacrifice" crystallization in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes escalate causally from barter to descent, but the mine journey lacks meaningful pressure—no tangible setbacks test Eli's resolve. The "treacherous" shafts read as narrative assertion rather than dramatized obstacles narrowing options under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (truth discovery) tightens through shard transport → doppelgänger encounter → orb merger. Agency-driven escalation excels, but cost remains conceptual ("heavier than you imagine") without tangible forfeiture; the responsibility burden lacks on-page trade-offs beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' agency (rearranging stones) under Accumulative lens; cost manifests in prior emotional void ("ache") replaced by resolve, with "protect the light" demand reweighting his purpose visibly.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (control vs. cosmic purpose) tightens when the beam veers east, forcing the Herald's choice to steer deeper into fog. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency (grasping wick, directing beam), but the sea's initial "unnatural rhythm" feels coincidental rather than earned pressure under Accumulative lens, slightly diluting cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (understanding story-magnetism) tightens through woman's exchange to Kael's purpose crystallization; passive agency fits Accumulative lens but cost slightly abstract ("journey far from over").

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: deconstructing the sextant narrows options to moonlight-dependent healing, with "accumulation of lives" as visceral cost. Single deepening suffices, but "quantified sorrow" transforms tactics without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: each song fragment recovered tightens pressure through sensory deepening (tree trembling → stream harmony → lullaby feeling). Visible cost in memory fragmentation ("pieces slipping like sand") directly alters her tactics, narrowing options to intuitive feeling over rote recall.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres around Elara’s internal stake (embracing contradictions vs. hiding), deepening through her archive exploration to the blank-book revelation. Agency drives escalation—her decision to "carry the conclave’s legacy forward"—but the cost (accepting contradictions) remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt, missing the unmistakable on-page price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (finding sacred in ordinary) signaled early but lacks escalation; plaque discovery resolves tension conveniently without narrowing options or paying visible price for her hope.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen credibly as slides shift from records to "keys," but pressure lacks tangible narrowing; conceptual cost ("meaning carried forward") resonates though physical or relational forfeiture remains abstract in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Lila’s verbal confrontation narrowing options to "words and wit," but the truce’s fragility lacks felt cost until the final realization, slightly delaying escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes (understanding her glow/weather) tighten via ring’s taste signals, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven agency—the ring guides her passively, diluting pressure; one meaningful deepening suffices yet feels externally imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (mechanical repetition vs. authentic creation) deepens credibly through protagonist's realization of "chains," but escalation relies slightly on external discovery (glimmer) rather than pure agency under textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten when betrayal whispers force Elara’s leaves to wilt—a visible trade-off between truth and comfort—culminating in the bitter realization that the oasis was sacrificed, with cost unmistakable in "the truth was bitter, but it was also the key."

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (preserving wonder's color) tightens through iceberg's intensifying glisten, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation—Elara's actions follow predetermined ritual without adaptation to rising stakes. Cost ("fleeting" wonder) is legible but passive.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as fears "writhing" force miniaturization, with memory loss as undeniable cost; magnetic shift functions atmospherically but doesn’t concretely pressure tactics, missing full escalation potential under Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation driven by Clara’s agency (inserting key) narrows options under Accumulative lens, but stakes lack visceral testing; conceptual cost of "listening heals" feels earned yet misses a visible price (e.g., no risk or trade-off during the mailbox opening).

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (liberating knowledge) signaled early but never tested concretely—no moment where failure seems possible. Escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening; chamber anomaly appears coincidentally. "Surge of triumph" lacks felt cost as required for Accumulative lens, weakening pressure coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake (finding deleted memories) signaled early, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—no reversal, deepening, or trade-off during the ritual. Cost is conceptual yet felt only at closure; "air shifted" escalation feels unearned without prior friction.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (containing prophecy) tightens through one meaningful deepening (wing's glow intensifying), but escalation lacks felt consequence—prophecy's "thrashing" stays abstract without altering tactics. Cost ("vigilance") is legible yet underweighted in peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes deepen from curiosity to societal-cost awareness via Elias’ "agreed-upon lies" revelation; pressure tightens once at meteor peak but secondary conflict (seal’s purpose) lacks escalation beyond thematic exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (memory preservation vs. isolation) tightens when Elara stops resisting the flood, narrowing options to transformation. Cost is legible in the orchid’s dimmed radiance, though the figure’s exposition slightly softens the pressure escalation before the pivotal choice.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes crystallize via single tightening: hesitation to erasure forecloses bitterness with felt cost (chain breaking in soul). Agency drives escalation under accumulative lens; stalactite slowdown proves cost legibility. One decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (understanding echoes) tightens via pool vision, narrowing options to acceptance. Cost legible in melancholy's transformation, but pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; figure's revelation resolves rather than tests agency.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (giving voice to voiceless) signaled early, but pressure lacks tangible opposition—dreams yield smoothly without setbacks. One meaningful deepening (globe clearing) suffices for length, yet visible cost remains abstract versus felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (understanding hidden patterns) deepens through perception, yet pressure lacks protagonist-driven escalation; cost remains conceptual without altering Elara's immediate actions or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten effectively toward containment, but the "ancient danger" lacks visceral threat escalation; pressure narrows options credibly, yet conceptual cost outweighs felt personal sacrifice beyond fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes tighten through Elias' escalating urgency ("visions grew vivid, more urgent"), but the "variant allegiance" choice lacks visceral trade-offs—the cost ("bittersweet expression") feels abstract rather than embodied. Agency remains passive (receiving visions), weakening the pressure escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation hinges on Elias’s agency (humming, jar placement) tightening the music box’s resistance into breakthrough, but the box playing "on its own" violates "coincidence may complicate, not resolve." Dominant stake (translating lost voices) narrows options credibly until this climax flaw, muting the cost’s legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when visions force Elara's choice, and agency drives escalation ("Prove it," channeling energy). Visible cost (trembling hands, lost daylight) charges the final image, but lacks physical toll from channeling power to reach 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    Dominant stake ("patient revolution") remains abstractly declared; no on-page escalation or narrowing of options. Urgencies vanish without showing cost—Elara simply "replaces" them, violating Band guardrail for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (expose corruption) tightens causally but pressure lacks meaningful opposition; protagonist's agency drives escalation yet discoveries feel unearned (compartment yields too easily).

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (Elias’s credibility, Thomas’s freedom) tighten via Alistair’s dialogue ("sometimes the most broken things reveal the most truth"), but the cost of Elias’s action isn’t viscerally shown—only resolved through internal shift, missing tangible consequence on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation thrives under Accumulative pressure: the kaleidoscope’s transliteration deepens stakes from personal obsession to global awakening, with cost unmistakable in her physical toll and the sea’s stilled reaction, though agency lacks a meaningful mid-beat tradeoff beyond relentless work.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through number pattern escalation, but Mara's recording resolves via luck (bypassed security), not protagonist agency; cost (career risk) is legible but not dramatized in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes ("mend deepest fractures") escalate via mirror visions but remain conceptual; no tangible cost like lost time or injury alters tactics. Agency in reconstitution is clear, yet the dominant stake lacks visceral, scene-scale consequences to justify high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake ("sound of endings") deepens through survivor stories but lacks protagonist agency escalation. Man's question intensifies thematic pressure, yet Elara's passive listening forecloses no path with visible trade-off; cost remains internal without altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (mismatches as barrier to love) deepen through reflection, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven tightening—realization emerges passively without narrowing options or visible tactical cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake (preserving wisdom against change) signaled early. Agency clear in consecration, but cost remains abstract—no concrete tradeoff during ritual (e.g., physical strain, time pressure). Prophet's "imminent" arrival doesn't tighten tactics, weakening escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (transmuting pain) signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—agency remains observational. Conceptual cost ("process requiring patience") legible yet insufficiently visceral for high-band entry; no tactics altered by pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully as crystal drains during decoding, narrowing Elias's options to a single choice (accept depletion for the pattern), but the cost isn't viscerally felt until too late in the escalation arc.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten when fog lifts at pond, forcing crystallization. But "tidal longing" repetition dilutes escalation; cost (abandoned chalk) lacks visceral weight despite thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (taming time's chaos) tightens through Elara's agency: tremors → study → leaf insight → restructure. Cost is the observatory's irrevocable shift from "changeless stillness" to humming constancy. Escalation feels earned though the leaf epiphany resolves tension abruptly without sufficient prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (mending estrangement) tightens when Elara contacts Claire, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Claire's arrival ("within hours") feels coincidental rather than earned by Elara's pressure; no visible price alters tactics despite clear cost of time.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes signaled early via shadow mystery; one tightening (noon void activation) forecloses the core question with conceptual cost, but felt price lacks visceral weight beyond key's dormancy despite agency-driven escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (mending broken truths) signaled early, but escalation falters: maze tension dissipates upon garden entry, and "piece of certainty" demand lacks foreshadowing. Sacrifice deepens knowledge yet cost remains conceptual ("warmth"), not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation through polishing intensity reweights stake under accumulative lens; cost legible in transformed relationship to memories. Single deepening sufficient for length, but global cap applies.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (protected vulnerability) tighten meaningfully when Kai’s presence tests Elara’s refuge. Pressure coheres under accumulative lens: his notebook forces knowledge shift (she’s not alone), narrowing options to endurance or connection. Cost is felt in her hand brushing the pendant—a visible trade-off of safety for hope.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes ("weight of another's pain") deepen through cameo accumulation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—soldier/poet/child appear passively. Cost felt in transformation, but tactics don't alter until climax (shell glow response).

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (restoring practices) tightens via singing climax, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the vine/moon resolves conflict coincidentally. Moral calculus absent in peak choice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.8)
    No escalation of dominant stake—ritual proceeds unchallenged; "tremor" is coincidental complication without narrowing options or altering tactics under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes ("capture echoes for future wonder") signaled early with meaningful deepening, but pressure lacks tangible escalation—Elias never faces concrete failure risk. Agency clear yet cost remains abstract until final image under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten through emotional deepening as ash wood "whispers," narrowing options to endurance; felt cost in "grounding present" sip, but escalation lacks one visceral trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (negotiating eroded ambitions) tightens via camera wheel’s hum escalating to self-addressed plea. Agency-driven escalation culminates in stance crystallization with visible cost: regret transforms from "weight" to "spark of hope" without retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake ("resurrect purpose") lacks tangible escalation; no visible price paid for redirected flows. "Maze of intentions" remains thematic abstraction rather than pressure forcing stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (understanding lies) signaled early but pressure lacks agency-driven escalation; chest discovery feels unearned coincidence rather than tactical choice. Cost remains abstract ("changed everything") without visible price paid, failing band guardrail for 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.3)
    Stake (decoding knots) signaled early but pressure never tightens: fog thickens without raising stakes, no failed attempts or time pressure. Resolution occurs through epiphany alone; no visible price paid for knowledge. Escalation flat under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten when the woman admits waiting for a ship that won’t return, crystallizing the "explained absences" conflict; but the ship’s timing lacks causal pressure on choices, missing the visible cost escalation needed for 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten causally through assembling machine fragments, narrowing options to accepting flawed genesis. Conceptual cost ("progress over preservation") legible in final reckoning, though mechanical world's threat remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (proving scars sing) remains abstract, never viscerally tested. Ritual planting lacks escalation—no narrowing of options or trade-offs. Cloud migration hints at time pressure but doesn't alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through Elara's agency—each breadcrumb deepens knowledge and narrows options under causal lens. Cost is legible in the reflection moment, though "testing her" abstraction slightly weakens pressure in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (sharing light without fire) tightens via gear's conduit realization, but escalation lacks visible cost during light intensification; "weight of purpose" stated but not dramatized when stakes peak.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen organically from "impossible" stone-carving task to earned realization about grief’s nature; single tightening ("grief was a migration") reconfigures options with felt cost in her "lighter" but unresolved emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes tighten via Elias’s agency (carving, conversations), but lacks visible price paid—no trade-off like sacrificed winding time. Pressure accumulates cleanly under Accumulative lens, yet secondary stake (town fractures) feels underserved by single scene scope.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    Dominant stake (decoding intentions) lacks escalation; pressure never tightens beyond Elias’s focus. Tapestry’s "love, loss, redemption" remains abstract—no trade-off (e.g., physical strain or doubt) narrows options. Coincidence (finding case) complicates but agency never drives deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (inspiring stagnant people) remains off-page; no concrete on-page resistance or cost. Doubters mentioned but never pressure protagonist, making escalation feel unearned despite atmospheric tension.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (resurrecting stories) tightens via broadcast’s arrival, narrowing options from transcription to lyric capture; cost legible in abandoned quill, but "story famine" remains abstract—no concrete loss (e.g., ink depletion, time pressure) alters tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes deepen through ash scattering's physical act, but the rocking chair's cessation lacks causal pressure—it merely witnesses rather than tightening options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (past preservation vs. future progress) signaled early, but escalation falters—the clash with Lira resolves off-page without visible cost. Collapse creates urgency, yet no tangible price (e.g., sacrificing artifacts) charges the final image. Band guardrail fails: tightening forecloses no live option; cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully through "subtracting noise" method, but escalation isn't clearly driven by Elara's agency—the choir's growth feels convenient rather than earned under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s pruning—a meaningful deepening—but celestial alignment’s "once-in-a-lifetime" pressure remains abstract; cost is felt (doubt) but not viscerally paid until the fruit’s bite.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. ignorance) tightens via descent into chamber, but pressure lacks visceral opposition; conceptual cost clear though physical/emotional stakes remain abstract, missing a felt price that reshapes tactics beyond the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Elias's agency: collecting objects transforms abstract curiosity into tangible ritual with felt cost (embracing perpetual displacement). Pressure tightens via Accumulative lens as object pile grows, narrowing his path to sanctification. Final image crystallizes the price—"whispering stories he was now ready to hear" forecloses normal silence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully around ampoule fragility with visible cost (Elara's fractured resolve), but secondary pressure from village disease feels off-page, diluting dominant stake escalation under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen organically from capturing memory to embracing impermanence; the die slip forces agency via the solitary roll of "three," narrowing options while the staircase's shifting walls intensify pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (rousing lost language) tightens via moon's ascent and brush's intensifying warmth; Elara's shift from personal solace to communal purpose creates authentic tension between insomnia-driven ritual and sudden urgency, with exhaustion-to-purpose transformation as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (cultural erasure) tighten through the lens’s uncanny effects (shadows, whispers), forcing Elara to act—but escalation lacks agency-driven narrowing. The honey’s introduction feels coincidental rather than a choice with cost; the beekeeper’s absence removes temporal pressure. Resolution succeeds via communal reconnection, yet the pivotal bread-sharing lacks a live option foreclosure (e.g., dissenting elders).

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes (confronting fear's weakness) tighten meaningfully when mirrors shift reality, but "time bends to your will" undermines agency. Cost is legible in the funhouse's dissolution, though fear's acknowledgment feels intellectually neat rather than viscerally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes (resolving dissonance) tighten through Leeward’s agency: each note narrows options as clouds respond. Pressure escalates via Accumulative lens (density increase in cloud patterns), but cost is purely felt ("restlessness gone")—no visible price like injury or loss to charge the final image per 8.8+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes (city collapse) are clear but escalation lacks protagonist agency; the gate's opening via whistle-crack feels coincidental rather than earned through Elara's pattern mastery, weakening causal pressure under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes deepen when Elara sees "humanity behind lies," but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. The archive’s discovery relies on luck (loose floorboard), not earned tactics under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate through sensory density (silt depth, fading ink) narrowing options toward mosaic discovery; journal wrest tightens resolve, but "hushed blaze" repetition dilutes tension's causal progression under Accumulative lens despite sufficient deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake ("trace honest origins") signaled early, but blackout’s "waning" urgency remains abstract—no concrete moment where time pressure alters tactics. Stamp activation resolves conflict too cleanly; no trade-off or loss (e.g., stamina, tool, or moral compromise) to narrow options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten under Accumulative pressure when Lira’s "grief is not meant to be folded" shatters Kael’s craft-based coping. Agency in walking to the basilica forecloses escapism, with cost legible in his trembling hands and emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (decoding belonging) tightens via artifact assembly, but pressure lacks escalation—no narrowing of options or felt trade-offs during searches. Cost remains conceptual rather than visible; "weight both familiar and alien" hints at internal cost but avoids dramatized forfeiture or tactical alteration.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single deepening—memory surfacing via clock carving—narrows options to renunciation; "sieved hush" reweights guilt as felt cost, though time pressure remains underutilized as a live constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: "untether" evolves from metaphor to physical action (drawer pull exchange). Cost legible in Kael's "I do not forgive lightly" concession. Escalation driven by Elara's agency but moon phase method lacks causal pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative escalation deepens internal stakes through sensory accumulation (compass→poles→water), narrowing options to adaptation. Cost is unmistakable in "learning to move with it" with visible pressure from regret’s weight to measured hope.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (erasing past vs understanding it) tightens as Elias moves from observer to participant; cost is irreversible identity shift. Agency-driven escalation lacks visceral friction—empathy’s "weight" remains slightly abstract despite physical immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen when the guardian reframes the bond as self-connection, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure. The scent-guided conjuring resolves conflict too easily without meaningful tactical cost or prior struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (reconciling with lost time) tightens through card draws that narrow options from seeking to acceptance. Agency shines in pressing her palm against the saucer, triggering the vision. Cost is visceral ("stone in her chest"), but the resolution leans slightly tidy for high-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten credibly through Elara’s agency (sundial decryption to key activation), though the abstract "oppressed populace" weakens visceral cost legibility despite Thorne’s hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten credibly when sequence unlocks patterns, narrowing Kael's options to scattering star dust. Conceptual cost (enduring mystery) is legible but diluted by "friction disappeared" abstraction; escalation driven by his agency under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: his "test your theory" reversal forces Mara's hesitation, narrowing options to conceptual surrender. The cost—relinquishing destination-seeking—is legible in the brook's transformed murmur becoming "music" during the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative/Textural lens as memories accumulate, but escalation lacks protagonist-driven pressure—the reel’s magic resolves grief rather than Elara’s agency narrowing options under coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (memory preservation) is signaled early, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—monsoon arrives as passive backdrop, not live clock altering Elara’s tactics. Pressure remains static after creature encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single tightening via compass needle settling narrows options from passive searching to active cove journey. Stakes escalate through Accumulative lens: letters’ dissolution embodies “cost of release” with visceral consequence. Moral calculus sharpens peak choice—speaking raw apologies lets ocean absorb sorrow—but secondary stake (“color” as object) resolves too neatly.
