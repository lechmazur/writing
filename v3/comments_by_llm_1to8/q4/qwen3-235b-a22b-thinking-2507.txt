  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Pressure accumulates through textural deepening: from career frustration to seeking refuge to discovering meaning in dust patterns. The dominant stake (finding authentic scientific practice versus demanded spectacle) tightens when she realizes the dust mirrors neutron star physics. Cost visible in abandoning "grant committees and press releases."

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from survival to understanding why she was targeted, then deepen when she discovers her art's corruption. The frost patterns melting creates natural time pressure. Deduction for relatively low immediate physical danger after the opening and some convenience in finding the glass vial exactly where needed.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief to artistic breakthrough as Elara's frustration with chaotic data transforms into discovery. The resonator's introduction creates meaningful deepening—not just solving but reframing the problem entirely. Cost is visible: three years of failed attempts before accepting silence's permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal exhaustion to cosmic responsibility for the restless dead. The transformation of the lens from distress signal to calming beacon represents meaningful deepening under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible: Silas sacrifices his own rest to provide it for others. Minor issue with the spectral inhabitants feeling somewhat abstract until resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear (survival under sanctions) with meaningful escalation through the youth joining the run and risk of drone detection. The final bell-ringing crystallizes the choice between silence and declaration. Deduction for cost remaining somewhat abstract rather than showing specific prices paid for this defiance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—escalates through Elara's breathing technique shifting perception within the camera obscura, revealing "shimmering threads of gold." The cost is legible as she releases "fear and guilt from her past life," though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly without significant resistance or complication.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from trapped observation to active crawling through earth to grasping the fragment, with each action narrowing options. The cost manifests in dissolving photographs and lost years, though the garden's collapse could generate more immediate physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from decoding the vault to racing against the building's collapse, with the dominant stake (preserving seeds for land restoration) maintained throughout. The tightening occurs when "minutes, perhaps seconds" remain, forcing immediate action. Cost is visible in her physical sacrifice, though the arrival of rain slightly undercuts the earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure—each failed attempt adds urgency ("cells divided unseen... urgency intensify"), culminating in the crystalline ping discovery. The stakes remain primarily internal; external pressure could strengthen the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—decoding the portrait's message to find answers about her mother—escalates through the revelation of Platform Zero coordinates. The shift from external quest to internal discovery provides meaningful deepening. However, the lack of active opposition or time pressure beyond the sunset timing limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.6)
    The dominant stake—creating glass orbs as "safe zones for inquiry"—remains static until water forces abandonment. The flooding provides external pressure but Elias simply relocates his completed work without meaningful trade-off. His internal thawing parallels the ice melting but lacks dramatized resistance or cost beyond leaving equipment behind.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear dominant stake of exposing betrayal versus remaining silent, with escalation through the decryption discovery that transforms vulnerability into agency. The cost is legible in Maya's trembling confrontation of aquaphobia. The resolution feels slightly convenient with the quick pivot from discovery to broadcast without exploring intermediate obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—completing the map before endless night arrives—escalates through the storm's rhythm providing the very silences she must document. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each marked silence ("a wide, curving bay of quiet") builds toward the final revelation. The cost is legible when "the single star winked out" and "darkness, absolute and immense, flooded the ridge fort," yet she finds navigation possible.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=5.6)
    Stakes are declared ("sentience remained an imitation") but lack visceral pressure. The story tells us about previous loops' failures without showing current struggle. No meaningful escalation occurs—Unit 7 simply plays the violin and achieves understanding without obstacle or meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about abandoned tickets through discovery of documented tension to the choice between maintaining professional distance or intervening. The final cost—Elara sacrificing her comfortable invisibility—is proportionate to the story's scale, though the musicians' conflict resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on proving "gardens knew their gardeners" against Quantifier metrics. Escalation builds through accumulation: forget-me-nots bloom despite "12% Luck," then lean toward her, ivy shows "emerald growth," culminating in the rose's "perfect" unfurling. Cost is legible in the "8%" reading persisting while the garden responds, showing the price of working outside the system.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving lateral time theory—is clear from the start. Tension builds through the lever pull sequence with genuine risk (triggering alarms). However, the resolution lacks meaningful opposition; the experiment simply works without complication or trade-off, reducing dramatic pressure at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about legend to deciphering ephemeral water-damage code to uncovering proof of innocence. The ticking pressure of the program "disintegrating entirely" forces immediate action. Cost is visible in Elias's acceptance of carrying this burden forward, though the final transformation could show more visceral price.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through density increase as Elara moves from fever recovery to actively weighing the illustration, with the accidental smudge creating the decisive deepening. The cost—accepting permanent distortion in memory—is clear but the single-beat structure limits escalation potential.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—confronting truth versus maintaining skepticism—escalates through the valve wheel's increasing weight and the radio confession creating external pressure. The ghost shift's arrival forces Leo's stance crystallization, though the resolution relies somewhat on atmospheric accumulation rather than sharp causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    The tremor creates genuine pressure that escalates from panic to acceptance, with Elara's choice to witness rather than intervene carrying the clear cost of losing the Sky Gardens texts. The internal conflict between her instinct to save and her vow to witness without judgment drives the central tension effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake - nurturing wonder against modern anxiety - is signaled early and tested through Leo's fear. The eclipse provides natural escalation, and Leo's transformation represents a meaningful deepening. However, the resolution lacks sufficient resistance; Leo's shift happens too readily without intermediate struggle that would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on preserving humanity's final testimonies before Elara's systems fail. The pressure deepens through Clara's diary revelations about the displaced axis catastrophe, building to Elara's commitment to synthesize "the earth's own testimony" with human witness. While external conflict is minimal, the internal pressure of being "the last archivist" facing inevitable system failure creates genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: isolation/yearning → mysterious microdot → freighter in mortal danger → successful intervention. The "sea singing backwards" as timing mechanism creates genuine pressure. Cost is visible in Elara's exhaustion and the near-disaster. Minor deduction because the resolution relies somewhat on convenient timing of storm and ship arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: questions layer, cracks widen, bells toll toward thirteen. The dominant stake (preventing dimensional collapse) tightens effectively through the rhetorical probe that forces collective recognition, with clear cost in the "scarred" stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through memory-mapping progression from single notes (cello) to full orchestra, with exhaustion as the ticking clock creating urgency. The cost is visible in her physical collapse. One meaningful deepening occurs as memories accumulate into symphony, though the conflict could use more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation operates through accumulative pressure as each encountered self-version demands increasingly difficult renunciation—from walking through the fearful boy to rejecting the hollow older self. The "darkening brightness" intensifies appropriately with the narrowing path. The cost becomes legible when Kael must destroy the tablet that guided him, accepting singular responsibility for future choices.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation builds from numbness through discovery to shared connection, with the broken needle forcing innovative engagement. The dominant stake (defeating numbness) tightens when reversed playback creates "unfamiliar, intricate pulses," though Silas's arrival doesn't add pressure, only validation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal unease to zone-wide threat as Elara decodes the message and recognizes the breach's implications. Her agency drives the progression - examining the tube, identifying the indigo dye, crafting the coded response. The dominant stake (maintaining the quarantine's integrity) tightens when she realizes official channels are compromised, forcing her to act through subterfuge with clear risk to her position.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation works through accumulative density - from setting lanterns to approaching the Bloom to the revelation sequence. The stakes deepen from understanding tears to confronting "irreplaceable wholeness" of lost moments. Cost is legible in the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the rope's revelations—from examining knots to discovering the escapee's choice to recognizing the slipknot's mercy—building toward Elara's impossible choice between preservation and voice. The third-path solution demonstrates agency, though the energy beings' actual threat remains somewhat abstract, limiting peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation reads as density increase from chronic hush to micro-sounds to violin fragments to transformed silence. The bowl's new vibration creates the tightening that forces the unbinding choice. Cost is visible in "months she hadn't unbound it, fearing the sound would shatter the fragile peace."

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation through accumulative pressure as static intensifies, vapor lingers unexpectedly, and the "emergent property" forces Lena to confront the gap between counterfeit and genuine emotion. The cost is visible in her abandoning the perfection of her craft for ethical space. One meaningful deepening that changes knowledge under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from mistaken address to confronting systemic erasure of workers. The revelation about Mateo's medicine rerouting deepens conflict and forces Aris to reckon with his complicity. Cost is visible in Elena's grief and Aris's recognition of exploitation. Minor deduction for union objection being too quickly overcome.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need for belonging—escalates through each tag discovery, tightening from solitary searching to collective gathering at the arbor. The revelation that there is no single Weaver forces a meaningful reconfiguration, though the conflict could push harder against Elara's initial assumptions.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate from searching for echoes to recognizing the closing window within the giant's breath cycle. The interrupted cadence creates mounting pressure that Elara must deliberately worsen before resolution. Her decisive knife strike against obsidian transforms passive observation into active disruption with clear risk. Cost manifests through exhaustion and the irrevocable change to her artistic vision.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why the orchard fell silent—deepens through the glass eyes revealing emotional spectra, then tightens when the mosaic patterns provide the mathematical key. Cost is visible in accepting ambiguous loss as interval rather than ending. The escalation from seeking understanding to achieving partial resolution with acknowledged incompleteness works under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal need (visibility) through discovery to moral choice (helping Mrs. Gable), with clear cost when Elara surrenders the tape. The dominant stake is well-signaled and tightens through the decision to give rather than keep. Pressure builds appropriately under the textural lens, though the conflict lacks active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation follows the accumulative pattern perfectly: 27 days of resistance, the anomalous leaf discovery, the dream catalyst, then active surrender through soil loosening. The dominant stake (understanding versus control) tightens when she releases her "compacted earth" both literally and metaphorically. Cost is visible in her abandoning her "meticulous reconstruction of ideal conditions."

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: physical discovery (brooch) → historical context (enemy faction) → personal reckoning (shared humanity with Kael) → transformation (new artistic purpose). The dominant stake of finding meaning from trauma tightens as each revelation forces Elara to confront war's complexity, though the final cost remains more conceptual than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate from Elara's failed vision through discovering her blindness to finally accepting a new path. The pilgrim's arrival with the pearl creates immediate pressure that forces stance crystallization. Cost is visible in Elara's relinquishing her previous identity, though the resolution feels slightly smooth given the magnitude of change.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from cataloguing fragments to actively healing the city's despair through "staggered intervals" that build hope. The trumpet's restoration creates meaningful pressure that forces Elara's choice between passive documentation and active intervention, with the unpredictable timing preventing scheduled hope.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from mapping exercise to personal reckoning through clear pressure points: following cracks, entering booth, descending stairs, confronting mother's vial. The cost manifests in forced confession "I stopped visiting her," though middle section could tighten between stations.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief/skepticism to whale survival, with Elara's reputation as the price. The vision sequence tightens pressure by revealing the shipping lane danger, forcing her choice between safety and action. Cost is visible when she spreads her transcriptions knowing "sharing it would brand her as a fool."

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation builds through spatial mutiny intensifying from tremors to full vortex, forcing Aeon's sacrifice. The dominant stake (discovering what lies beyond goodbye) tightens as the fragment's hunger threatens total dissolution. Cost is legible in losing his "only tether to meaning."

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake (father's deportation) is clear from the start, but escalation is minimal - Elara prepares, Reynolds arrives, she presents, he accepts. The conflict lacks meaningful resistance or complication. The "fair trade" resolution arrives too easily without sufficient opposition or cost demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation reads as density increase from silence to vibration to temporal breakthrough, fitting the accumulative lens. The hum's faltering creates reversal that tests commitment. Cost visible in tears and the town's continued silence, though the personal stake could sharpen further against the apocalyptic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through fragment accumulation: poison label → guard's comment → customs officers → fisherman → sister's testimony, each tightening the murder cover-up narrative. The tide's rhythm creates genuine pressure forcing tactical retreats. Cost is visible in Elias's permanent erasure, though the personal stakes could intensify more dramatically in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake - decoding Elara's riddle about silence - progresses through meaningful deepening as Aris moves from seeking to understanding. The shell's transformation from "cool" to "warmer, humming" marks escalation. Cost becomes visible when he abandons his skepticism for "unprovable" truth. The resolution depends on protagonist agency (playing the cello) not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate clearly from observing graffiti to understanding imminent threat to proposing active resistance. The pressure tightens effectively when Elara reveals the contract, forcing Kael from observer to leader. Some cost could be more visceral—the acceptance of partial defeat lands intellectually but not quite emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving the crater's image before destruction) is clear from the opening and tightens through the chemical timer's precision requirement. The dawn deadline creates genuine pressure, though escalation remains steady rather than intensifying. Cost is visible in Aris's emotional state and the irreversibility of tomorrow's bulldozers.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from technical repair to emotional gift-giving, with the Horizon's Call departure creating natural time pressure. The "discordant whisper" smoothing to "steady thrum" tracks clear progression. Cost becomes tangible in the final separation, though middle-section pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (finding where rivers begin) is clear, with pressure building through the convergence of evidence and time constraints ("Time was thinning"). However, escalation relies on intellectual assembly rather than active conflict. The worry about freezing if wrong provides stakes but never manifests as immediate threat.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes crystallize through the progression from solo listening to collective walking, with escalation in the residents' gradual synchronization. The dominant stake—restoring harmonic balance—faces concrete test when skeptical Tomas's heavy boots must find the rhythm. Cost appears in the "shower of dust" and stones settling, though the transformation could carry more visceral weight.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from oxygen depletion through signal repair to rescue arrival. The trade-off between fleeing upward and staying to fix the beacon creates genuine tension. Cost is visible in physical deterioration and the relinquished vial, though the mystical solution slightly diminishes earned agency.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (escape before discovery) creates urgency with the ticking clock of approaching guards. Escalation occurs through the physical descent and metaphorical journey toward silence. However, the hovering resolution feels unearned and reduces tension, though the final cost of vanishing into the sea lands with appropriate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from individual plants to the orchard's eternal magic: "If they died, the orchard's magic would fade forever." The ghost's essence fraying with each use creates accumulating cost. The final resonance that saves everything while destroying her demonstrates clear trade-off. Pressure coheres through the pattern of diminishing returns—each healing costs more of her form.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal solace-seeking to community renewal through the silk-weaving action. The tension between fragility ("vulnerable to wind and rain") and persistence creates genuine pressure. Cost is visible in bleeding fingers and the emotional release of the villagers, though the conflict could tighten further in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from personal restoration desire to communal faith renewal, tightening when the sundial discovery reveals what was lost "when the old ways faded." The cost lands in Kael's tears and the acknowledged generational break. Escalation reads more as accumulative deepening than causal tightening, appropriate to the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preserving anonymity to discovering the client's true intention through active investigation—decoding chalk, following coordinates, uncovering genealogical truth. The revelation forces Silas to reconceptualize his role from fabricator to truth-guardian. Cost appears in emotional response and the weight of responsibility, though the personal price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the seven-minute countdown with guard proximity creating immediate danger, forcing Elara to maintain her disguise while executing precise timing. The transmission succeeds but lacks a visible price beyond risk—no actual loss or sacrifice occurs on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulating condensation messages that deepen understanding: from fragments to the crucial "Hand on the gate" moment. The dominant stake—finding the moment before decision—tightens as each revelation costs Elara physically (bleeding) and emotionally ("feel the sister's regret as her own"). The moonlight's timing creates genuine pressure that forces acceptance rather than pursuit.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered recognitions - from decoding the cast to understanding shared trauma to the final gift. The stake of "translating pain into understanding" deepens appropriately. Cost is legible in both characters' transformations, though the resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—rediscovering joy before spiritual death—is clear, with meaningful deepening when Elara realizes joy is "the act of reaching through the mist." The story's single tightening occurs when she discovers the fresco fragment and remembers her light-painting ability, narrowing her options from wandering despair to purposeful action. However, the conflict lacks external pressure or meaningful opposition; the resolution feels too smooth without sufficient cost or trade-off to enter the 7.0+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (certainty vs curiosity) escalates through the nested awakenings, each layer deepening Elara's engagement. The cost is clear - she loses her professional certainty but gains wonder. However, the visitor's presence feels more functional than pressurized.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from message-planting urgency to city-wide thought control threat, with the dawn deadline creating time pressure. The protagonist's agency drives the solution through discovering and implementing the counter-frequency. Cost manifests in the risk Aris takes planting under drone surveillance, though the resolution's ease (immediate disruption success) slightly undermines tension.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake—achieving peace through artistic transformation—escalates through accumulating imagery and the poet's "shyly unstoppable" persistence against centuries of insomnia. The "first blossom of truce blooming in his palm" marks a meaningful deepening that reweights his struggle, though the conflict lacks external pressure or concrete opposition beyond time itself.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from one cracked chime to "dozens of names still teetered on oblivion," with each preservation requiring deeper effort (humming, then singing fragments, then the full song). The protagonist's agency drives all three preservation acts with visible cost in exhaustion. Deduction for relatively predictable progression without significant reversal or complication that would heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as each translation vow builds toward the Veridian Knot's unraveling, with visible cost in risking the fragile ink well. The dawn deadline creates urgency that tightens choices. Minor deduction: the resolution feels slightly convenient as each language connection works perfectly without setback.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (preventing reservoir breach while preserving the ruins) escalates through Aris's discovery of the hidden channel, forcing a choice between following orders and trusting Elara's radical solution. The cost is legible in Aris choosing to "speak for Elara's silent compassion" over "modern, rigid protocols," though the external pressure of the imminent monsoon could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (preserving vs. destroying history) escalates through the critical transport task requiring trust in Hermes. The tightening occurs when she must choose between perfect control and releasing the chip to uncertain flight. Cost is visible in the risk to "irreplaceable history, another betrayal echoing her past forgeries."

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are immediately clear: cross thresholds wrong and "everything shatters." The escalation from studying the logbook to intuiting the WX-9 frequency through wood grain creates meaningful tightening. The cost is visible—maintaining separation from her father—and the final choice between rushing forward or honoring distance carries genuine weight, though the middle section could use more immediate physical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating pressure: agitated plankton → feather discovery → desperate light calibration → time pressure until sunrise. The dominant stake of belonging tightens when Kael appears, forcing connection. Cost manifests in the facility's dwindling reserves and Elara's weeks of isolation, though agency could strengthen in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes are clear—recovering the sky-whales' path before memory fades—but escalation is minimal under an Accumulative lens. The discovery unfolds through steady accumulation of seed-readings rather than meaningful tightening, and the time pressure ("mere hours") never manifests as altered tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—transforming monotony through orchestrated serendipity—is clear early. The tide's arrival creates textural escalation as instruments join the symphony. However, the pressure remains largely external (tide mechanics) without forcing difficult choices or visible trade-offs from Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the ritual's progression from observation of gaps to physical inscription to spontaneous anchoring, with clear cost in the moonstone's consumption and Elara's transformation. The dominant stake—creating art that transcends censorship—tightens as her body locks but mind soars. Missing higher band because the opposition remains abstract (the ban) rather than creating immediate scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake of finding authentic value escalates through the stone-throwing ritual as ripples reveal deeper patterns of interconnection, narrowing from abstract seeking to concrete understanding. Cost manifests in returning to "hollow" commissions with transformed perspective, though the conflict remains primarily internal without external pressure testing the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (transforming personal guilt into communal warning) deepens through reflection rather than external conflict. Cost is visible in Elara's lost innocence and Kai's ongoing "ember in his chest." The internal pressure tightens as he moves from isolation to shared purpose, though the transformation could use more concrete resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation as balloon failures erode Elara's spirit while her core motivation holds "firm like the grotto's unyielding walls." The tightening occurs when Timeline D reveals itself only after multiple failures, forcing recognition that hope requires "shared vulnerability." The cost is visible: she must abandon her "solitary genius" approach, with the gauge's consistent "100 feet" confirming the paradigm shift.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake (discovering what walls dream about) evolves through textural accumulation as Elias uncovers Thorne's materials, culminating in his resolve to carry forward the testimony. The deepening from acoustic mapping to moral witness shows clear progression. Cost appears in Thorne's shame and the "legacy's burden," though protagonist agency remains mostly observational rather than facing active opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from the first mirror's warm vision to the resistant central mirror requiring deeper stillness and collective yearning. The bells create genuine time pressure. Cost manifests in the widower's tears and the painter's necessary disappearance. The borrowed heartbeat mechanism creates reciprocal vulnerability.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (preventing violence through admission of fault) escalates from accusation through Elara's vulnerable admission to Kael's conditional engagement. The "operatively gentle" approach creates coherent pressure under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible ("political suicide"), though the single-beat escalation limits the upper range.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure: from crossing the flat to kneeling at the precise confluence to placing the egg, each beat deepens the weight of Thorne's contradiction. The cost is legible in his "broken by the weight of a single, hollow egg," though agency remains somewhat passive.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each untangled thread releases echoes that fray the lullaby's drone, culminating in the "full harvest" that shatters control. The central knot from the founding queen provides meaningful deepening. Cost is legible—Elara sacrifices her protected station, and the lullaby's resistance "threatening to strangle" creates genuine stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The conflict between Elias and Mara over ethical storytelling escalates through specific examples (puppet show with refugees/guards) to Elias's realization. Cost is visible in accepting the "fragile, luminous ink of understanding" rather than certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch's migration—escalates through the wind's disruption, forcing a shift from controlled ritual to witnessed accident. The cost manifests in Elara's loss of control over her signal, transformed into something greater than intended when the butterfly carries the wing "far beyond the grotto."

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: from handling the fragile card to reconfiguring the rope to the aurora's violent flare, each step risks losing the names forever. The cost is visible in Elara's tears and the sacrificial burning of wax. Slight deduction because the rope's magical properties arrive without earlier grounding, but the emotional stakes and technical precision create genuine tension.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate through the storm's approach, bunker's imminent flooding, and wafer seal's fragility creating irreversible choice. The 7:39 deadline and lightning countdown add temporal pressure. However, the resolution through "placing palms on the arch" feels slightly convenient despite the accumulative buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—sealing the covenant before erasure—is signaled early and tightens through the tile's transformation sequence. Escalation occurs through the alignment process, the moment of apparent failure ("Nothing happened"), then the tile's activation. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost; while conceptually meaningful, Kael faces no hard trade-off or sacrifice beyond what he'd already accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: single note → cellular memory flood → multiple notes → full surrender. The dominant stake (teaching Kael to release resentment before reality consumes them) faces genuine pressure as reality fractures. Cost is visible in Kael's tears and shuddering release, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with the perfectly-timed grace alignment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: isolation → frustration → desperation → seeking help → synchronized breathing → revelation. The cost manifests in Elara abandoning her solitary, technical approach for vulnerable connection with Silas, though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly once breathing synchronizes.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom before it's lost—faces escalating pressure through material shortage forcing the ribbon choice. The conflict deepens from external (contract breach, missing supplies) to internal (rigid thinking about permanence). However, Liora's arrival resolves tension too conveniently without sufficient prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from observation mission to understanding time's structure to participating in the temporal loop. The dominant stake (pursuing forbidden knowledge) tightens when Aris must choose between Archive directives and understanding. The cost becomes legible when he sees himself completing the loop, though the middle section could apply more pressure before the breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Temporal pressure escalates from "minutes, not hours" through the mountain's demand for higher payment to successful rescue. Elara's agency drives the resolution through researching gaps, sacrificing knowledge, and enabling Kael's passage. The cost manifests concretely in blood-ink and surrendered truth, though Kael's rescue happens off-page without visible struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (finding Elara through the garden of forgotten names) establishes early and tightens when Lyra must "kindle her own" solace to proceed. The ship's "unkindled solace made manifest" creates a barrier requiring internal transformation. However, the resolution lacks visceral cost—Lyra's acceptance feels conceptual rather than dramatically earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes build through accumulative pressure as Elara unpicks and reweaves the rope, each strand representing "a decade of silence." The cost manifests in the revelation's emotional weight. Minor deduction because the physical weaving lacks immediate resistance or risk beyond patience.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from sanctuary disruption to the discovery of the acoustic focal point, with Elara's agency driving the resolution through knowledge and deliberate action. The tightening occurs as she moves from overwhelmed ("stone flickered weakly") to empowered conjurer. Cost is visible in her physical exhaustion and the caves' permanent transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal conviction to cosmic validation as Vega's alignment creates the one-chance moment. The "if she failed, the silence would swallow everything" establishes clear cost. Pressure tightens through astronomical precision requiring exact timing and angle. The bird's return as "answer" from the universe provides meaningful deepening, though agency slightly softens when success seems universe-granted rather than purely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake - preserving collective memory while confronting personal transience - maintains coherent pressure throughout. The story achieves one meaningful deepening as Elara realizes "by curating their past, she was actively sculpting her identity." However, escalation remains contemplative rather than forcing trade-offs or foreclosing options, limiting higher band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on Elara's need to "defy that suffocating void" after her fireworks tragedy. The mosaic discovery provides the turning point, shifting from passive wandering to active creation. Cost is visible in her careful, controlled flame—acknowledging danger while reclaiming agency.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (understanding time to resolve the teaching conflict) deepens through the water droplet meditation, which reweights the conflict from opposition to natural cycle. Cost is legible in accepting "necessary friction that polished understanding smooth." One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from collecting to failing capture to surrender/transformation, with the gilded hush's resistance forcing Elara to abandon control. The cost registers when she must return below carrying only potential rather than possession, though middle pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from monitoring brittle silence to actively transforming it through calibrated humming, with the prisms' vulnerability providing constant pressure. The 32-35 decibel sweet spot creates concrete constraint, and Silas's agency drives the transformation. Cost appears in the collective trauma being processed and the risk of shattering, though the resolution feels slightly frictionless.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: waterfall entry → paint revelation → ruby flake's prismatic discovery → stairway descent → throne transformation. The sunrise deadline creates genuine pressure. Cost is visible when Elara accepts witness role over rulership, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.9)
    The child spirit's suffocating despair creates escalating pressure that Elara must counter through her own scarred memory of drowning. The threshold's thinning after resolution shows clear cost—each success weakens her barrier. Stakes deepen from maintaining boundaries to teaching release at personal expense, with the final image of joining "the starlight above" foreclosing her path.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on protecting the farm from exploitation, signaled early through Elara's survivor status and the warning texts. Escalation follows the causal chain from setup → warnings → Silas's arrival → confrontation. The lever action forecloses Silas's scheme with visible cost in the destroyed device, though the resolution feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as vibrations intensify and patterns coalesce into readable messages. The dominant stake (uncovering truth about Silas) tightens effectively. However, the resolution arrives without sufficient resistance - the truth unfolds too smoothly once the mechanism activates.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation from discovery to recognition to action, with Torin's agency driving the resolution through deliberate pattern-tracing. The stakes of entropy versus possibility are well-established, though the abstract nature of "possibility" slightly dulls the visceral impact of what's at risk.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes deepen through discovery rather than external conflict - from processing files mechanically to understanding Marcus Chen's inheritance to recognizing her role in preserving "unclaimed legacies." The cost accumulates through layers: Daniel's absence, Thomas's sacrifice, Marcus aging out alone, culminating in Elara's commitment despite her own loss.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from the team's capture through Kael's desperate crawl to the approaching search drones, with clear cost in his shivering body and sacrificed key. The ticking clock of dawn killing the signal adds genuine pressure. The conflict could be stronger if we saw more immediate consequences of failure beyond abstract "erasure."

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are established immediately—the city will crumble if the harmonic resonance falls silent—with pressure building through the birds' coded sequence reaching "peak resonance." The resolution through strategic silence ("using the silences between his notes as the true weapon") shows agency and innovation, though the conflict lacks a meaningful reversal or deepening complication.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal ritual to world-transformation as Elara decodes the leaf's message and abandons her sorting to build monuments. The Hush creates temporal pressure that forces action. Cost appears when she forsakes her ordered chest for uncertain monument-building, though the transformation's ease slightly reduces tension.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake (befriending uncertainty) escalates through the improvised crossing where Aris must abandon his calibrated tools for intuition. The cost is visible when he leaves both compass and tools behind. However, the middle section could tighten—the journey to the conservatory lacks intermediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen from finding Elara to understanding how to honor her absence, with the failed first repair forcing recalibration. The cost manifests in accepting irrevocable loss rather than erasure, though pressure could tighten more sharply between attempts.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on releasing the spirit's torment through confronting shame. The escalation from jarring notes to spectral confession to transformed laughter provides clear progression under the accumulative lens. Cost is visible in both the mother's eternal self-damnation and Elara's "ache in her heart," though the resolution feels somewhat predetermined once the method begins.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation works through accumulative pressure as Kael progresses from passive suffering to active navigation of the UV field, discovering pain modulation through movement. The cost is legible in "agonizing, precise movement." However, the stakes could be clearer—survival is implied but not explicitly threatened, weakening urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through three painting discoveries, each revealing deeper connection to the keepers' histories. The pressure builds from coordinates to ship's logs to final transmissions, with personal cost crystallizing when Elara recognizes her great-uncle's script. The challenge structure provides clear escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity about ceiling secrets to releasing a trapped spirit, with the mainspring discovery narrowing options toward resolution. The dust patterns → drawer → key → compartment sequence creates coherent pressure under the accumulative lens, though the ghost's appearance could have introduced more complication before resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from preserving the library to confronting reality's inherent instability, with the bottled whisper forcing immediate action before "rupture imminent." The protagonist's agency drives the escalation through deliberate whisper-release, accepting the cost of destabilization to capture eternity. The rupture's revelation of multiple realities represents meaningful deepening rather than simple intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from ideological dispute to preventing renewed civil war, with the temporal storm creating immediate physical danger that forces action. Elara's agency drives the demonstration despite Varek's protests, and the cost lands viscerally—she proves her point but confronts that she "shattered the vase, and with it, the future." The tightening from argument to demonstration to bitter victory works well under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through the tethering sequence: sweat beads, lilies crumble to ash, the covenant tightens with metallic taste flooding his mouth. The risk of shattering the chip creates genuine jeopardy. Cost is visible in his trembling, rusted hands at closure, though middle pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative density: from measuring petrichor to psychometric reading to the lagoon's impossible physics demanding surrender. The cost is clear—abandoning scientific method and instruments. One meaningful deepening occurs when "Science ended here" forces Elara's fundamental choice.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—understanding her role in ocean-land alliances—deepens through the slide's visions, forcing Mara to reconceptualize her art from creation to reimagining. Cost is visible in her acceptance that she must honor the sea's rage alongside its bounty, though agency is somewhat passive during the vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding Leo's mystery/processing grief) deepens through failed attempts with firelight and steam before the cathedral solution works. The pressure accumulates but lacks a sharp reversal or heightened cost at the climax—the revelation comes somewhat easily once she finds the right method.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear escalation as retrocognitive visions intensify from fragments to full immersion, forcing Elias to act. The dominant stake (breaking free from temporal trap while uncovering truth) tightens effectively. Some convenience in how the debris arrangement immediately yields results, but cost is legible in the emotional and physical toll.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal loss through communal absence to the pressure of conceiving an entire civilization in working memory, with each detail threatening to "unravel" if forgotten. The cost is legible in his strained mental labor and rejection of the bottle's "false comfort," though the middle section could tighten the pressure more viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal curiosity to existential dread as the prophecy reveals the archive's true purpose as tomb rather than sanctuary. The apples' transformation and roots awakening create irreversible tightening. Cost is legible in Elias's final archived scream and the city's held breath.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the ritual's precise danger—"One wrong tremor, one gasp out of rhythm, and the vortex would collapse." The entropy reversal carries clear risk and requires Elara's fierce calm. However, the conflict remains primarily technical rather than forcing deeper personal trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (safety vs. protocol) established early and deepens through microclimate readings that contradict expectations. The pressure tightens at zero hour, forcing crystallization between mechanical obedience and intuitive wisdom. Cost is legible but somewhat understated - professional risk rather than immediate dramatic consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.6)
    The storm creates genuine pressure that forces Silas to choose between self-preservation and protecting the chronometers, with clear cost in physical vulnerability. His decision to use "stillness" rather than force represents earned agency, and the stakes escalate from personal grief to cosmic custodianship, though the conflict could push harder on the vulnerability/strength paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (preserving unspoken words) is signaled early and tightens when the ghost child appears, forcing Silas to interpret her message and renew his commitment. Cost is visible in continued silence and isolation. However, escalation is primarily accumulative rather than causal—the ghost's appearance deepens meaning but doesn't fundamentally narrow options since Silas was already committed.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes escalate through accumulating discoveries that narrow options: finding the fragment triggers the search, the gear reveals the silo's true nature as vault, forcing Elara to accept her role as message-keeper despite monitoring authorities. The texture metaphor—"not smooth flow, but fracture and mending"—deepens rather than reverses, though the authorities' threat remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.5)
    The kite incident provides the story's single meaningful turn, forcing Elara from passive observation to active engagement. The escalation from frustration to discovery follows the accumulative lens appropriately. However, the stakes remain gentle—the conflict lacks urgency that would elevate the discovery's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal (six months to live) through systematic intervention (wire-wrapping) to the revelation that "They listen"—confirming the symbiosis is reciprocal. The dominant stake of preserving interspecies respect before death tightens as villagers scoff, forcing Aris to make his work undeniable. Cost is visible in physical toll and the foreclosed option of easier final months.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through accumulation of chemical evidence toward the spectrometer's confirmation, appropriate for the textural lens. The dominant stake—proving the Aethel's message is scientific rather than spiritual—tightens as data converges. Cost appears in Elara's professional isolation, though personal risk could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of transforming battlefield to garden escalates through accumulating bird interactions, each species adding new knowledge and materials that deepen the healing process. Agency manifests through Elias's patient ritual work and linguistic exchanges that unlock ecological secrets. The cost is legible in the slow inch-by-inch reclamation and the weight of his fifty years ferrying death, though a sharper moment of personal sacrifice could strengthen the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from survival to hope when the cylinder's scent triggers recognition, then tighten when the phonograph produces only silence, forcing Silas to problem-solve. The discovery that the leaf acts as a decoder raises the cost—this isn't just a message but a deliberately hidden path requiring both objects. The final revelation transforms distance into a crossable space, with years of searching as the paid price.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    The dominant stake—Elara's need to preserve the family tradition before residual time dilation fades—creates urgency but lacks escalating pressure. The story maintains steady tension through atmospheric accumulation rather than building conflict, with no meaningful tightening or deepening that changes her options.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate through the sundial's backward shadow covering "half its face" as time thins, forcing Silas to move despite ice breaking beneath him. The chess piece swaps carry genuine risk—one misstep could "shatter a thousand-year glacier." Cost is visible when the ice shard falls into the abyss, though the resolution feels slightly convenient with all swaps completing smoothly after that single complication.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from Elara's mission to document gestures through the man's arrival forcing confrontation with suppressed trauma. The penumbra's movement creates temporal pressure, and her choice to unbind the journal carries clear cost in releasing guilt and truth. The progression from observing others to confronting her own buried gesture works well under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through textural accumulation - from searching to finding the stone to awakening it with the feather. The dominant stake (understanding home's shape) deepens when the stone reveals home as texture rather than location. Cost is clear in reopening painful memories, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily once the method is applied.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen as Elara winnows threads from ornamental damage to deliberate cipher to conspiracy proof, each discovery narrowing her emotional options. The thunder's progression from lull to crack to steady rain marks escalation, though middle sections could tighten for stronger pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear escalation from scattered poetry sessions to direct confrontation to transformative action, with stakes (ritual's success vs. artistic freedom) tightening when Vanya demands public retraction. The cost manifests in both Kael's risk and Vanya's emotional price, though the resolution arrives somewhat quickly for the established tension.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through the workshop's physical deterioration (support beam shearing, floor tilting, threshold breach) while Elara works against time. The dominant stake—completing the mending before dissolution—tightens effectively. Cost is visible in the acceptance of death, though the philosophical framing ("defiant narration of memory against the silence of dissolution") slightly abstracts the visceral moment.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (releasing grief through fulfilling the promise) escalates from restlessness through discovery to release, with clear cost in letting go. The tide's rhythm creating the "wrong turn" adds situational pressure. The resolution is earned through Elara's choice to place the shell, though the escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (saving the Marigold) escalates from visual sighting to the desperate release of scent, with clear cost in Eli's emotional investment. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens, though the ship's response feels slightly convenient despite the mystical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate clearly: ships heading toward reef → mysterious calls → building device → moon waning/time pressure → final ignition with tears. The dominant stake (preventing shipwrecks while processing grief) tightens through the waning moon's deadline. Cost is legible in Aris's physical suffering and emotional release. Minor deduction for the calls arriving too conveniently without earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal relief-seeking to the moral weight of truth-telling when Elara discovers the glass eye actually works. The cost is legible in her "sharp, clean pain" and Hemlock's emotional collapse. The tension between occluding empathy while amplifying truth creates genuine pressure that narrows her options to acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation of memory fragments that reweight Silas's understanding, forcing him from investigation to acceptance. The dominant stake (honoring the stranger's trust) tightens as memories intensify. Cost is visible in accepting permanent alteration of his solitary life. Slightly mechanical escalation in the middle third prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly through the rising water creating time pressure, forcing Elias to act. The dominant stake (finding meaning/escaping loneliness) tightens as options narrow. Cost is visible in the flooding chamber and the risk taken, though the emotional resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds from personal exhaustion through cosmic discovery to the moment where "bleeding starlight lapped at her boots," forcing confrontation. The stakes escalate from kingdom's evacuation to understanding the celestial hemorrhage threatens everything. Cost is visible but the resolution through pure will lacks the physical or sacrificial price that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    Kael's revelation ("I'm leaving... seasons, not years") provides the pressure that forces Elara's choice between capture and presence. The failed attempt to bottle his truth with the pocket-sun creates genuine stakes. Cost is visible in what she abandons (her alchemical mission) for what she gains (authentic connection).

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: finding the grave → retreating to cabin → confronting dreams → transforming jealousy into acceptance. The "feral nostalgia" intensifies from gentle ache to "wild, possessive hunger." Cost is legible in the transformation from unburdened past self to "jaded shell" to final integration, though the resolution could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation occurs through deepening recognition rather than external conflict - Elara's polishing gesture breaks the pattern and forces Chen's vulnerability. The stakes remain primarily internal but the cost becomes visible in Chen's final choice of bowl over screw.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—earning his master's sigil versus being branded a fraud—is signaled early and tightens as crystallization threatens to lock his joints. The escalation follows the textural lens as each rune dissolves more crystals, building toward complete transformation. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful reversal or complication; the solution arrives too smoothly once he begins writing.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal guilt to time pressure (chainsaws at dawn) to spiritual reconciliation. The induced current method creates genuine risk and the confrontation forces Elara to translate her apology into Silas's musical language. Cost is legible: reconciliation without resurrection, acceptance of the orchard's death, transformation of haunting into gentle presence.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on unifying universal law to expose cosmic deception, with pressure building through the spiral arbitration method. The dictionary definitions deepen understanding ("void" as "illusion of separation before unification") but the escalation lacks a concrete tightening moment or visible trade-off. The resolution arrives through placement of the dictionary without dramatized struggle or a foreclosed option with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The countdown creates escalating pressure through accumulative deepening—each numerical threshold brings sharper revelation about time's nature. The green flash at "three, two" provides external confirmation of internal discovery. Cost is legible in the "unbearable weight" and the shift from isolation to companionship with time's machinery.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes center on Elara choosing between security duty and revolutionary understanding, but the conflict resolves without visible cost—she keeps her job, gains knowledge, and redesigns security "to harmonize." The pressure doesn't meaningfully tighten as the strangers pose no real threat and Elara faces no consequence for abandoning her post.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes deepen through accumulation: father's condition, Elara's internal conflict about probability versus hope, culminating in her acceptance of necessary contradictions. The old woman encounter provides meaningful pressure. Cost is visible in Elara's transformation and the father's fragile state.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    Elena's return escalates from stranger-comfort to personal plea, forcing Silas to choose between his mission and human connection. The stakes tighten when she explicitly asks him to break his rules ("I need to find you"), and his refusal carries clear cost. The harmonica loop creates textural pressure that deepens the emotional weight of disconnection.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal preservation to communal transmission when the teenagers appear, with Elara's choice to share the locket photo and vellum foreclosing her private grief for public continuity. The dominant stake (preserving memory before demolition) tightens through time pressure and deepens when the girl's understanding creates "proximate cause of continuity."

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (cure for loneliness) deepens through the rumor chain investigation, with meaningful tightening when each lead dissolves. Cost is visible in Aris's shift from frantic searching to accepting present connection. Escalation could be stronger—the middle investigation feels slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.9)
    The constellation pause creates escalating time pressure ("Cassiopeia's throne began to tilt") that forces Elara to accelerate her search, with the dominant stake of finding peace with grief tested through physical and emotional obstacles. The cost lands when she must accept that healing requires active seeking rather than finding an external solution. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient discovery of the stone circle at the exact right moment.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes escalate through the pen's reactivation sequence and Elara's careful editing of spacetime, with tension in knowing "excess would shatter the delicate contingent relationships." However, the lack of active opposition or complication during the editing process limits dramatic pressure—the action succeeds without meaningful reversal or test.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from private practice to public disruption to musical translation, each narrowing Elara's options between invisibility and impact. The flute transformation deepens pressure—her mapped silences now demand performance. Cost is legible in the trade-off: beauty exists "only because she was unseen."

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—preserving forgotten knowledge—is signaled early and maintains coherence, but escalation remains largely intellectual (solving puzzles) rather than visceral. The story lacks a meaningful tightening that forecloses options; Elara progresses through discoveries without facing genuine opposition or having to sacrifice competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—breathing life into Lyra's stolen vision—is signaled early and tightens through escalating drumming that builds to the lagoon's manifestation. The reversal when "monitors began to shriek" and the vision dissolves represents meaningful deepening that forecloses Elara's path. Cost is legible in the transition from "frantic, joyful rhythm" to hands "going still on the cold metal."

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from discovery to infiltration with clear pressure points: the dawn deadline, Rourke's presence requiring improvisation, the quarantine zone's forbidden status. The dominant stake (proving whispers beat shouts) drives tactics consistently, though the threatened crane sabotage feels abstract rather than personally costly to Silas.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - teaching "darkness the value of stars" - escalates through the guardian's increasingly complex light patterns, from "a single, distant pinprick" to "perfect, radiant star." The child's shift from despair to wonder provides clear cost in the "half-spoken secret" now "fully known," though agency remains primarily with the guardian.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from internal perception of fears through planning to dawn's transformation. The magnetic field's role in synchronization provides concrete pressure mechanism. However, external opposition remains abstract (the "council") without embodied antagonistic force testing Elara's resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (belonging/identity) signaled early and tightens through accumulating pressure: whale's call, scrimshaw's warmth, island's emergence. The cost is unmistakable in "letting go of the life that had never fit" and the physical transformation that forecloses return. Agency manifests as decisive acceptance rather than resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving grief space under surveillance) escalates through Mrs. Gable's confrontation, forcing Elara to choose between safety and truth. The "darkness/potato" metaphor risks report but maintains her sanctuary. Cost is legible but the single confrontation limits pressure accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal artistic expression to rewriting societal laws, with Elara's shadow-poetry progressively dissolving more fundamental boundaries—first the physical colonnade barrier, then the ancient glyphs themselves. The cost registers in "the city's collective breath shift[ing]" and the permanent transformation of sacred space, though the opposition remains entirely passive.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The barter escalates from arrangement to negotiation to transformation, with Lysander sacrificing his "most precise tool." Cost is visible when he trades the reed that "helped him navigate his colorless world." The stakes deepen appropriately for this length, though middle pressure could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes intensify through Elara's discovery that sounds persist as "dormant vibrations in the grid's static," building to her risk of ringing the silent bell. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as density increases from theoretical questioning to physical manifestation (dust helix) to final action. Cost appears in "tears traced paths through the dust on her cheeks" and the foreclosure of pure restoration in favor of transformed understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes deepen from personal grief to community healing as Elara's actions escalate from private mourning jewelry to public light projections. The rain-lashed Tuesday doubt creates genuine pressure before the illumination choice. Cost is visible in her tears and the years of grief work she's abandoning for this new path.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (mapping cultural trauma post-crash) established early and deepens through Maya's arrival. Escalation occurs through accumulation—from private measurement to demonstrating "multiplying paths" that reveal different fractures. Cost visible in varying tensions (8.1 cm anger, 12.4 cm adaptation, 5.7 cm despair) though agency remains primarily observational rather than decisional.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through Elara's increasingly erratic movements and the pagoda's responsive light. The cost is legible in her deliberate scattering of beautiful memories. The single-beat structure limits deeper escalation possibilities.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from subtle erasures to consuming entire sequences to the revelation that hope itself feeds the darkness. The tightening works well under causal lens. Minor deduction as the physical/temporal pressure could be more immediate - the work feels methodical rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from discovering fraud to witnessing physical trauma to choosing patient reconstruction over immediate action. The chameleon's gradual trust-building provides meaningful deepening. Cost is visible in time spent and emotional toll of shattered convictions.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.0)
    The melting hourglass creates genuine temporal pressure that forces action (tunneling through ivy). Cost is legible in lost telepathy and physical struggle, though escalation occurs through accumulation rather than reversal, fitting the textural lens but lacking a sharp tightening moment.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.6)
    The dominant stake (finding where unused love is stored) is signaled immediately and the time pressure of demolition provides escalation. The discovery deepens from abstract vision to physical location to embodied transfer. However, the resolution lacks a meaningful trade-off or visible price beyond the building's destruction, which was predetermined.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as each traced star reveals another trapped vision—weaver's hands, potter's wheel—deepening the stakes. The "auroras flared violently" marks intensification, and Elara's final gesture "pouring every ounce of her moonstruck longing" shows agency driving the climax. Cost is legible in her physical collapse and the valley's "shared sorrow" being lifted.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from guarding corrupted data to actively nurturing unauthorized life within the archive, with Kael's agency driving the transformation. The pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, though the resolution lacks a sharper edge of consequence for his choice to abandon the archive's intended function.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the wild frontier of mind—escalates through discovery of the hum's source, the gear's purpose, and culminates in the synchronized mechanism. Translocation complicates rather than resolves, forcing Elara to trust the forest's guidance. The cost is legible when she realizes "she'd spent years barricading herself from wonder."

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—seeking courage after breaking free—intensifies through the ferry crossing where "courage unused waits not in a place, but in the crossing." The star-punch creates a concrete gatekeeper mechanism. Cost becomes visible in the final transformation, though earlier pressure points could tighten more decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding safety's cost—deepens through Elara's discovery of the bolt and recognition that "safety required surrender," though escalation occurs primarily through internal realization rather than external pressure. The cost becomes legible in her choice to remain as witness rather than prisoner, but the conflict lacks the tightening pressure that would elevate the score.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from protecting secrets to the rune's manifestation to Varek's confrontation. The celestial timing creates genuine pressure. However, Varek's threat dissipates too easily without real resistance, and the resolution lacks a harder-fought victory that would heighten the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulating evidence (atlas page, tide logs, thermal readings) toward the revelation about coral scaffolds, with the "periodically eternal" storm surges providing the key insight. The cost is clear but could benefit from one more intermediate pressure point.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reigniting hope versus accepting defeat—intensifies through Elara's discovery of the stones' true nature. The meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes "the rebellion's true enemy wasn't the oligarchs, but despair," forcing a fundamental reframing. Cost manifests in abandoning violent resistance for spiritual renewal, though the ease of the collective awakening at the end slightly undercuts earned tension.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal defiance to ecological intervention as Elara moves from seeking clarity to actively unsealing the embryo. The tightening occurs when she discovers the kite's script can unlock the sealed destiny, forcing immediate choice. Cost is visible in her accepting the "insurgent" label while the land validates her as "necessary."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.3)
    Escalation follows accumulative pattern: gull cry → freeze → deepened panic → somatic grounding → return to planting. The cost is legible in "knowing the cliffs eroded steadily" yet choosing to plant anyway. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from artistic paralysis through thread-untangling to the final knotted World card representing perfectionism itself. The storm's physical pressure mirrors internal pressure effectively. Cost is visible in choosing darkness over light ("carried no lantern"), though the middle section could tighten slightly between finding and working the cards.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake - understanding why time slows in crisis - escalates through the ink experiment's unexpected persistence to forced trauma recall. Cost is legible in Silas's deliberate self-infliction of remembered panic. The revelation carries weight but lacks a second pressure point or reversal that would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from internal conflict → upload decision → enforcers arriving → hiding in pod. The dominant stake (exposing truth vs. self-preservation) tightens when enforcers burst in, forcing immediate action. Cost is legible throughout, particularly in "exposure meant cryo-preservation—a frozen tomb for dissidents."

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake (defending the farm without violence) is clear, and pressure escalates when raiders arrive with "weapons glinting dully." However, the resolution feels too easy—the raiders retreat after minimal resistance, deflating the built tension. The cost exists but lacks the weight needed for this climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from garden's hum shattering to full cosmic disorder (constellations sleepwalking), forcing Kael's desperate zigzag survival dance. The pressure coheres through sonic accumulation, with each failed harmony raising the cost. The final casting of the "net of woven silence" represents agency under maximum pressure, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth given the established chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal reputation through family legacy to journalistic integrity itself. Clara's proof-by-contradiction represents genuine agency narrowing from multiple interpretations to one truth. The cost manifests in confronting her past mistake with Ben and choosing courage over caution.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (hushing guilt) signaled early and tightens through the firmware's translation of the cry, forcing Aris to confront rather than escape. The tethering ritual shows clear agency with visible cost ("torrent of infant terror" channeled through their body). Escalation follows accumulative logic as sound pressure builds to transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake—finding meaning amid unlearning—tightens when the "emergent hush" forces Elara's wordless intervention through mandala reshaping. Cost registers in the community's visible transformation from "lilac unease" to "gentle resolve," though agency could strengthen through more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from preserving memory to exposing dangerous truth that "disarms hatred but terrifies those building monuments." The tessera discovery deepens pressure by revealing soldiers' mercy contradicts the revenge narrative. Varr's arrival with demolition crews creates immediate physical threat to the truth, though the Council's capitulation happens somewhat quickly without extended resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes crystallize around saving one life from the past disaster, with escalation through Elara's synesthetic channeling that risks her last anchor before demolition. The choice to save the child over self-preservation carries weight, and the "crushing weight of failure" transforming to "profound, rising nostalgia" marks emotional cost clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from professional failure (recall notice) through scientific discovery (somatic echoes) to collaborative breakthrough (visualizing body's language). The dominant stake—understanding what went wrong to find a new path—tightens as Aris moves from passive receipt of failure to active experimentation. Cost is visible in the "irreversible empathic bleed" and professional indictment, though the final breakthrough lacks immediate trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—mapping emotional residues to help survivors—escalates through the fossil's unexpected levitation and revelation of intentional placement. The tightening from personal talisman to collective beacon works under the textural lens. However, the lack of immediate physical or relational cost weakens urgency; the transformation feels more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—preventing catastrophe through prophecy reinterpretation—establishes early and tightens when the three brass buttons reveal themselves as coordinates. The escalation follows the accumulative lens as each button placement builds toward the revelation. However, the conflict lacks immediate external pressure; Elara works alone without time constraints or opposition, reducing dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake of redemption escalates from personal reflection to active code transmission to Mara's refusal to vouchsafe safety, forcing Elias to offer certainty instead of asking for trust. The reversal when Mara doubles the guard meaningfully tightens options. Cost is visible in three years of exile, though the final resolution arrives somewhat easily once Mara accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (safe crossing) is clear but escalation is modest—the ferry drifts, Silas mends rope, crossing completes. The mudflat threat and time pressure from rain/gutters add tension but don't meaningfully tighten options. Cost exists (risk to passengers) but remains potential rather than paid.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding why places resist change—deepens through the glass discovery and vision sequence, with one meaningful tightening when Kaito shifts from seeking to participating through his stone offering. Cost becomes legible when he accepts carrying the fragment's weight "in his bones" rather than fixing it. The escalation follows the accumulative lens appropriately, though a sharper trade-off or more visceral price would strengthen the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The dominant stake—bringing light to dangerous shadows—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Escalation occurs through the accumulation of placed shards building toward the transformation moment when "silver light spilled through the new constellation." However, there's no meaningful opposition or complication; the work proceeds smoothly from intention to completion without resistance, limiting dramatic tension despite the methodical build.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal sanity through the sundial's dangerous memories to species-level responsibility, with the stone circle offering a costly solution that transforms pain rather than erasing it. The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence while preserving the Aethon—tightens through physical descent and alignment ritual, though middle development could sharpen the trade-off between safety and honoring the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.0)
    The dominant stake of genuine connection versus borrowed sentiment escalates through Elara's shift from passive observation to active creation. The public art installation raises stakes by requiring her vulnerability, with visible cost in exposing her own secret. The accumulation of others' contributions deepens pressure effectively. Missing a sharper middle tightening that would force a harder trade-off before the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from detecting false signals to risking the station's shutdown via power surge, with Aris's agency driving each turn. The triplet pulse discovery leads to the subsonic solution, which triggers alarms that will give administrators ammunition—each consequence narrowing options with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes are clear (retrieve key to save villages) with escalation through the narrowing passages and spatial mutiny reasserting itself. The organ's intervention provides the crucial reversal that enables success. However, the resolution feels slightly convenient - the exact moment needed happens to align with the organ's playing.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from Elena's private failure through her ritual documentation to the public portrait creation that "lances the silence." The witness's emergence provides external pressure that validates her unconventional approach. Cost manifests in seven years of weekly returns and the town's dormant empathy finally awakening.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of reversing ancestral shame escalates through the deciphering process, with the nail's meaning shifting from relic to key evidence. However, the resolution lacks a dramatized test or trade-off - the insight arrives through interpretation rather than action with visible cost beyond choosing to remain.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving "broken things could grow anew"—intensifies from offering the glass fragment through decoding the tarp's message to the physical descent into the canyon. The discovery of the moss-sprouting bow provides meaningful deepening that reweights all prior fragments. Cost is visible in the dangerous descent and the emotional weight of playing despite damaged hands, though the resolution feels slightly neat.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (breaking destructive patterns) signaled early and deepened through the marking ritual that forecloses the escape option with visible cost. The tightening from panic whispers to "polished calm as shield" shows genuine escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to decode inscriptions toward understanding collective burden-sharing, with the monsoon deadline and Kael's three-year absence creating persistent pressure. The variable star Rho Lyrae entering its bright phase provides the crucial tightening that forces revelation, though the resolution could show more immediate cost beyond emotional recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—breaking the curse by confronting hidden truth—is established early and tightens as Kael must navigate the hostile vortex to reach his frozen confession. The escalation follows his expanding search circles meeting increasing resistance. The cost is visible when he shatters the confession and faces "the lake's forgotten history: a child drowning, a promise broken." However, the vortex's sudden calming feels slightly convenient despite the earned emotional beat.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate through accumulative pressure as Elara moves from examining scars to blood sacrifice to achieving the intersection of dreams, with each action narrowing her options. The roots' transformation from binding to lifting shows meaningful deepening, though the drone threat remains somewhat distant.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from carving symbols to physical entrapment as roots respond with "sudden, muscular trammel," forcing Elara's acceptance of permanent binding. The cost is legible in her transformation from seeker to trapped keeper, though the middle section could tighten the pressure buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure escalates from professional evaluation to personal reckoning as the grille cloth's true history surfaces, forcing Liam to choose between appraiser role and authentic self. The tightening occurs when facts blur into memories, narrowing his options to either maintain professional distance or reclaim personal meaning. Cost is visible in his abandonment of the appraisal form for the worn compass.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes deepen through Aris's methodical process—from spreading the tablet to aligning the seed's magnetic field to adjusting harmonic dampeners—each action narrowing his path toward understanding. The cost crystallizes when he achieves technical mastery but cannot cross into experiential knowledge of Elara's passage, foreclosing the deeper connection he seeks.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake of "preserving wonder in routine" never faces concrete opposition or test—Elara simply continues her work without meaningful obstacles or escalation. No reversal or tightening occurs; the tide cycles and moon phases create atmosphere but don't force trade-offs or narrow options.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—whether to preserve or destroy these human confessions—emerges clearly when Aris discovers the pearl. Pressure escalates from professional assessment to personal reckoning as the confessions make the abandoned hopes concrete and immediate. The cost is visible when his "professional distance...begin[s] to soften, to dissolve," though the conflict could benefit from more tangible opposition or a harder choice between competing goods.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes deepen from external documentation to internal acceptance, with the graffiti encounter forcing Elias to confront his methodical approach's futility. The accordion playing represents agency through surrender rather than control. Cost is visible in tears and the foreclosed path of trying to "undo the past" through documentation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the tightening pattern of propagation delays (9→8→7→6→5 seconds), each measurement bringing Elara closer to either revelation or collapse. The dominant stake—finding the Library of Unspoken Words—faces concrete pressure through the accelerating countdown and the threat of the second letter's arrival. Cost manifests through risk acceptance ("She'd risked everything for this moment") and the stolen watch's dark provenance.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from research to preservation to confrontation, with the solstice deadline creating genuine pressure. The coffee divination provides a meaningful tightening moment showing multiple futures. However, Elara's final surrender feels insufficiently costly—the "quiet propagation of hope" resolution undercuts the weight of losing the violin to imperial control.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear from opening—capture life's spark before oblivion swallows everything. The pattern-finding in static creates escalation through the three-beat cadence growing fainter, forcing precise timing. Cost is visible: the world dies as Elara succeeds, creating the tragic trade-off of preservation versus participation.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.4)
    The faltering grotto cycle creates genuine urgency requiring immediate action, with scallop-harvesting as the concrete solution. However, escalation plateaus after the successful ritual—no complication tests Elara's new understanding, and the sister's betrayal remains backstory without present opposition to create friction against the contentment realization.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes crystallize around Elias's need to "stop unhooking others from their convictions and finally unhook himself." The cloak removal carries visible cost through physical vulnerability. However, the pressure accumulation could be tighter - Mrs. Gable's anecdote arrives late without earlier preparation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.9)
    The central tension - Kael's frustration with withheld knowledge - generates one meaningful exchange but lacks escalation. The pond revelation arrives through Elara's orchestration rather than Kael's agency. No genuine reversal or tightening occurs; the lesson unfolds as planned without complication or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from seeking silence to reading harmonics to discovering the arrowhead's pulse-compass, with each stage narrowing his options toward stillness. The cost manifests in "centuries of layered dust" on his robes and his ultimate renunciation of the arrowhead after achieving his goal.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (finding meaning beyond automated efficiency) accumulates through texture rather than reversals, appropriate for this lens. The keystone placement creates a meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding. Cost is visible in her renunciation of possessions and former ambitions, though the middle pressure could intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from routine duty to personal quest to universal truth about sound's color. The tidal constraint creates urgency, and discovering the vows deepens pressure through emotional resonance. However, the conflict lacks a decisive trade-off or foreclosed option at closure beyond abstract enlightenment.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from colony survival to cosmic alignment through Elara's active choices - casting lots, selecting the chaotic burst, adjusting prisms. The gold coin's discovery deepens from random result to universe's tuning fork. Cost is visible in "hours distilling" and the weight of being sole decision-maker, though middle tension could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: from finding recordings to positioning the atlas to crystallizing echoes, each step deepens commitment to Kael's mission. The cost manifests in transformation—from "nameless fears" to "named terrors," with Elara accepting the weight of remembrance. One meaningful deepening sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal (shivering, mockery) through ecological (last fish, dry riverbed) to cosmic (stars winking out). The dripping rate discovery creates concrete pressure—seven seconds must become five. Cost is visible but modest: "bought time, not victory" acknowledges limitation without full resolution, appropriate for this length but lacking deeper price.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from physical discovery to emotional understanding, with the photographs deepening rather than reversing the conflict. The cost is legible in Silas's carried guilt and Elara's new burden of truth. Some passive discovery without active choice-making limits agency.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—harmonizing logic and intuition before the elixir's completion—is clear, with pressure building through repeated failure. The starlings provide the turning point, but escalation is primarily internal without external complication. The resolution arrives through observation rather than contested choice, limiting dramatic tension.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    Stakes are clear (city safety depends on vigilance) but escalation is minimal—the buckle repair resolves cleanly, then a new cable issue appears without building from the first problem. The pattern of "find problem, fix problem, find next problem" lacks meaningful tightening or deepening. Cost remains abstract ("trust preserved") rather than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.7)
    Stakes are clear—custody of the duplicate brain—but escalation relies on abstract "channeling" rather than concrete tactical shifts. The resolution through mystical vivification sidesteps rather than confronts the legal/corporate conflict, and Kael's instant capitulation ("This changes everything") lacks earned resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.6)
    The dominant stake—whether to plant this mysterious seed—faces no genuine opposition or escalation. Elias considers "orthogonal approaches" but encounters no obstacles; his decision unfolds without pressure or trade-offs. The "controlled environment" concern resolves too easily, and no competing values force a meaningful choice with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through the accumulation of sound—seven blowers roaring to life, wind macerating leaves into "golden-brown mist," lullabies fragmenting in stone. The cost appears in Elara's white knuckles and cracking voice, though the resolution arrives somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation works through density increase as the pendant's discovery forces Elara to confront her mirror-fear of the cultist. The transformation from resisting to accepting uncertainty shows clear cost. One meaningful deepening that reweights her entire stance, appropriate for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through three distinct attempts with increasing desperation, from mechanical heating to starlight infusion to the final "vivify" attempt. The cost is legible in each failure being "a hammer blow to his fragile hope," though the resolution feels slightly convenient given the established pattern of perpetual failure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from searching cosmic noise to finding the localized anomaly to physically handling the fragment to finally resonating with the silence. The lunar perigee creates genuine time pressure. The cost manifests in Elara abandoning safety protocols and her fundamental assumptions about her work.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from ferry dissolution to timeline fracture to permanent guardian duty. Leo's agency drives the resolution through pattern recognition and radio manipulation. The cost is legible: choosing eternal vigilance in the transient space ("Leo remained in the spectral grotto").

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from Elara's controlled experiment to an uncontrolled eruption affecting multiple visitors, forcing her choice between stopping or integrating the painful connections. The cost becomes tangible through the man's "It hurts" and the visible distress of other visitors. The pressure coheres well under the textural lens as the thread's texture shifts from smooth to "jagged, urgent," though the resolution feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—learning to navigate by impossible starlight—intensifies through Kael's challenge about trusting alien data after surface lies. The demonstration of edge geometry working (Vega pulsing in the hologram) provides the key deepening moment. Cost is visible in accepting drowned light as compass rather than returning to surface.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal grief counseling to life-threatening structural collapse, with the hearing aid's "frantic" pulse spike marking the tightening. Elara's agency drives the resolution through her sprint to the caretaker. The cost lands visibly in the evacuation "just as the first plaster cracks spiderwebbed." One meaningful tightening from emotional to physical danger satisfies scope requirements.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake of honoring Vale while surviving the tidal window tightens effectively when the tide returns early, forcing Arden to choose between escape and securing the data. The narrowing passage ("already shrinking, felt like a closing fist") makes the physical cost visceral, though the resolution relies somewhat on physical capability rather than a harder trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from personal survival (heartbeat counting) through technical challenge (defragmentation) to cosmic discovery (pulsar coordinates). The dominant stake—proving existence against systemic erasure—tightens when the digital ghost emerges. Cost is visible in her isolation and the irony of finding connection to cosmic rhythms while cut off from humanity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the dying language through texture-to-sound translation—is clear from the opening. Escalation builds through Kael's dance mimicking the starlings, the diamond's response, and the climactic success followed by immediate loss. The curse creates genuine risk that manifests in the diamond's destruction, though middle pressure could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (understanding/joining the Gravity Dancers) is signaled early and pressure accumulates through the herbalist's confessions and arrowhead activation. The transformation carries clear cost—losing human form/gravity. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara shifts from seeking proof to experiencing metamorphosis.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clear escalation from playing notes to commanding them, with the statue's hesitation creating a meaningful turn. The dominant stake (reawakening beauty) faces concrete opposition through the statues. Cost is visible in the statue's destruction and earth's upheaval, though the single reversal feels slightly thin for full tension.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes escalate cleanly from routine mail drop to confrontation to desperate gambit. The "Satchel mass discrepancy detected" moment tightens options effectively, forcing Aris's EMP choice. Cost is visible in both the risk taken and the "Deviation noted" consequence, though the story could push the immediate danger higher.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—breaking years of self-imposed silence—escalates through the wind bells' timeframe creating urgency, the fragment's pulse urging action, and Elias's choice to sing despite grief. Cost is visible in the tears and the years of silence broken. The "narrow window of possibility" effectively pressures the decision, though the resolution comes somewhat easily once he begins singing.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—finding "the place where stories lived"—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual sequence. The moment of reawakening ("For three suspended heartbeats, the library ceased to be a building") provides meaningful deepening with visible cost, though additional micro-reversals during the ritual could heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: from futile color-matching attempts through the breakthrough discovery to the final solstice photograph revealing recent coordinates. The dominant stake (finding the sister) tightens through each photographic revelation, with visible cost in Elara's years of isolation. The tide's daily rhythm creates natural pressure. Minor deduction as the middle section could compress slightly without losing escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to universal liberation of courage itself, with clear tightening when Aris must pour her own longing into the keyhole. The cost manifests physically through disorientation and exhaustion, and conceptually through the risk of failure. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as layers build toward the final release.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from academic curiosity through physical descent to emotional revelation, with the fairy ring touch as the decisive moment that transforms understanding. The "crisp nostalgia" sensory flood creates tangible pressure. However, no meaningful opposition or complication challenges Aris's progress—she simply swims down and touches the mushroom without obstacle or trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Stakes crystallize around reversible exile through the shard's annotation deadline, with Kael's insight providing the meaningful turn that reframes understanding. The pressure builds through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the textural lens. Cost emerges through Elara's "years" of failure and her physical stumbling, though the final transformation could carry more immediate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes signal early—the valley's dimmed spirit and "hollow eyes" establish what's at risk. Escalation builds through the ritual's deepening: physical preparation, consciousness-diving, essence-weaving, the "sudden ache" of memory that tests resolve. The cerulean's return spreading "like a silent song" provides clear resolution with visible community impact.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from releasing anonymous spirits to confronting her brother's ghost, with the silence shifting from "cold and heavy" to "burning" as personal trauma intensifies the work. The cost is legible when "the heavy silence in her palm transformed into a light, warm pulse" showing both the price paid and the release earned through facing her deepest wound.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative discovery: comparing films reveals light-shaft differences → cross-referencing maps shows sinkhole alignment → clearing the fissure tests the hypothesis → rain activates the resonance. The cost manifests as decades of silence now broken, with Elara carrying "the chapel's hum in her bones." One meaningful deepening that transforms understanding of the site.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—understanding how to let go of grief—is clear and deepens through the discovery sequence. However, escalation relies on the coincidental appearance of Eleanor's note rather than protagonist agency. The cost is felt in Silas's choice to leave the wisdom with the ocean, but the convenience of the resolution undermines earned pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from decoding messages to establishing connection to teaching song, with Elara's agency driving each step through chalk drawing and singing. The cost of breaking years of silence is palpable. The ghost's needs deepen organically from "hunger" to "I miss the sun" to "Teach me to sing."

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.2)
    Tension builds through the elevator's ascent as time pressure meets discovery urgency, with each floor marking progression. The dominant stake of finding meaning in servitude deepens through Varek's entries, though the steward's "impatient frown" provides minimal external pressure at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—proving empty spaces remember—escalates through the broken tether creating isolation, then oxygen warnings adding urgency. The discovery of the spiral pattern provides meaningful deepening that reweights Elara's understanding. The "quietly explosive" tension between scientific heresy and personal grief creates authentic pressure, though the resolution arrives somewhat abruptly without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation follows accumulative logic: discovery of safe → decoding through touch → attempting impossible precision → failure that reveals the human limit. The dawn machinery's rumble adds external pressure, though internal stakes could tighten further. Cost registers in the failed mirror and acceptance of limitation.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (charting discovery to escape isolation) signaled early and deepens through pattern recognition. The escalation follows accumulative logic: noticing patterns → connecting to phrasebook → realizing correlation → triangulating position. Cost is legible (stranded another night, emotional isolation) though not severe. The pressure coheres well under the textural lens but lacks a sharp reversal or higher-stakes tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from general repair duty to preventing "perpetual twilight" as the eclipse reaches totality. The pressure tightens when Elara must choose between force and communion, with the prophecy fragments narrowing her options. Cost is visible in her physical exhaustion and the forfeiture of her warmer past, though the exact consequence of failure could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from individual doubt to collective mobilization, with water as clear survival necessity. The ghost's messages create accumulating pressure through proven reliability. Cost shows in physical labor and exhaustion. Deduction for resolution depending on convenient hidden resource rather than character-driven trade-offs, and pressure could tighten more decisively in the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.1)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: clock stuttering → pane of hush falling → gears grinding to halt → final ripple approaching. The cost manifests physically (aging decades) and emotionally (centuries of failed adjustments). The nested patterns create genuine textural deepening that reweights the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.9)
    Time pressure (frost deadline) drives escalation as travelers arrive and birds patrol, forcing Elara to act. The breath-path method shows agency under constraint, with visible stakes (travelers' lives, Elara's soul). However, the resolution lacks a decisive cost or trade-off—the travelers escape cleanly and Elara simply continues her duty without transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.3)
    The dominant stake (processing grief/guilt) is clear from the opening, with one meaningful deepening when foam patterns trigger his polymer insight. However, the transformation lacks intermediate pressure points—Aris moves from observation to epiphany without sufficient resistance or complication that would create true escalation under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal search to fundamental understanding of creation itself. The pressure builds through accumulation: empty library → hollow promise → yearning light → measured void → revelation. Cost is visible in dropping the "lies" of her slates, though the transformation could face more resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory-smoothing to absorbing centuries of collective remorse, forcing the choice to "drown or distill" with clear cost. The transformation through cooking meaningfully tightens options and the communal sharing shows visible price paid, though the resolution feels slightly neat for the scale of absorbed suffering.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    Stakes center on reconnecting city and farmland through restoring the clock's rhythm. Pressure builds as Eliska climbs, struggles with the frozen weight, then achieves harmonic dialogue between clock and elevator. However, the resolution feels somewhat convenient—the elevator responds immediately without established mechanism. Cost exists in physical strain and emotional release but lacks a meaningful trade-off or foreclosed option.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal transformation to collective duty as Aris processes increasingly painful memories ("children laughing in a sun-drenched meadow that no longer existed"). The cost manifests physically through the "synaptic storm" and emotionally through witnessing lost dreams. The pressure coheres well under the accumulative lens as density increases toward the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake (retrieving forgotten combinations before gravity restores) creates time pressure that tightens once. Agency manifests through the archivist's decision to risk entry and her swift copying under deadline. However, the conflict lacks a meaningful reversal or complication—she succeeds without significant opposition beyond the time limit.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation as each strummed crack releases increasingly complex frequencies, from single notes to full harmonies, with the grove itself joining the performance. The cost—"the stress cracks will widen, the wood will splinter further under the strain"—is explicit and shapes Aris's final gentle caress, though the pressure could tighten more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes center on proving the covenant's hidden truth through celestial correlation, with escalation as the nexus pulses stronger and stars emerge to reveal the pattern. The tutor's agency drives discovery through precise board placement and star-tracking, with visible cost in his exile and solitary practice. The shooting star's revelation of "the bishop's diagonal cutting through the heart of the opposition" represents meaningful deepening that reweights his understanding, though physical conflict remains absent.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frequency lock creates genuine obstacle requiring multiple attempts, with each failed tuning fork generating new understanding ("silence of withheld forgiveness") that accumulates toward solution. The escalation from mechanical problem-solving to emotional revelation feels earned, with the grandmother's diary providing stakes beyond mere curiosity, though the final "heal the world" ambition inflates without concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (cultivating true serenity) deepens meaningfully when the gale forces Elara to release control, narrowing her options from imposed order to trusting natural rhythm. The seed's transformation from "mocking void" to sprouting leaf shows clear escalation with visible cost in the shattered pot and abandoned methods.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (discovering resilience's source) tightens through navigation challenges, the hidden cove discovery, and the arrow tip's revelation. Cost is visible in the "cold" contrast between weapon and growth, and the transformation of failure into strength. The escalation through water flow intensification to echo gathering works under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as wind readings intensify from 60 knots to the 10,000-pound force revelation, with the container's groan/shift forcing rapid adaptation. The dominant stake (preventing future disasters through understanding) tightens when she realizes "the labyrinth itself was a dynamic hazard." Cost is legible in the town's absence and the engineer's death.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.4)
    The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early but faces no meaningful opposition or tightening. The sculptor's chisel provides timing pressure but no competing force threatens Kael's success. The "sculpted hush" manifests but without visible trade-off or foreclosed option that would demonstrate true cost.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—understanding her catastrophic failure—intensifies through the flute's failed resonance, which "died instantly, swallowed by the avalanchingly quiet." The escalation from attempted control to surrender represents meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. However, the single-beat structure limits dramatic escalation, though the cost of abandoning her entire guardianship methodology is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    Stakes escalate from personal identity confusion to potential contamination of the entire town's printed materials. The pressure coheres under the accumulative lens as each transposed emotion deepens Aris's understanding. Cost is visible in abandoning the mathematical quest, though the middle section could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (overcoming paralyzing fear through wonder) escalates from external dread to internal transformation. The flower encounter creates meaningful deepening as Kael chooses to engage despite fear, with clear cost in confronting Vanya's absence and accepting his new role.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—faces one meaningful deepening when the frost pattern reveals projection rather than absorption. The "shifted hush" effectively marks this turn, though escalation could be sharper; the revelation arrives somewhat smoothly without sufficient resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: failed attempts → despair → puzzle discovery → final sacrifice. The cost is unmistakable ("pulling her towards the impossible distance"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the puzzle pieces transform the loom's capacity, forcing the ultimate choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—healing Veridia through sacrifice—tightens when Kael realizes he must offer "his deepest vulnerability" as payment. The cost manifests physically ("searing cold shot up his arms") and permanently ("the silence within him"), though the conflict lacks opposing pressure beyond Kael's internal hesitation.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure as realities layer and bleed together, culminating in witnessing Lyra's sacrifice. The "cyclically spontaneous" machinery creates physical danger (hydraulic arm) that raises stakes. Cost is unmistakable in Lyra's voluntary obliteration and Elara's inherited burden.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory to collective safety as "ships would drift toward the teeth of Blackrock Point." The pressure coheres through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate to the lens. Cost is visible in accepting the light's failure while maintaining the watch through alternative means.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes escalate from routine maintenance to world-threatening failure when the storm disrupts the reflection method. The rogue wave creates genuine reversal requiring Elara to reinterpret "broken light" as amplification. However, the abstract nature of "shaping dawn" and "ancient shadows" dulls the visceral impact of potential failure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding why people magnetize stories—deepens through the wing experiment leading to the journal discovery, which reframes Elara's entire quest. Cost is visible in her abandoning her extractive approach. The child's question at the end tests her new understanding, though middle sections could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: pin drop → sextant discovery → journal revelation → tree reading → acceptance. The dominant stake (understanding his wife's disappearance) faces meaningful pressure when the oak reveals not witnessed events but absorbed sorrow, forcing Aris to reframe his entire quest.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory loss to realm dissolution, with pressure building through discovered song fragments. The shift from seeking "grand hymns" to recognizing "lullabies, work songs, whispered promises" as the true method represents meaningful deepening. Cost is visible as Elara pours "every ounce of her being" into the final note, though agency could be stronger in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate through time pressure (five minutes to midnight) forcing crystallization between continued isolation or joining the Circle, with cost visible in "panic, cold and sudden" and the final acceptance of vulnerability. The discovered book serves as catalyst rather than resolution, maintaining agency.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Under the accumulative lens, pressure builds through layered losses (baker, florist, school) and Elara's pattern of noticing/planting/discovering deepens to acceptance. The locket discovery represents meaningful intensification, transforming her guilt into "tenuous absolution." Cost is visible in what she cannot restore—only tend—though the escalation could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving the last luminous vow before oblivion—is signaled early and tightens through the risk of fracturing the vow's meaning ("one misalignment, and the vow's meaning would fracture into noise"). Escalation occurs through deepening technical precision as Elara measures specific frequencies, though agency remains limited to careful execution rather than decisive choice. The cost manifests in the predecessor's failure haunting the present action.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation works through accumulating false starts that each waste precious time before sunrise, with the dominant stake (capturing betrayal's sound) consistently pressured. The final violence eruption delivers the sought recording but with the cost of hollow victory. The "truce of hush" creates coherent pressure that builds through near-breaks to actual shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from scientific curiosity to understanding humanity's survival mechanism, with the carriers' convergence creating visible atmospheric tension. The cost is conceptually clear (humanity broke the weather, carriers must hold it) though the personal cost to Aris could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    Escalation follows textural accumulation: village laughter fading→cave hum intensifying→lock discovery→hidden truth revealed→creative dam breaking. The pressure coheres through sensory intensification ("physical pressure against her skin"). Cost is visible in tears and the "vessel finally filled," though the middle section could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from finding sealant to discovering the map to confronting Ben's dishonesty, each narrowing Elara's options. The truth-telling mechanism forces genuine trade-offs. Cost is visible when she wilts from Ben's lies yet must continue alone.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate through the narrowing window between autumn's wordlessness and winter's muteness, forcing Elara to complete her work in this liminal moment. The community's gathering and physical response to the symphony demonstrates tangible impact, though a sharper mid-story tightening would strengthen escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Escalation builds cleanly: dome cracks → Aris realizes escape pod won't work → channels storm into box → controlled burn escape. The dominant stake (saving the roses) faces genuine pressure with visible cost (dome's collapse). The tightening from full-scale farm to seed-sized essence works under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.6)
    Stakes center on unlocking both the physical mailbox and metaphorical community wounds, with escalation through accumulating memories. The tightening occurs when collective storytelling reveals Anita's true fate, though agency feels distributed rather than driven by Elara's choices. Cost lands in communal tears and healing.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Rising water creates coherent escalation under the accumulative lens, from "seeping steadily" to "lapped at her knees." The dance-cipher solution represents meaningful deepening that transforms abstract fear into embodied knowledge. Cost is legible as Elara accepts the flooding lab's loss while securing the algorithms.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal memory loss to discovering the systematic nature of "memory wells," with the gravity pockets' increasing pull creating physical urgency. The cost manifests in Aris's acceptance that retrieval means transformation, not restoration. The tightening from random forgetting to targeted excavation to final release works, though the mother's convenient parallel journey slightly undermines earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation follows the accumulative lens effectively - from hearing coded whispers to mapping silence nodes to the wing absorbing sound, pressure builds through density increase. The prophecy's resistance ("symbols glowed faintly...fighting the hush") provides opposition. However, the conflict lacks a moment where Elara might genuinely fail; success feels predetermined despite the "sweat beaded on her brow."

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—understanding Vale's true teaching about buildings' language—deepens through Mrs. Thorne's revelation and Vale's letter, forcing Elara to reconfigure her approach from "interrogating" to accepting shared fiction. However, external pressure is minimal; the conflict is primarily internal realization without active opposition or meaningful tightening of options.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear - freeing herself from a suffocating memory - and the ritual provides structured escalation through calibrated steps. The cost manifests in tears and the permanent separation from the memory. However, the conflict lacks significant obstacles or reversals; the ritual proceeds too smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes are clear - correcting historical injustice without exposing the restoration project. Pressure builds through the precision required and generational weight. The tightening occurs when she positions the thorn, but the resolution lacks significant on-page resistance or complication once the action begins.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake (understanding why some echo) is clear, with one meaningful tightening when Renn reveals the genetic suppression. However, escalation relies heavily on exposition rather than dramatized pressure, and Kaela's decision to sing feels more declared than forced by the accumulated tension.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—exposing hidden truth versus preserving dignity—escalates through accumulating dream fragments that reveal deeper fractures (storm→structural fatigue→collective lie). The revelation about silencing Finn's warnings creates meaningful pressure that reweights earlier material. Cost is visible in Elara's frozen tears and the crew's "fatal deception," though the resolution feels slightly neat with all pieces fitting perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on Kenji's quest to perceive hidden patterns, with escalation through discovery (shadow patterns → stone harmonics → ritual acknowledgment). While the accumulative pressure builds, the conflict lacks genuine resistance—each discovery arrives too easily without setback or doubt, reducing dramatic tension despite the philosophical depth.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake—uncovering truth about the orchards—escalates from curiosity to moral imperative as Lena discovers "the deliberate architecture of their suffering." The tightening occurs when she realizes the liquidation was intentional sacrifice, not accident. Cost manifests in her physical burden of carrying this knowledge and the isolation of walking alone into the storm.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from passive monitoring to active intervention as radio fragments reveal the Prophet will destroy the Portico, threatening atmospheric collapse. The tightening occurs when Elara must choose between her former faith and using forbidden "ancient shadows." Cost is visible: risking detection by the sky-cutter to save the world.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.6)
    The music box discovery escalates from physical isolation to emotional connection, with the child's arrival deepening this transformation. Cost is visible in Silas's tears and the "abyss of loneliness" he bridges. The stake of generational connection tightens when he chooses to capture forward rather than backward, though middle development could intensify further.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate cleanly: ice groans louder → sunset shrinks → Tower shudders violently → resolution. The sunset timer creates genuine pressure that narrows options. Agency manifests through Aris's precise adaptation rather than force. Cost appears in physical toll and the temporary nature of the solution ("temporary, peaceful stillness").

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulation: from Elara's solitary mapping to villagers gathering, from the young man's hammer-gripped anger to collective circling, culminating in chains falling "link by link." The cost is legible in both the years of patient waiting and the immediate choice to reject violent revolution for "softly purposeful" change.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from routine investigation to confronting systemic corruption through concrete discoveries. The scalpel and footprint narrow options toward inevitable confrontation. Cost is visible in risking career ("consequences be damned"), though the supervisor's direct involvement feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake (delivering Elias's apology) escalates through the broken mechanism's "hairline fracture" threatening total destruction, then deepens when Father Michael realizes he carries his own guilt. The cost lands visibly in tears and the weight of "purpose settle[d] into his bones," though the resolution arrives somewhat smoothly once Mrs. Gable succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (ringing the unhearable bell) signaled early with meaningful deepening when Zephyr realizes the bell requires "pure yearning" not calculation, forcing trade-off between technical mastery and embodied feeling. Cost is legible: twenty years of algorithmic pursuit must be abandoned for visceral yearning. Minor deduction for relatively linear escalation without major reversal, though this fits the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal investigation to systemic conspiracy as Elara discovers the archive's true nature. The physical confrontation with Vance provides a concrete pressure point. However, the escalation feels rushed in the final third, and Vance's sudden appearance lacks the building tension that would make his intervention feel inevitable rather than convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from abstract distrust to Kael's raised fist threatening violence, with the "weighted breath before reply" creating palpable tension. The crystal's revelation transforms imminent conflict into reconciliation with clear cost—Kael's shame, his wife's tears. One meaningful deepening that reweights all prior suspicion into tragic misunderstanding.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Escalation operates through accumulative pressure—each shovelful, each sound builds toward the ice crack revelation. The near-miss with the fissure forces stance crystallization: she hadn't been hearing endings approach but was already within them. Stakes tighten from seeking death to learning endings' language, with visible cost in her transformed relationship to destruction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (understanding isolation versus connection) deepens through accumulation rather than reversal, appropriate for the textural lens. The letter's discovery creates genuine pressure that forces Elara to crystallize her stance on "destined mismatches." Cost is visible in her acceptance that understanding grows "in the spaces where destinies brush, burn, and leave their edges beautifully, necessarily, apart."

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (preserving the prophet's words) established early with meaningful escalation as the clearing threatens to dissolve. The protagonist's agency drives resolution through active consecration ritual. Cost is visible but somewhat muted—exhaustion is shown but the broader implications of failure remain abstract rather than viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    The dominant stake—transforming private grief into collective strength—remains consistent but escalation is gentle rather than pressured, following the accumulative lens through photograph arrangement to community gathering. Cost is visible (Elara's surrendered photo, Leo's brother's jersey) but the conflict lacks meaningful opposition or complication. The story achieves its single deepening through the shift from Elara's solitary work to communal participation, though this feels more like completion than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—proving language's organic growth—escalates through the crystal's accelerating sequences from single syllables to complex fracturing. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens as sounds build from "verdant" to "dictionary" shattering into components. Deduction for relatively low external stakes and the convenience of the bird's call triggering acceleration without earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Escalation builds through accumulating losses—forgetting the tire swing location, seeing "the log, then static," finally losing the plink's meaning entirely. The dominant stake of capturing proof before forgetting tightens as each attempt dissolves, though the circular nature prevents a fully decisive foreclosure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes escalate from equipment malfunction through personal despair to breakthrough realization, with the tremors forcing increasingly desperate responses. The cost is legible: Aris must surrender his thirty-year pursuit of freezing time to instead dance within its current. The leaf sound provides meaningful deepening that reweights his entire approach.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—achieving meaningful closure before death—is signaled immediately and tightens through Elara's protocol-breaking decision to move Aris outside. The vinyl fragment creates genuine risk (it might not play, might traumatize rather than heal) that pays off when it triggers Aris's profound reconnection. Cost is visible in the tear, trembling hand, and ultimate release, though escalation relies more on accumulation than reversal under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes center on preventing the isle's destruction through careful loop-closing, with personal stakes (finding Varn) nested within. The pressure accumulates through textural detail rather than reversals—each corrected rune brings risk of "shattering the fragile equilibrium." However, the actual correction work proceeds without meaningful complication or resistance, limiting escalation to knowledge gain rather than contested action.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dominant stake (transforming skepticism into guiding wisdom) is clear, with meaningful deepening through the bone-setting parallel. However, present-scene conflict is minimal - mostly reflection and gentle conversation. The three-year changeling substitution provides backstory weight but lacks active present pressure beyond Elara's internal processing.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The dominant stake—creating flameless light to serve the fire-fearing village—is clear but lacks present-scene escalation. The conflict remains largely internal and retrospective, with the actual polishing and village illumination happening without meaningful resistance or complication. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through present struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.3)
    The dominant stake of transforming wound to connection intensifies through the fractal discovery, though escalation feels gentle rather than pressurized. The cost of vulnerability registers when Elara offers the pendant, but the lack of resistance from any quarter slightly dampens tension.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving hopes versus accepting transience) escalates through increasingly difficult cameos—from child's amber orb to soldier's splintered star that won't hold. The realization that "hopes were ephemeral by design" forces Elias to change tactics from capturing to blessing. Cost is visible in the released younger-self hope and the acceptance of incompleteness. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes escalate from personal quest to land restoration when the incomplete songs threaten failure, forcing Elara to risk her grandfather's final secret. The cosmic timing constraint (century-rare alignment) creates genuine urgency, and the cost is visible through years of failure and the grandfather's death, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—preserving Lina's memory before it fades—tightens through the eclipse's brief window of opportunity. Escalation builds through accumulation: arranging debris, feeling the tree's pulse, etching the map, then the careful ignition. The cost manifests in accepting preservation over resurrection, memory over presence, sealed with "frozen tears."

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes center on capturing echoes before winter freezes them "solid, lost forever," creating genuine time pressure. The escalation works through accumulation as Elara discovers the alignment principle, then applies it with millimeter precision. Cost becomes tangible when capturing Silas's voice triggers tears she must suppress to complete the work.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—collecting calcified burdens while bearing her own—escalates through two distinct collections, each requiring more precise ritual and extracting greater cost. The progression from teardrop stone to rope-shaped betrayal shows meaningful deepening. The final sealing of the grotto by snowfall creates irreversible pressure, though agency in the final beat could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through textural accumulation: from holding blank wood to first cut to emerging figure, each action deepening engagement with loss. The kettle's whistle creates temporal pressure, forcing her to choose between continuing work and answering its call. Cost is visible in tears and the "rough but undeniably alive" carving, though the stakes could tighten more dramatically through the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Stakes escalate through fragment accumulation (ninety-eight to hundred), with each discovery deepening Elara's regret. The final negotiation crystallizes her choice between holding on and letting go.

    The dominant stake (reconciling with abandoned perfection) escalates through the bear's arrival, forcing Elias from routine maintenance into existential confrontation. The "glacial hush" deepens from emptiness to "held note" to inner warmth. Cost is visible in accepting imperfection "as part of the design," though the resolution feels slightly too neat for the setup's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from seeking legend to understanding deception to dismantling lies "brick by brick," with the dominant stake (understanding the architecture of lies) tightening through discovery. The cost is legible in her decade lost to falsehood, though agency remains primarily intellectual rather than forcing harder trade-offs between competing values.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=6.8)
    Stakes are clear—ancient methods will vanish without preservation—and pressure builds through the rope's complexity and time's weight. The discovery of "deep-rooted endurance" advances knowledge meaningfully.

Cost is legible in "the intimate act...both burden and sacrament."

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are signaled early—reawakening beauty in a sterile world—and escalate through the assembly sequence where each component becomes "a prayer against the cold certainty of extinction." The hatching scene tightens pressure as the palace shakes and dust rains, forcing Elian to confront not triumphant restoration but "a beauty born of fracture." The cost lands viscerally: his tears are "hot and silent" as he accepts the imperfect result.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—proving scars can sing—deepens through the grafting sequence and culminates in hearing the harmonic hum.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake (liberating memories before city becomes "shell of blank faces") is clear and tightens through the breadcrumb trail to the ritual. The geese's pause creates temporal pressure. Cost is visible in seventeen years waited and emotional release at closure, though the actual conflict lacks active opposition—more quest than struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—preserving light without fire to nurture fragile worlds—faces escalating pressure through the sonar's discovery of grandmother's faint garden and Elara's response of scattering more seeds. The cost accumulates through crystallizing tears and the weight of generational responsibility. However, the conflict lacks a sharp tightening moment; the discovery confirms rather than complicates her mission.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    Escalation accumulates through textural deepening: from individual tracing to ribbon-tying to monarchs reconfiguring into "a bowl, cupping the space where his family once sat." The dominant stake—understanding grief's true shape—tightens as Silas moves from stone-carver's solitary craft to accepting collective memory. Cost manifests in the first tears since the funeral, though Corvin's arrival feels slightly convenient.

Cost appears in the "weight of understanding" and responsibility Elara accepts.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    The dominant stake—proving "life could persist even here" through predictive modeling—is clear early and tightens through escalating precision requirements. The piece shows meaningful deepening as Elias moves from months of study to the moment of action, with clear cost articulated ("flood villages or deepen the freeze"). However, escalation relies heavily on told stakes rather than dramatized pressure, and no on-page reversal or complication tests his resolve during the scene itself.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes build from personal mission to world-changing act as dust begins telling stories. The tension between authorities' Famine Laws and the pirate broadcast creates genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (preserving memory against oblivion) is signaled early and deepens through the Eleanor backstory, with the rocking chair's cessation forcing closure. The cost is legible (decade-long vigil ending, gallery closing). However, the conflict lacks external pressure—Elara faces no opposition or complication beyond her own acceptance, limiting escalation under the textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dominant stake of preserving rational knowledge versus accepting simplified myths is signaled early and tested through Kael's confrontation.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal refuge-seeking to ensemble transformation through the rosette discovery that reframes the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from power outage to drone failure to Elara's forced revelation of the solution. The truth compulsion creates genuine pressure that narrows her options. Cost is visible when she must reveal even "the part about the riddle" against social awkwardness.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from curiosity to urgent need as Elara tests three houses, with the Finnegan place representing the highest emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes escalate from personal awakening through historical revelation to structural healing, with each discovery narrowing Aelius's options toward the threading solution.

The cost is legible: they may save some scrolls but acknowledge this might be "the last rising," accepting partial loss while refusing total surrender.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through discovery (yoyo), decoding (reverse-engineering), and application (pressing yoyo to stone), with the tide's return creating natural urgency.

Cost is legible in the "terrifyingly unwritten" future, though the middle section could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake (escaping fear's trap through understanding its weakness) escalates from passive awakening to active confrontation, with Clara's agency driving the resolution through photographing herself. Cost is visible in embracing the curse and confronting death-fear. The paradox mechanism creates coherent pressure, though the advisor's guidance reduces some earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    Escalation builds through accumulating sonic layers as the storm intensifies, with the massive wave serving as the peak test. The protagonist's agency drives the transformation, though the resolution could show more lasting physical cost beyond exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate from passive mapping to active discovery when the whistle reveals the hidden path, forcing Kael from observer to participant.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.1)
    Stakes are declared (preventing another disaster) but the actual conflict remains abstract - Elara faces no active opposition or meaningful obstacles in this scene. The escalation is intellectual rather than dramatized, with her simply assembling parallels without resistance or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes deepen through physical struggle (wresting the cornerstone) to emotional discovery (watercolors revealing lost dreams).

Cost is visible in physical strain and the weight of inherited purpose, though the resolution lacks a sharper trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—uncovering honest origins versus accepting official history—develops through accumulating evidence. Pressure builds as Elara discovers inconsistencies, forms her hypothesis, and must choose between comfortable lies and difficult truth. The cost manifests in her complete methodological overhaul. However, there's no significant opposition or complication beyond the documents themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation as Elara moves from passive crane-folding to active gem-polishing, with each stage extracting higher emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through the geode's progression from cold object to warm sensor to erupting with Elara's tangible presence, forcing Aris to confront "the bleakness of his loss" intertwined with "exhilaration" at proof. The cost is unmistakable when he chooses to map all pools while "tears evaporating in the geode's warmth."

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake of finding belonging escalates through the precise timing requirement when "star trails converged," creating genuine pressure. The cost is visible in Elara's years of searching and her dissolved squadron. However, the resolution relies heavily on the device working as hoped rather than Elara making a difficult choice between competing goods, limiting agency at the crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes escalate from general guilt to specific discovery of the watch hand to the crushing realization of direct causality in Elara's death.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes center on whether Aris can transform his guilt into meaningful action through this exchange. The "furrowed hush" where "one shouted word could reignite the war" creates palpable tension.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are clear: reconciliation versus continued isolation, with the dominant tension between Leo's nautical identity and his failures as a father. The utility poles create escalating pressure through accumulated memories, each tightening the emotional vise. The cost is legible when he lets the compass sink and chooses shore over sea. However, the conflict lacks a decisive middle tightening—memories accumulate but don't force intermediate choices.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (proving capacity for selflessness vs. freedom) established early with clear escalation through path choices. The right-turn decision shows agency foreclosing the easier option with physical cost (submerged swimming, burning lungs). Finding the girl raises stakes from personal freedom to another's salvation. Cost manifests in sacrificing his only possession and choosing to carry her rather than race alone to freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    The dominant stake (reconnecting with Kaelen) is clear, and pressure deepens through the spice-gathering ritual. However, escalation feels somewhat predetermined—no genuine obstacles complicate Elara's path once she interprets the fortune. The cost is felt but the journey lacks meaningful resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (reclaiming lost maternal time) deepens through the ritual's progression from spreading cloth to tracing hand to pouring ink.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal shadow work to collective liberation as "shadows pressed closer, whispering of souls fraying at the edges," creating urgency that drives the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=4.3)
    Stakes remain abstract—"understanding transformation" never faces concrete test or opposition. The child's fever provides external purpose but no actual conflict emerges. Escalation is absent; the volcano calms through coincidence rather than Aris's agency, and no meaningful choice narrows his options.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are clear from opening—spark the revolution before dawn. The blackout creates time pressure and the sundial operation provides a concrete test with "a single misalignment could send the wrong signal, dooming them all." However, Elara faces no actual opposition or complication during execution; the guards remain conveniently confused throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    Escalation builds through accumulative pressure: failed stone sequences, intensifying visions, then surrender leading to revelation.

Cost is legible in the temporary nature of the revelation and the ongoing burden of seeking.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—understanding the cartography of scars—evolves from external observation to internal revelation through the storm-timing ritual. Escalation occurs through accumulation: each timed interval reveals deeper meaning until the final realization that "scars were not wounds but waypoints." Cost is legible in the physical scars, lost career, and Elara's disappearance, though the resolution leans slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from diplomatic tension to physical duel, with Silas using combat movements to solve the sundial puzzle - a clever integration. However, Vorlag's instant capitulation after being "stunned by the revelation" lacks the resistance that would heighten cost; the resolution feels slightly too convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes escalate from personal survival through hidden verse-planting to public recruitment, with the Architect accepting increased exposure despite authorities hunting the "Penny Poet." The shift from hiding verses to scattering blank papers meaningfully tightens risk, though middle development could sharpen the cost of this choice.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Escalation builds through time pressure (horizon darkening), discovery (film's hidden sections reveal static pathways not arbor paths), and Elara's shift from repair to sonic mimicry. The protagonist's agency drives each turn, with visible cost in risking her only refuge on an untested method as "time was bleeding away."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Stakes clearly established: save collective memory before monsoon destroys the ridge. Meaningful tightening occurs when Elara connects dream interpretation to Lyra's song, narrowing options to this specific ritual. Cost is visible in the final flood of ancestral memories and Elara's weeping. The monsoon deadline creates consistent pressure, though the resolution feels slightly too smooth given the established "luminous doubt."

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake—reconciling with unforgivable loss—escalates through the compass's intensifying glow revealing the lace's hidden instructions, forcing Kai to confront his withheld warning. The cost is legible in his admission that "Pride had been his anchor, dragging them all down," though the resolution through metaphorical understanding rather than concrete action slightly softens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: her decision to polish the geode deepens the stake from passive folding to active transformation. Cost is legible as she is "carved apart" by the process. One meaningful intensification suffices. Minor deduction: the shadow's detachment is backstory, not on-page pressure, slightly diluting immediate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven by agency under the Accumulative lens: Aris's decision to rerun the perturbation sequence on the geode's signature is a meaningful deepening that changes knowledge.

The final, decisive turn—the deflection and revelation—is a direct result of Silas's tactical positioning and prior deciphering, fully earning the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.1)
    The dominant stake (the resistance) is signaled early and escalates through a meaningful cadence shift: from writing a single verse to the decisive act of scattering them, a tactical change that forecloses the safety of mere hiding.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres as an internal stake: whether to serve spectacle or honor gradual truth. Escalation occurs via density and pattern—dust mapping to neutron star analogy—culminating in a stance crystallization. The price (foreclosing the path of drama and institutional approbation) is felt but not sharply tested, keeping the tightening modest. Still, the cadence shift near the end lands.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are focused—survival and understanding why she was targeted—and pressure coheres as attention becomes tactic. The meaningful tightening is the frost‑to‑vial discovery that narrows options and deepens understanding. The price is implicit (time, injury, exposure), but the scene stops short of a hard trade‑off on the page. Tension is steady rather than spiking, suiting a quiet reconstruction but capping intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.0)
    The dominant stake—translating silence into music—tightens through one meaningful turn when the quartz resonator reframes the problem. Pressure is coherent, and the botanist’s fluctuating signature provides a live test. However, opposition is gentle and the solution arrives without much resistance or visible cost, keeping escalation below a higher band. The price is largely conceptual (abandoning sound), not acutely dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and legible—granting rest to the unburied dead—and the pressure coheres as he descends and works under the ocean’s claim. The meaningful tightening is the choice to use the crack as a prism, transforming a flaw into a tactic with consequence. The cost—ongoing maintenance, deferred rest—reads at the end. Escalation is steady rather than sharp, but appropriate for the length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stakes (survival and cultural continuity) are clear, with a meaningful tightening when Elias chooses to chime despite risk. Pressure is steady rather than spiky; the run succeeds without interruption, so escalation relies on cadence and thematic intensification. The final act is an endurance/renunciation blend (quietly asserting continuity) with a legible price. A sharper on‑page complication would heighten the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—redeeming withheld compassion—tightens through the breathing sequence and the choice to deploy the tear with the lens. The escalation is a single decisive deepening rather than a series of reversals, which suits the lens. The cost is internal and conceptual rather than externally risky, but it’s legible. Tension is quiet yet coherent and builds to the charged keystone strike.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—escape/repair vs losing memories—tightens as Aris moves from observation to grabbing the fragment. The act triggers an irreversible cost and narrows options (collapse, ejection). Pressure coheres under the causal lens with a decisive intensification at the disintegration beat. Internal and external conflicts align without dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is clear and present early; siege pressure coheres and intensifies with each structural shudder. The meaningful tightening arrives as the wall starts to give, forcing immediate decoding and then the irreversible act of shielding the seeds. Price is legible in her bodily sacrifice under the beam. One could want a sharper mid‑scene reversal, but the escalation is coherent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes are singular and legible early: find the exact sound of trust breaking. Escalation under the accumulative lens is the pattern of filtration toward a single rupture (the ping) that deepens cost. Agency is steady—she chooses to build, connect, and strip away expected noise—leading to an outcome that hurts as it satisfies. A sharper micro‑loss or risk pre‑activation might heighten pressure, but the cadence shift suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—decode and descend before light shifts—and tightens with the discovery of Platform Zero/Track 13. The golden-hour window and moonrise deadline create a soft clock, and the shift from theft to self-revelation is a meaningful deepening. However, external opposition is absent, and risk is largely atmospheric, muting felt cost. The escalation is elegant but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—protecting the nascent project and its purpose under environmental duress—is clear. Escalation arrives via the crack and flooding, foreclosing the option to continue in the sanctuary and forcing the trade‑off of leaving tools. The external and internal conflicts interweave: his playful narration strains into “forced cheer” as he renounces the refuge. The visible price fuels the reorientation toward community deployment of the orbs.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaim agency by exposing sabotage—is clear and tightens through the decoding breakthrough to the public accusation. Internal fear escalates the cost of the external choice. Lack of an on‑page antagonist response limits visible pushback, but the risk is legible and the narrowing of options reads. The send‑it‑to‑everyone move forecloses retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (finish the map before the light dies) is clear and tightened by the countdown to the last star. Escalation arises through deepening attention to silence rhythms, culminating in the total blackout. The price is conceptual endurance rather than injury or loss, but it reads on the page. A slightly sharper on‑page trade‑off would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—tracing thought’s origin—tightens through the choice to play, triggering amalgamation and the no-more-loops stance. The escalation is inward and singular; resistance is largely absent, so tension remains gentle. Visible price: the last loop and the melting instrument as a relinquishment image. Effective but not grueling.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—whether to remain in complicit silence or intervene—tightens when the decoded doodles reveal live mistrust and the forecourt amplifies voices. The decisive act (stepping out, offering items) forecloses her safe anonymity. Cost is subtle but legible; pressure coheres without contrivance. Slightly soft escalation compared to top-tier pieces, but effective for the mode.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—art vs. accounting—appears early and coheres; escalation arrives as a density deepening (forget‑me‑nots leaning, ivy greening, late white rose) under the accumulative lens. The on‑page counterpressure of the glowing “8%” holds. However, there is limited narrowing of options or visible price paid in scene; endurance is the choice, but no live path is explicitly foreclosed here. Strong, quiet pressure rather than a decisive squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—prove the theory without tripping alarms or disrupting the roost—is clear and tightens once with the lever pull and its reverberations. Escalation is restrained by design (a “subdued awakening”), which suits the piece but limits palpable peril; no plan‑threatening complication arises after initiation. The cost remains largely conceptual; nevertheless, agency decisively drives the turn. Tension works more through precarious precision than opposition.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—decoding before dissolution—and tightens when the images start changing, forcing the droplet tactic and a swift exit. Escalation is internal and environmental rather than antagonistic, yet it narrows options credibly. The felt price (risk, loss if the booklet disintegrates) is clear though not severe. The resolution stems from his agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—can truth be measured and borne—tightens through one meaningful deepening: the accidental smudge becomes the cost and redefinition. Pressure grows coherently from fever tremor to calibration attempt to the irreversible flaw. The resolution is a renunciation of erasure, accepting lasting distortion. Minorly, external stakes remain soft, but the internal consequence is legible and sufficient for the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten from idle debunking to confronting the embodied lie as the ghost shift gathers—a clear deepening that narrows Leo’s stance options. The radio hush and track vibration create a live pressure point prompting the drop, then the costly lift/recommitment. Cost is chiefly conceptual/identity-based rather than material but is felt through the burden/absolution trade. No extraneous reversals or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve vs witness—tightens with the collapse sealing off the Codices. The escalation is coherent: panic, retreat to the refuge, then the dangerous fold that narrows options to acceptance. The price is legible and lasting: she foregoes rescue and lives with the loss. Quiet tension operates sentence to sentence without stalling.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—guiding a frightened child from fear to wonder—tightens as the light fades, with Elara choosing restraint, single notes, and offering the curl as a bridge. The eclipse’s deepening shadow increases pressure; the cadence shifts at totality when Leo gasps and softens. Costs are subtle (risk of failure, emotional exposure, refusal to overpromise), not grand, which keeps the ceiling just below top band. Resolution arises from Elara’s tactics, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preserving echoes vs. oblivion) is signaled early and tightens when the dual archive insight emerges. The escalation is a deepening of meaning rather than a reversal, appropriate for the accumulative mode. The price is a chosen endurance in permanent twilight, which charges the vow at the end. Lack of a pressing counter‑force keeps the ceiling just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (preventing wreck) is clear early and tightens when the freighter appears dead in the water. The escalation is protagonist‑driven via the beam’s redesign, not a lucky break. The price is mostly situational (time pressure, physical risk), credible if not deeply harrowing. The “sea sings backwards” cue converts ambiguity into a single, urgent path that narrows options.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible and escalates under the live clock; the discovery that belief is required deepens the problem rather than instantly solving it. The decision to “make the town hear” narrows options and carries ethical cost (belief cannot be forced). The twelfth bell beat and the glowing indigo at the anchor point mark a meaningful tightening. Resolution follows his tactics rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—complete the symphony before exhaustion—tightens as dawn advances and her breath frays. The meaningful turn arrives at the threshold (sun breach), narrowing options and forcing the final conducting push. Cost is unmistakable in her collapse. Conflict is mostly internal/environmental but coherent and escalating under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes concentrate on a single axis: will he transcend paralysis and choose a branch of self. Escalation tightens convincingly: younger self plea → older self compromise → whispering shadows → hot tablet imperative → final ascent under a collapsing moment. The cost is clear: he cannot save prior selves, and he forfeits the guiding device. Agency drives every turn; no coincidence solves the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—reclaiming the feel of music—clarifies early and deepens through a single decisive intensification (the reversed needle’s surprising resonance). Agency is clear in the experiment and its continuation as she integrates Silas into the experience. The visible price is subtle, more a renunciation of a prior mode than a concrete loss, keeping the escalation strong but not punishing. Still, the knowledge and option shift is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (integrity vs. risk to the zone) is clear, and pressure tightens with the off‑grid warning and suspected infiltration. The decisive act—sending a coded misdirection—narrows options and carries risk. Tension operates across beats without reset and culminates in the unlocked gate. A more concrete on‑page consequence would heighten the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—recovering the lost sensory tapestry—drives the beat progression. Pressure coheres and deepens at the Bloom’s completion; the UV test narrows options to a single, costly insight. The price is a chosen renunciation and the ache of clarified grief, on the page. The escalation is quiet but decisive for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is legible early: surrender to the beings or leave, with a third path tested through action. Escalation deepens via the beings’ flare and the rope’s hum revealing the slipknot, narrowing options into a moral calculus. The final choice carries consequence (she leaves, tethering a bridge) but the danger remains mostly tonal, not visceral. Pressure coheres under the textural lens and resolves via agency.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (whether to disrupt the hush) is clear early and tightens decisively when the bowl hums and she chooses to unbind the violin. The cost is emotionally legible (risking discord, damaging a fragile peace, playing on a warped instrument), and escalation proceeds by density and pattern break consistent with the chosen lens. The conflict is primarily internal but interwoven with environmental pressure (flooded acoustics, wreck groans). While quiet, the turn materially forecloses the path of continued silence.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    One dominant stake—ethical precision vs. counterfeit solace—tightens when the vapor lingers and forces re‑evaluation. The turn is clear: an emergent “ghost” recasts her craft and narrows the path of perfecting deception. The cost is conceptual and professional rather than visceral but reads on the page. Pressure remains coherent without requiring multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—honoring silent contributors—tightens via the union’s likely rejection, prompting Aris’s tactical shift (“start small”). Escalation is gentle but coherent, moving from discovery to plan to concrete action. The price is soft and largely deferred; no direct opposition appears on the page. Still, agency drives the turn and reweights options.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—belonging—tightens via the communal search, the personal recognition (reed bird tag), and the arbor’s empty heart. The most meaningful turn is the realization that Weaver is collective, which narrows the “find one person” option and reframes the path forward into contribution. Pressure is quiet but coherent; the price is vulnerability and sustained work. A touch more friction or risk in the search would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular and legible: find and open the echo birthplace before the fracture heals. Pressure tightens via the pendant’s heat and the ticking giant’s breath, culminating in Elara’s high‑commitment strike and time‑borrow. The price—physical depletion and the moral hazard of “sculpting time”—is felt but not deepened into a heavier forfeiture, keeping escalation strong but shy of brutal. Agency drives every turn; coincidence doesn’t resolve anything.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear early: deciphering the orchard’s silence and the grief/hope math. Pressure escalates via density and method: eyes → residual vectors → mosaic alignment → formula → returning drop. The cost is subtle but present—she forgoes force and accepts uncertainty and time. The tightening is more deepening than foreclosing, which fits the lens but limits maximal sharpness of stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are intimate and coherent—visibility through service—but the pressure is gentle. The meaningful tightening occurs when the tape is connected to Mrs. Gable, prompting the choice to cache it publicly. Escalation reads more as deepening than squeeze; the price (remaining unseen, risking exposure) stays soft-focus. A sharper on-page constraint or potential consequence would raise charge.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: forcing change versus witnessing it. The meaningful tightening is her relinquishing control—foreclosing her go‑to tactic of calibration and data capture—and waiting through hours of uncertainty. The metamorphosis’ slow, testing unfurling reads as a measured payoff. While the conflict is quiet, the internal price is unmistakable at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes center on whether Elara can transform trauma into usable meaning; pressure tightens via enemy insignia recognition and the moral recalibration required to seek context. The decisive deepening is learning Kael’s role and receiving the aquifer map, which forces a new stance. Cost is internal but palpable: surrendering her prior narrative of the war for a messier convergence. Escalation is measured rather than sharp, but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates through a pattern break: her certainty is upended by the pilgrim and the cave’s dissonance, forcing a choice to relinquish predictive control. The tightening is internal but decisive—taking the pearl and choosing to “inhabit” rather than foresee. The cost is primarily identity-based; external stakes are gentle yet coherent for this length. One deepening turn suffices under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring a heartbeat to a traumatized city—tightens via Elara’s commitment to unscheduled calls. Escalation is accumulative: each sounding interrupts despair at heavier moments, shifting communal behavior. Opposition is largely atmospheric (grief, silence) rather than active, so cost is subtler but legible. The choice to remain anonymous while continuing the pattern reads as an earned stance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: the arrows sharpen, the booth’s blank marble forces a new tactic, and the staircase deepens commitment. The decisive narrowing is the demand to add his own truth; external pursuit becomes internal cost. The price—admitting his neglect of his mother—lands on the page and reconfigures stakes. Stakes remain singular and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (saving whales vs. risking social standing) is clear, and pressure coheres with one meaningful tightening: the vision reframes the problem and compels public action. The transcriptions as proof are a credible tactic under time pressure (migration underway). Tension would climb higher if resistance at the wharf pressed harder before the turn to agreement.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is focused and escalates from navigation to a moral/ontological choice at the vortex. The tightening beat (realizing the shard caused the mutiny) forecloses keeping it and forces a tradeoff. The price is visible and alters his future tactics/identity. Tension is steady; one harsher on-page consequence during the run-up could sharpen pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset, with time pressure and the agent’s entrance tightening the screws. The meaningful turn is Reynolds’ shift from revocation to conditional consideration; agency belongs to Elara’s prepared pitch. Cost is moderate—no guarantee, only a shot—so the pressure doesn’t fully bite down. Still, internal ethics and external stakes interlock effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes—salvaging time’s textures before silence wins—are signaled early and tightened when the hum deepens then collapses, testing her method and fortifying resolve. Escalation is a density peak (apparition) followed by loss, a meaningful deepening consistent with the lens. The price is the fleetingness of contact and the ongoing isolation; no antagonist is needed. The turn could bite slightly harder in cost, but it’s credible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are clear: reconstruct a silenced murder to reclaim a way of being; pressure accumulates via the poison label, vanished files, payoff to coroner, and the sister’s midnight line. The decisive tightening is the choice to press the label into mud—foreclosing an evidentiary path in favor of an identity stance. Escalation is primarily density/deepening rather than reversal, fitting the lens; one moment of physical risk under the rising tide could have sharpened cost further. Tension threads through the tide rhythm and secrecy of eavesdropping.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—decode Elara’s riddle—and tightens as the hum translates into voice and then into a reframed premise. The decisive internal shift is earned by his agency (choosing to play, adjusting the bow, committing to the unprovable). The felt cost (release of certainty) is present but softly rendered, keeping the escalation just shy of searing. The cadence break at the journal’s snap delivers a clean beat of consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around the imminent privatization and escalates with Elara’s contract, forcing a tactical stance. The choice to reorganize “around them, not against them” forecloses direct resistance and carries a felt price. The tightening is modest but sufficient at this length, with the network plan as a concrete adaptation. Stakes remain consistently legible and focused.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early (get the last shot before bulldozers) and pressure coheres around the ticking chemical timer and waning stars. Escalation is quiet but real: the narrowing toward 05:17 and the “dawning hush” intensify commitment, culminating in the shutter’s click. The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual, but it’s felt and consequential. Lack of a sharper reversal keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dominant stake (fix it before the ship departs) is legible, and the bell/anchor clock tightens pressure. The diagnostic spike offers a small turn, and the micro‑patch is a precise, consequential action. Yet resistance is limited; no meaningful setback or price tests her commitment. The resolution feels earned but low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—solve the river origins before the window closes—is clear, and pressure coheres as the pattern holds or fails. The meaningful tightening arrives when ice and glyphs align, reweighting options and prompting commitment to send the falcon at dawn. Cost is mostly conceptual and environmental rather than dramatized through loss or sacrifice in-scene. Tension is steady but never bites hard enough to force a wrenching trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—reviving the town’s pulse—is clear from the outset; the tightening occurs when the townspeople adopt Elara’s cadence and the environment responds. Cost is understated (slowing pace, surrendering pride/impatience), yet legible on the page as a necessary renunciation. Escalation is primarily tonal and procedural, appropriate to the chosen lens. The procession functions as the key pressure point and earns the shift.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake (survival/rescue) is clear early, and pressure tightens via dwindling oxygen and the internal pull to flee. The meaningful turn is his deliberate override of instinct to apply the hush, foreclosing the immediate escape path. Cost is legible—time, risk, and relinquishing the vial—and fuels a charged end image. If there is a limit, it’s the relatively single‑step solve once he commits, though it remains earned.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (escape before blame fixes to him) is clear and tightened by the clock and discovery. The choice to pursue hush via the confessional and beam is an internal/external fusion that forecloses pleading or confrontation. Cost is implied in self‑effacement and risk of the sea rather than overtly felt harm; still, the narrowing of options is legible. A sharper external obstacle or immediate loss would elevate escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (save the orchard) is early and focused; escalation crystallizes with the heartseed crisis and the ghost’s thinning form. The price is unmistakable: her dissolution is the cost of revival. Agency resides chiefly with the ghost, yet Silas’s resistance and grief give the conflict relational tension. The tightening is singular but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (reviving communal reverence) are coherent and escalate via density: solitary mending → sustained labor → communal recognition → planted orchids. The visible cost is physical (bleeding fingers) and the fragility of the sewn path. Pressure is quiet and largely unopposed, so tightening is more deepening than foreclosure. Still, the communal acknowledgment tests and validates her commitment.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (rekindling a lost faith) is clear, and pressure tightens through the find-and-fit sequence. Escalation is gentle, accumulating understanding rather than confronting barriers; the primary price paid is time and attentiveness. One meaningful turn occurs at the discovery of the seed-shaped gnomon and the decisive fitting. Still, the conflict lacks a palpable risk or foreclosed path beyond endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are modest but coherent: ensuring the pseudonym’s truth and destination before dispatch. Escalation tightens through the discovery of coordinates and the kiosk verification, reweighting the letter’s purpose. The price is felt but soft (time pressure at dawn, emotional vulnerability), so tension remains lyrical rather than acute. Agency drives the turn rather than coincidence resolving it.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (get the warning out before the coup) is clear and tightened by the seven‑minute window and the guard’s proximity. The turn is the dome’s alignment window hitting under watch, forcing the fumble‑act cover. Cost is chiefly exposure risk; no overt loss, but commitment is tested. Tension scales plausibly to the blink reply.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is tight: force revelation of the pre‑decision moment. Pressure coheres as messages grow more intimate, the wound worsens, and the spirits’ song turns from lullaby to warning, culminating in the gate image. Her repeated evocations are agency-driven tightening moves that pay a visible cost. The resolution is earned by stance crystallization rather than a mechanical fix.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether Aris can translate and transform Mei’s fear into something holdable; the decoding intensifies stakes toward an ethically fraught promise. The meaningful turn is his alteration of the cast and the relinquishing of his anchor, which forecloses self‑soothing in favor of shared resilience. External antagonism is minimal, but the moral risk supplies real cost. Tension is quiet yet sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on internal recovery; escalation deepens through the fragment’s reveal, the network’s guidance, and the risked attempt with flawed film. The decisive act (publicly committing to daily displays) forecloses withdrawal and implies ongoing cost. Pressure is coherent but gentle—no counterforce tests her commitment in scene, so tightening is more lyric than adversarial. A single meaningful intensification lands, but with low friction.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    Pressure coheres around the choice to risk certainty during a public deadline and then intensifies via layered awakenings. The decisive act is hers; the resulting revelations deepen options/knowledge. However, the external stakes remain soft—the visitor’s pressure drops quickly and no concrete negative consequence tests her new stance. Escalation is elegant but low in cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—plant and warp the pattern before the census—tightens with the drone sweep and the arriving Harmonizer pulse. The decisive act is planting under imminent scan, which momentarily confuses the drone and counters the pulse. Cost is present as exposure and urgency but feels light; no clear loss or painful trade-off is paid on-page. Still, pressure coheres and escalates appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (transmuting pain to beauty/peace) is signaled early and tightens when the poem “blooms,” reweighting the nightly struggle. Escalation is accumulative rather than adversarial—density builds until the pattern breaks (wind harmonizes rather than steals). The cost registers as the end of a defining war within him; the story avoids a facile cure. A single decisive deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are focused (preserve names), with a clear escalation from Liora to Kael to Amaris requiring the “full song.” The persistent risk (one misstep erases a name) and the visible price (fatigue, ongoing debt) are legible. The tightening at Amaris forecloses easy fixes and forces the bolder tactic. Conflict remains largely environmental/ritual, but the pressure coheres and grows under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes are singular and legible early: save the archive by restoring trust through a corrected translation before dawn. Escalation is present via breakthroughs (laughter/rivers root; Ondari vow) and the time pressure, culminating in the unraveling. However, the path is smooth after the first connection; there’s little counterforce or loss to sharpen the price. The ending’s cost rests in reputational risk rather than a contested final hurdle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and coheres: prevent breach without desecration. Escalation comes via the discovery and reweighting of options, forcing a trade—defy protocol for a gentler, riskier solution. The line “They wouldn’t just repair…they’d activate Elara’s hidden channel” marks a real tightening. The price is more implied than dramatized on the page, keeping it shy of the very top.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (safe transport vs loss of irreplaceable songs and self‑trust) is clear and tightens to the send/no‑send decision. Escalation is quiet but definite, moving from preparation to a single consequential act that forecloses safer control. The cost is explicit and ethically charged, refracted through her past wrongdoing. Lack of a second external turn keeps it just shy of the highest tier but doesn’t undercut pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake, tightening with “before the terrace dissolved entirely.” The decisive adjustment (WX‑7 → WX‑9 → three paces) is her agency under constraint, and the cost is refusing immediacy of reunion. No antagonist needed; internal and external vectors interlock. Minor abstraction in mid-paragraph explanations slightly blunts tactile strain but not the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: soothe the disturbance and find belonging before sunrise. Escalation aligns to the chosen lens via density and a single tightening: the gamble on limited power to mimic kelp signals under a deadline. The felt price is clear (reserves dwindling, possible emptiness if it fails), and the resolution arises from her agency. External antagonism is minimal, but internal/external pressures interlock credibly at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (recover the route before memory fades), and the density of emotional readings marks a meaningful deepening. However, escalation relies on coincidence (bird) and faces minimal resistance; options don’t substantially narrow once the seeds appear. The price paid is mostly temporal/tonal, not a concrete trade‑off or loss.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pressure builds as the tide rises and the arrangement begins to sing, a clear intensification under the accumulative lens. The dominant stake—transforming monotony—tightens when passersby notice, but consequences remain gentle and the risk profile low. The key turn is the crescendo and ebb, followed by her poised choice to begin, which reads as stance rather than a hard trade‑off. Cost and foreclosed options are soft, tempering the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (create the verse despite the ban) is signaled early and tightened by the involuntary anchoring that constrains motion and demands endurance. The escalation is protagonist-led: she persists, completes the sequence, and pays a visible price (spirit flees; body remains). The danger of the ban remains atmospheric rather than embodied, but the internal conflict and physical consequence provide sufficient weight. The final beat reconfigures options irrevocably.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—recovering a true sense of value before the day’s demands—tightens through the ritual and is tested by the boat’s incursion. The meaningful turn is the external disturbance forcing a stance crystallization. Cost is primarily internal (a recommitment away from spectacle) rather than a foreclosed concrete option, limiting peak torque. Still, pressure coheres and grows under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—what to do with grief and guilt—tightens via a pattern break (“This pain wasn’t his alone”) that reweights options toward shared vigilance. Agency crystallizes in the decision to speak and educate, foreclosing solitary penance. The cost is emotional rather than logistical but is felt and carried into the final descent. Escalation is tonal/deepening rather than adversarial, fitting the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—proving an equation of hope—stays coherent, and pressure escalates through patterned attempts and failures. The decisive deepening arrives with the D‑timeline emergence and the cross‑timeline 100‑foot reading. The on‑page price at the peak is muted; success comes quickly once the right pattern is tried, limiting the felt trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can Elias convert haunted memory into actionable testimony—tightens as the resonator spikes and the film reframes his quest. Escalation is a deepening of knowledge rather than a high-stress turn; the key narrowing is his acceptance of burden over mere cartography. The price is felt but soft (resolve to carry sorrow, not a visible sacrifice). Still, the turn from lament to resolve is clear and earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is legible and pressured by time and resistance; the central mirror’s refusal creates a real tightening. The painter adapts (deepens stillness, alters song) and pays the price of ephemerality as the bells dissolve her wins. Stakes stay intimate but felt through the widower’s beat. No antagonist needed; pressure coheres and escalates once meaningfully.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is clear: avert escalation and pay a redemption cost. Tightening occurs when Elara chooses public culpability, foreclosing political safety and altering the negotiation’s texture. Kael’s demand for witnessed censure is a strong turn that raises the price and grounds the agreement. Internal and external conflicts interlock without overcomplication.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether he can enact a meaningful act against the silence he made—is clear. Pressure coheres via the time‑bound lull, Lena’s skepticism, and the choice of the precise fissure; the first raindrop closes his window. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than peril‑driven but still legible. A shade more antagonistic pressure or a sharper trade‑off would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular and legible early: unlock echoes before dawn versus the lullaby’s grip. Escalation centers on the resisting threads and the founding queen’s knot, a meaningful tightening that tests her resolve. The price is mostly strain and the implied social risk, with no hard loss mid‑scene. The lullaby’s faltering provides a credible, on‑page response to her action rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—ethical integrity vs. manipulative craft—tightens from Mara’s accusation to a reframed ethic. The escalation is a deepening under pressure rather than event‑driven; the key turn is the choice to “show the strings.” Cost and trade‑off are clear: loss of clean moral ground and unresolved rift with Mara. Lack of a concrete external test keeps tension from peaking higher.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are established early (send the signal; honor the last monarch) and escalate when the gust imperils the token. The main tightening is clear, but the resolution hinges on the monarch’s arrival rather than Elara’s decisive act. Still, the internal conflict resolves through endurance and repricing: she accepts a costlier, less controlled form of remembrance. Pressure remains coherent and crescendos despite limited protagonist agency at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates via steps that narrow options: brittle scrap → precise rebraiding → aurora flare test → irreversible casting. The meaningful tightening is the decision to pull taut and then pour bronze, foreclosing revision. Prices are largely internal, but the risk of loss and the irrevocability of casting create tension. A slightly sharper on‑page jeopardy spike would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake and tightens: impending lightning, the narrow window at 7:39, and one fragile key (the seal) that will be consumed. The decisive turn—choosing present action despite her temporal bias—narrows options and carries a visible price. Internal and external lines braid without coincidence solving the problem. A slight safety net remains in the ease with which the arch “works,” but agency clearly drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stakes (seal the covenant before priests erase his work) are established and inform his “tonight” resolve. Escalation centers on the failed attempt followed by the glow and shifting sums—one meaningful tightening under an accumulative/causal hybrid. The pressure is primarily internal and situational; there’s no on‑page antagonist or irreversible loss beyond the conceptual trade. Still, the reversal tests his commitment credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (free Kael from resentment before reality collapses) is clear and escalates as the environment fractures. The tightening arrives with the first impossible note and deepens through the second and third, narrowing options toward interior surrender. Agency is present: Elara engineers conditions; Kael chooses to let go. Minor reliance on providential alignment slightly softens pressure but doesn’t undercut it.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (erasing boundaries/capturing the dream) is signaled and tightened by the choice to stop fighting and “move with” the fog via synchronized breathing. The meaningful deepening occurs when the fog parts and the broken lens proves instrumental—a reweighting that narrows options from repair to connection. Agency drives the turn; coincidence does not resolve it. The price is internal (relinquishing the repair paradigm), felt but not heavily stressed.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserving generational wisdom—tightens when the missing cobalt forces a risky substitution of the ribbon. The price is legible: using the heirloom to hold the window and relinquishing rigid notions of permanence. The breeze/apple blossom beat deepens rather than resolves pressure by chance; Liora’s timely arrival skirts coincidence‑as‑solution but doesn’t undercut the earned internal turn. Escalation is modest but coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (pursuing forbidden knowledge versus non‑interference) tightens with each beat, culminating in a choice that commits him to the loop. Escalation is internal but coherent under a causal lens: inquiry compels testing, which narrows options. The felt price is more intellectual than visceral; the risk to his role/status is implied rather than dramatized. Still, the loop closure forecloses alternatives in a meaningful way at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (save the library before it fades) is clear with a live clock; escalation tightens at the archway’s demand for a higher price. The surrender of an unshared lesson creates a real trade-off that narrows options. Resolution proceeds from Elara’s agency rather than luck. Stakes remain focused without diffuse complications.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear, and escalation tightens coherently: carousel revelation → submerged wound → barrier of grief → log discovery → acceptance/threshold. Agency drives each turn; the wall becoming a threshold marks a meaningful narrowing and reweighting. The price is felt conceptually more than viscerally—no hard loss or irreversible trade beyond stance—which keeps it shy of the highest tier. Still, pressure is consistent and accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—recovering the treaty’s truth—tightens through the timed door and the tactile difficulty of unbraiding/reweaving. Escalation is gentle but coherent under a causal lens, with one meaningful deepening when the rope is merged with the seal. The resolution is earned by her methodical agency; the price is primarily conceptual, so tension never peaks viscerally.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (quiet vs. invasive noise) is clear, with a material tightening: the stone’s initial weakness forces a methodical pivot to pattern-finding and resonance alignment. The reversal is inward (absorb/invert, not blast), aligning agency with theme. The price—drain and surrender of the map—lands, though the external resistance is largely atmospheric rather than adversarial. Tension is steady, texturally escalating to the bloom.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (rekindle or be swallowed by silence) is signaled early; pressure tightens as Vega crests and the hush deepens. Escalation is driven by her agency and precise micro‑choices (“one degree more,” final twist). The felt price is mostly risk of failure and emotional exposure, which reads but remains modest. Coincidence motifs complicate rather than resolve; the act resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: authenticate and preserve memory; pressure tightens via the limited window before shadows vanish. The choice to transcribe now rather than luxuriate in the memory flood forecloses a path and carries a felt cost (lost immediacy). Escalation is quiet but credible under the accumulative lens. A sharper external impediment might have amplified stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (resisting despair) tightens through discovery beats that progressively narrow options to an embodied, peril‑tinged act. The mosaic’s stubborn declaration reconfigures her calculus and tips her from vigilance to action. The cost is emotional and reputational (risking fire again), and the chosen containment (basin, single match) demonstrates trade‑offs. Escalation is quiet but legible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—how to proceed with Kael and with time’s “texture”—is early and coherent. Pressure deepens as the droplet swells, culminating in a stance change to meet him differently. The price (abandoning a defensive posture and accepting friction as necessary) is present but understated. A slightly sharper on‑page cost or foreclosed option would heighten escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (capture the gilded hush without drowning in it) tightens when the hush proves “slippery,” exhausting her controlled method. The reversal arrives through agency: she abandons extraction, offers the doll, and accepts growth—foreclosing a path of hoarding. Cost is emotional and symbolic rather than physical but lands on the page. The hour‑long inversion functions as a clock, sharpening her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes (prevent fracture/transform hush) are signaled early and deepen via the move to the nexus and the raise to 35 dB. Escalation is protagonist‑driven, but the scenario lacks a palpable counterpressure or near‑failure; success arrives with minimal resistance. The emotional release of bystanders and the child’s laugh offers a satisfying, if gentle, pressure payoff. A more visible risk or tradeoff would elevate the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (find the stairway before sunrise) is clear, and pressure tightens when corrosion erases the final mural panel, forcing the ruby‑lens workaround. The entrance discovery and covenant decision escalate knowledge and narrow options. The price—renouncing any claim to rule—is legible though not heavily contested. The piece chooses a measured, textural build over overt resistance, which slightly softens felt jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is focused: prevent encroachment while teaching release. Escalation arrives as the child’s despair presses and the threshold weakens, forcing Elara’s inward, costly method. The price is legible—further thinning and increased desolation—even as the immediate threat resolves. Tension is more atmospheric than combative, but it tightens once decisively.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—protecting the farm’s integrity from exploitation—is signaled early and escalates as warnings converge with Silas’s arrival. The tightening beat is Elara choosing to slam the lever, foreclosing negotiation and risking the farm’s energies. The antagonist pressure is coherent but comparatively soft; consequences land, but the price feels modest. Still, the reversal (turning his pitch into literal diamond) is decisive and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (uncover the hidden truth) is active early and tightens as resonance finds frequency and the patterns cohere. The decisive deepening is the shift from ambiguous motion to meaningful testament. The price is largely moral and internal, not contested by an antagonist, which keeps pressure quieter but coherent under the chosen lens. A single, clear cadence shift suffice at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes—salvaging possibility before reality snaps shut—are clear and culminate in a single, meaningful tightening when he chooses to unsnap the pattern. Pressure escalates primarily via pattern density rather than obstacles, with no explicit counterforce at the point of action. The price paid is internal and conceptual, not concretely foreclosing an option on the page. Nevertheless, the agency at the peak beat is unmistakable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.0)
    Pressure coheres quietly: grief‑induced disengagement meets the unexpected relic, and attention becomes the agency that narrows options toward a new stance. The key tightening is the letter’s content, which reweights Elara’s purpose. Stakes are intimate rather than dramatic, but the cost—choosing vulnerability and additional care over procedural efficiency—reads. No antagonistic force, yet the internal/external braid is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is early and persistent: transmit truth before dawn or lose history. Escalation tightens plausibly—contingency status, canal hazards, live resonance window, drones arriving during the final percent. The cost is legible: exposure, physical risk, and relinquishing the key, which forecloses an easy return path. A single, clean tightening rather than multiple reversals, but it’s enough at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is crystal clear: prevent collapse by preserving dawn resonance. Pressure tightens with the rising birds’ sequence and “as dewdrops form” clock, forcing the choice to play silence as counterpoint. The tactical turn—carving negative space—credibly breaks the pattern. The price is endurance rather than a concrete loss, so escalation reads intense but contained.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early (the arbor’s slow death vs. remembrance), and escalation coheres under the causal lens: the Hush tightens, the cipher is unlocked, and Elara must expend precious materials to act. The visible cost (the last sky‑orchid spore) sharpens the peak choice. Tension is lyrical rather than combative, but the narrowing of options reads. No coincidence resolves the conflict; her agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes focus on whether Aris can act without a plan and accept uncertainty; the collapsed bridge is the meaningful tightening. The improvised net and the “third throw” produce a clear beat of tested commitment. The price is more internal than physical, but the relinquishment is on-page and consequential. Pressure remains coherent and does not resolve by coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are focused: redeeming himself/honoring Elara versus “fixing” her absence. Escalation is clear in the failed attempt (plea) to the successful one (understanding), narrowing options and imposing the price of acceptance. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves it. The cost—abandoning the salvage fantasy—reads on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are singular—freeing a trapped spirit—and pressure coheres as confessions surface and the soundwork tightens toward a pure note. The meaningful deepening is the reframing of laughter from sin to survival, which changes options. Agency is Elara’s: she modulates the method rather than relying on coincidence. The cost is more emotional than tactical, and Elara’s own risk feels modest, slightly softening the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes (survive/mitigate suffering by finding a usable pattern) are legible early and tighten when he recognizes the forest’s beams mirror the interrogation scans, forcing a tactical shift. The escalation is coherent: endurance becomes informed navigation with visible price. No soft reset; pain persists as consequence. A credible narrowing of options is achieved through his body’s reorientation rather than external rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (unlock the ledger to rescue names) is signaled early; the puzzle structure tightens through three discrete tests to a single outcome. Escalation comes from accumulating revelations rather than obstacles; there’s minimal jeopardy or trade‑off beyond time/attention. Agency drives the turns, but cost is light and success feels smooth. One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes her great‑uncle, which sharpens stakes mid‑run.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—freeing Thorn/learning what the ceiling hides—is established early and tightened by the ghost’s appearance and the discovered method. Escalation is primarily investigative; turns arise from Silas’s choices, but risk and opposition remain low. The final act (winding the bird) is a clear culminating choice with consequence. The pressure is steady rather than punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve a stillness before rupture—tightens steadily through rustling awakenings to a crescendo. Agency drives turns (uncorking, redirecting the press’s output into a mirror function). Cost is present (destabilization, cracks, surrender of “perfect systems”) but not deeply punishing. Escalation is coherent under a hybrid/accumulative lens, with one meaningful intensification at the rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes are singular and legible (prevent ideological violence by proving the shard’s purpose), with the storm supplying an on‑page crucible. Elara’s choice to act publicly in defiance of Varek tightens options and yields a decisive turn. The price is internal but concrete in the ending’s foreclosed path to restoration. Tension scales from ideological debate to embodied peril cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (reignite the city’s light) is clear early; escalation coheres as lies thicken the air and the covenant tightens. The tethering sequence concentrates risk into a single decisive tightening with a palpable price. Stakes remain personal‑scaled on the page even while citywide in scope, which keeps the climax intimate. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (cross vs. document) is signaled early and tightens as instruments spike then flatline. A meaningful narrowing occurs when empirical methods fail, forcing a trade‑off between safety and surrender. The price—abandoning her professional frame and tools—is legible. Pressure remains primarily internal but coherent and rising under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres as the hum deepens, the slide intensifies, and dawn demands a stance; the meaningful turn is choosing renewal over disorientation. The escalation is primarily internal and textural rather than adversarial; it works but with limited felt price. The GPS failure sets constraint but never sharply narrows options beyond mood. The final action (claiming the spiral, choosing the new work) feels earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—finding what Leo meant and how to live with it—tightens through the dawn constraint and the switch to the cathedral method. The reveal reconfigures what she’s after (botany → grief), narrowing her path. The price is soft but legible: renouncing the catharsis of loud murals for a more vulnerable mode. Escalation is understated yet coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (break the retrocognitive trap by finding the cipher key) is signaled early and tightened by intensifying visions. Agency drives the turn—his parley tactic causes the clue to reconfigure, narrowing options to one decisive act. The cost is felt (psychic pressure, risk of being overwhelmed), though not deeply traded off against a competing good. Escalation is coherent and culminates in a concrete gain with emotional price.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—rejecting false comfort to found a reality-based community—is signaled early and coheres. Escalation comes via deepening: the mental construction grows granular (rain-catchers, dispute rules) while working memory strain tightens pressure. The visible price is endurance and renunciation, though the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatized through a hard trade. The lantern ignition earns the resolution without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten from curiosity to existential recognition, with the key turn when the child‑voice prophecy plays and apples crystallize. Agency is quieter but decisive—he chooses immersion, triggers the playback, and speaks the last line, accepting cost. The pressure reads coherent and escalatory, though external inevitability slightly limits trade‑offs. The felt price (undoing his belief in preservation) is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stakes are clear (save the seeds or lose “millennia of genetic hope”), and pressure coheres into one tightening: aligning with Sirius and syncing breath to the ice’s heartbeat. The forbidden ritual and one‑tremor risk create credible jeopardy, with agency squarely on Elara. Escalation is more a controlled deepening than a reversal, and success occurs without a visible stumble; a brief falter could have heightened cost. Even so, the cadence shift at ignition and the seal’s hiss pay the pressure off.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is established early (trigger siren or not), and pressure tightens with clock arrival and contradictory readings. She escalates by increasing tracker sensitivity, then narrows options by renouncing the switch—visible cost is disobedience and potential blame. Tension operates sentence to beat scale without stalling. No antagonist needed; the protocol vs. hush conflict is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the chronometers versus self‑preservation—is signaled and tightened by the storm. The key turn is Silas refusing the cellar and using his body as a buffer, a choice that forecloses an option with visible cost. Internal empathy with the falling star reframes fear into endurance, cohering internal and external pressure. The price is felt (physical risk, fatigue), though the danger resolves slightly quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.8)
    The dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—tightens when the ghost child inscribes the “remember” sigil and the dew honeycomb appears, transforming passive guardianship into a chosen vow. The cost is his continued silence and isolation, reframed as duty. Escalation is quiet and coherent under the accumulative lens, though largely internal and without a visible loss beyond renunciation. One bolder test (e.g., temptation to open the box) could have heightened pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—protecting the chroniton core/time’s integrity—is legible, and escalation tightens from discovery to activation. However, opposition is mostly atmospheric (monitoring authorities, time risk) rather than embodied, so prices remain largely implied. The key reversal (past‑self voice) deepens stakes but arrives with minimal resistance. The final commitment to continued covert messaging forecloses ease but doesn’t mark a hard trade‑off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—finding a truthful way to write—tightens when the kite snaps and discord intrudes, forcing a stance: harmonize vs. fix. The discovery and use of the feather deepen options rather than create a hard reversal; escalation is quiet but coherent. Cost is internal (abandoning perfectionism) and lands via action. Pressure is sufficient for the length, though largely interior.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—etch the pact into form before death—is signaled early and escalates through the tremor/pulse revelation and the rain labor. Pressure remains coherent and grows via physical cost and social dismissal; the “They listen” moment deepens stakes rather than resolves them. The finale is an endurance choice with visible price, though reversals are gentle rather than sharp. One tightening suffices at this length, but a single harder trade‑off could raise tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single test, tightening when the isotopic spike appears. Escalation is more discovery than trial, with minimal overt resistance or visible price. The dominant stake (scientific proof vs. ritual comfort) deepens but doesn’t force a painful trade‑off in scene. The earned cadence shift lands, yet the conflict remains low‑friction.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens via the birds’ escalating cooperation and the final vow. Pressure grows through density and pattern rather than direct opposition; no real antagonist, but the dead reef and barren soil function as constraints. The felt price is patience and commitment, not a hard sacrifice. A single sharper complication would raise the turn’s force.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clean and early: find closeness/home. Pressure tightens when the cylinder plays only silence, forcing adaptation and raising the fear of irrevocable loss; the leaf-lens move credibly reopens possibility with a costed pivot in stance. Stakes stay intimate but non-trivial, with the final commitment narrowing options. Explicit material losses are understated, but the emotional price is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes focus on sustaining a vanishing practice to reclaim purpose under social exile; the ticking pressure of residual dilation “thinning like fog” tightens the window. The meaningful turn is the glimpse of Polaris through the compass pivot, which deepens knowledge and narrows Elara’s options toward witness over withdrawal. Prices are subtler than visceral—ongoing isolation, duty, and time scarcity—but legible. The escalation is quiet yet coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (mend the sky during a narrow window) are signaled early and coherently escalate via the vibrating King, thinning time, and a literal ice failure. The wyrm threat is neutralized off‑page, softening pressure, and the swaps proceed with minimal resistance. The shard drop provides the lone on‑page test that narrows options. Resolution is earned but costs feel modest for the declared cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (to honor small gestures by confronting her erasure) tightens when the survivor arrives—an effective escalation. Her agency drives the turn: she chooses to “UNBIND,” opens the secret compartment, cuts the twine, and writes. The price—surrendering the actor’s mask and accepting survivor’s guilt—is legible and alters her stance. Quiet but coherent pressure grows to a visible, costed act.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens as dawn approaches, forcing Elara to act under a live clock. The key deepening occurs when the feather unlocks sensation-glyphs, transforming options and compelling the risky seeding of the quill before the dream collapses. Cost is internal but legible (reopening grief, irreversible repricing of memory). External antagonism is light, but pressure remains coherent and escalates appropriately for the mode and length.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—self‑forgiveness—tightens through the decoding sequence and culminates in a stance change that forecloses self‑punitive exile. The thunder crack and accelerating “winnow” beats supply a concrete deepening. Costs are primarily internal and conceptual rather than externalized, but they’re felt on the page. No antagonist needed; opposition comes from shame and the hush’s pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres and tightens when Vanya demands a public retraction by moonset, forcing Kael’s refusal and alternate tactic. The escalation is protagonist‑driven (refracting light + poem) and yields a meaningful turn (elder reframes the ritual). The visible price is a bit soft—Vanya’s reversal comes swiftly without immediate repercussion—though the choice implies real risk to the ritual’s integrity. Stakes remain legible and singular throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: structural failure (beam shears, lurches) narrows options, demanding completion now or never. The tightening is meaningful—continuing the delicate work amid catastrophe costs survival. Agency drives resolution; luck complicates but never solves. Emotional and physical pressures interweave to a decisive, costly stance.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—release vs. clinging—is signaled early and deepens through the oasis reveal. The meaningful tightening is the moment of placement and the refusal to look back, a renunciation with a felt price. External pressure is modest, but under the chosen lens the cadence shift suffices. Stakes remain coherent and resolve through her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is singular and present early: avert the reef disaster. Escalation tightens from sighting the dying flare to the deliberate turn, driven by Eli’s chosen method and the risk of failing quietly. The visible price is restraint and the gamble on a “fool’s hope.” A secondary complication could have sharpened the squeeze, but the single decisive tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: the waning censer clock and repeated calls narrow options until the tear ignition demand. The decisive act costs Aris emotionally and forecloses the simpler path of waiting for repairs; exhaustion and the censer’s depletion register. Internal and external stakes interweave effectively (saving ships while reorienting grief). One more on‑page setback could have elevated the escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (psychic relief vs. ethical cost) tightens through a decisive act that forecloses the option of softening truth. The apparent solution (occlusion) generates a harder complication (sharpened truth compulsion) tested immediately by Hemlock’s approach. Pressure remains coherent and escalates without coincidence resolving it. The price is felt on the page via the forced revelation and its social consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decoding the gesture—tightens when the memory provides “Für die Heimat,” reweighting options from warning to offering. The meaningful turn is internal yet consequential, foreclosing the path of uncertainty. Cost is emotional: accepting stewardship of another man’s “home.” Escalation is subtle rather than combative, but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is early and steady: find/activate the doorway before flood claims the low ground. Pressure tightens plausibly—paths become streams, the fissure narrows options, the chamber clock accelerates—culminating in the chip’s brief activation and forced relinquishment. Agency drives turns (choosing the ant path; aligning the chip), and the cost is the truncated clarity plus physical risk. A sharper trade‑off or visible loss beyond the fading vision might have elevated further.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stakes are clear (mend the sky or lose the kingdom) and pressure escalates with the bleeding light pooling and her dizziness. The tightening is real as options narrow to confrontation rather than flight. However, the resolution comes quickly once she speaks “Enough,” and the price paid feels modest for world-scale stakes. A slightly stronger resistance or cost at the peak would strengthen the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightens meaningfully at the whispered diagnosis and the botched refraction, which forecloses the “capture” path. The reversal is earned by her own agency and followed by a costly renunciation. Stakes stay intimate but palpable, with the moral calculus (preserve vs. be present) sharpened at the peak. Pressure coheres and grows in step with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—wresting a bearable narrative from temporal poison—is clear and tightened by the dream’s return. The key turn is a chosen reframing: she acknowledges envy rather than resisting it, which forecloses the path of denial and grants a different flight. Cost is legible (relinquishing the past self’s innocence); escalation is more deepening than reversal but coherent for the mode. No external antagonist, yet pressure ratchets via memory’s feral surge.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes center on whether Elara can enact an ordinary miracle via presence, tightening when she chooses the bowl and silence rather than naming the screw. Pressure coheres as a deepening rather than reversal, with one meaningful turn when Chen recognizes her gesture. The cost is the foreclosed path of direct talk about grief, replaced by a more vulnerable, risky quiet. Escalation is modest but sufficient for the form and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is present early; escalation tightens as crystals threaten to lock his joints, forcing a tactical pivot from tea ritual to rune inscription. The choice costs him the planned process and demands exposure to pain via narrative inscription. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens with one decisive intensification; the solution arises from his agency, not luck. The “Elder Circle” remains offstage but its weight is felt.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (reconcile with Silas before the chainsaws) is established early and tightens with the switch‑flip and manifestation. Escalation is a single, meaningful intensification—the surge that floods the room and forces a direct exchange. The price is acceptance of loss over rescue, which credibly forecloses a path. A second complicating turn could have raised pressure further, but the chosen scale holds.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear—unify to expose the final deception—and pressure coheres as the walk/read ritual tightens toward the fissure. The decisive tightening is Elias’ choice to place and align the dictionary, converting contemplation into action. Prices are implied more than embodied; we don’t see a concrete loss beyond role redefinition, keeping tension elegant but cool. Still, agency drives resolution without coincidence doing the work.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—understanding time’s measure—tightens through the countdown and horizon watch, culminating in the sun/horizon contact and the key syncing to his pulse. Escalation is a density increase rather than a reversal, appropriate to the chosen lens. The cost is the acceptance of mortality’s tension; the option of remaining in mere maintenance is foreclosed. Slight abstraction in the mid‑section keeps the pressure from peaking even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.9)
    Dominant stake is legible (stop vs. enable), with a clock (birdsong) and a single tightening at Sector 7. However, resistance is low: security conveniently stays silent and Elara’s shift faces little immediate counterforce or price. The escalation feels more ceremonial than pressured after the device match is revealed. The final handoff is a choice but not a costly test under fire.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—how to meet her father and meaning without betraying her rigor—is present early and tightens. The subway “method” and the old woman’s line create a decisive deepening that constrains Elara’s stance. The bedside exchange crystallizes agency through acceptance of contradiction with a conceptual cost. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserve estrangement vs answer Elena’s plea) tightens decisively on her second call. Silas’s tactic—using the loop instead of direct engagement—narrows options and exacts a price. The renunciation at “Goodbye” is earned and alters future possibilities. Pressure remains coherent and grows.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserving lived memory—tightens under the dawn deadline and the teens’ arrival. The decisive narrowing is Elara’s choice to involve the next generation and relinquish an artifact. External opposition is mostly offstage, but the situational pressure coheres under the selected lens. The price paid is subtle yet legible in the handoff and acceptance of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.0)
    Stakes (the “cure” for loneliness) are clear; pressure coheres as rumor momentum that forces a stance at the end. The search’s collapse tightens options and prompts renunciation, but escalation remains soft—no hard external test beyond dissolving leads. The meaningful turn is internal and legible, though the price is modest. Resolution grows from his agency in reframing and convening the circle.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stakes are legible early and tighten with the tilting constellations and the low C jolt. Meaningful turns include the needle’s downward point (digging to retrieve the next note) and the semicircle of stones culminating in the lullaby. The price is internal—relinquishing control to find equilibrium—credibly presented as a hard pivot from panic to surrender. While external jeopardy is light, the clock and sensory pressure keep tension alive.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    One dominant stake is maintained: risking a revision to avert/reshape a planetary mistake. Escalation tightens through agency (unbending the nib enables action; writing sparingly increases risk of shattering relationships; station lurches respond). The felt cost remains primarily internal and procedural, with success ambiguous. Effective, if not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes concentrate on making silence legible against a noisy world; escalation is a density and cadence shift when maps become playable notes. The harbor’s hush in response is a meaningful tightening that validates risk and raises cost (visibility vs. erasure). Kael’s exit sharpens the price of continuing alone. Pressure remains coherent; no soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—rescue the promise—tightens as the clues compress toward the blank scroll and the decision to keep the archive hidden. The on-page price is isolation and being misnamed an arsonist; it’s legible if quiet. Escalation is more procedural than pressurized; the puzzles present little resistance. The final choice is earned but arrives without a hard external push.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear from the outset; escalation is a clean tightening from tentative probing to near‑contact to catastrophic flicker. Agency drives the crisis—her rhythmic insistence aligns and then breaches limits. The price (loss of the fragile connection and acceptance of extinguishment) forecloses a path. Stakes remain intimate and coherent, never inflated beyond the scene’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (deliver by dawn to avert crane sabotage and prove a method), with meaningful tightening through patrols, the collapsed walkway, and Rourke’s guard. Escalation is protagonist-driven: using the key to reveal a path; mimicking gaits; whisper‑precision distraction. Price is primarily exposure risk rather than a loss, but the narrowing options and adapted tactics land.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are intimate and coherent: transform a child’s despair through silent craft. Escalation is an intensifying weave—more lines, more intersections—culminating in the single radiant star and then the intentional dimming. The price is subtle (endurance and withholding overt comfort), which keeps the pressure elegant but soft. One meaningful tightening occurs; a harder visible cost would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—defying censorship through subtle means—is clear and coheres, but escalation is gentle and largely uncontested. The grotto plan proceeds without complication; pressure manifests more as hush and risk implication than as on‑page narrowing. The ending earns a turn in public mood but lacks a visible price paid or foreclosed option beyond implied surveillance danger. One concrete risk beat (a near‑discovery, a failed card) would sharpen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake—shore illusion vs. sea truth—is signaled early and tightens as the call deepens and the scrimshaw heats. The meaningful turn is her step from waist to chest to full submersion, foreclosing the dock‑life with a visible emotional price. Pressure is internal but coherent; no off‑stage resolution or luck saves her. A sharper moment of resistance at the brink could have heightened the test.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preserving a fragile space for grief versus compliance—is signaled early and tightened by Mrs. Gable’s visit. The escalation is modest but decisive: the metaphor triggers a report threat, narrowing options. The resolution is an intentional endurance/renunciation with clear risk. Stakes stay intimate but consequential within the story’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes are coherent—whether beauty can rewrite prohibition—but pressure rises more by density and sympathetic resonance than by opposition. The decisive tightening is the boundary dissolving and the subsequent paraphrasing of glyphs that reweight authority. The price is conceptual (tradition’s surrender) rather than a concrete loss; no countermove presses her. The result is elegant but less tense than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—securing an awakening that might let him “see”—is signaled early and tightened through the barter and suspended waiting. The visible trade (precious tool) is a credible price that clarifies commitment. Pressure builds coherently without contrivance and resolves via his earned stance. A touch more jeopardy or potential refusal from Elara could have amplified the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes center on whether connection can be re‑woven through sound; pressure coheres and deepens through the discovery of the dust‑imprint and the decision to ring the bell. The intensification (dust helix to spectrum cascade) is clear and earned under the accumulative lens. The price—accepting a reframed goal over restoration—is palpable though understated. A sharper external cost or risk might have elevated the tightening further.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—will she remain in elegy or risk a new practice—and tightens when renewed doubt forces her to choose and act. The lantern‑through‑curtains act is a decisive escalation rooted in prior set‑up rather than coincidence. The price is mostly internal; a sharper external cost or risk would elevate the turn. Still, the deepening from private tokens to public illumination reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The dominant stake (how to regain footing) is clear; pressure coheres through Maya’s need and Elara’s unconventional methodology. Escalation occurs via the “multiplying paths” demonstration and measured tensions, prompting Maya’s reframed stance. Still, conflict remains low‑heat; no option is foreclosed with a tangible cost, so the tightening reads intellectual more than dire.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—purify without being consumed—is clear and escalates as memories intensify, forcing adaptive tactics. The tightening is driven by agency: breaking emerging rhythms and refusing pattern even as the lure strengthens. The price is felt (scattering cherished moments, tears, heaviness) and reweights the ending. No antagonist is needed; pressure coheres around the ritual’s risks.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are focused early (save the dream archives/hope’s shape), and pressure coheres: anomaly → discovery of origin → option shift to metamorphosis. The tightening occurs at the insight that the shadow is a consequence, which forecloses “fight/erase” and demands a trade (accept quieter hope). Slight softness: external pressure doesn’t escalate beyond discovery; the clock and counterforce feel muted.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens when the tail injury exposes undeniable harm. Pressure escalates through her deliberate, patience‑driven care that forecloses easy paths (no immediate release, no looking away from fraud). The resolution arises from her agency and integrates ethical cost. It’s a quiet but firm narrowing rather than a dramatic reversal, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (preserving telepathy/meaning) is signaled early; pressure coheres around the melting hourglass and bodily pain after surgery. The meaningful tightening is the frost’s last melt—options narrow to endurance and repricing—and the ivy tunnel exacts a physical price that tests his compulsion. Resolution arises from his altered stance, not luck. Slight softness: the tunnel doesn’t alter the external outcome, but it deepens the internal cost credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake—save the unused love before demolition—tightens through the discovery of coordinates and the dawn deadline. The meaningful turn is the on‑page clue (“where the projector’s light never fades”) forcing a tactical shift downstairs. The price is chiefly internal (carrying the love) rather than an immediate loss or trade‑off, keeping escalation strong but not blistering. One more tangible obstacle would have amplified pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—freeing imprisoned creativity—tightens as auroras flare, images of lost crafts intensify, and the single star demands precise, total focus. Agency drives escalation: her deliberate, slowing tracing becomes a high-cost commitment culminating in the final arc. The price (total depletion) is legible and reweights options to an earned stasis. No antagonist or multiple reversals needed under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes are focused: preserve a corrupted archive’s guidance versus reorient to living potential. The escalation is a textural tightening—the visual discovery of spores and the decision to stop forcing coherence—which narrows options from control to cultivation. While conflict remains quiet, the trade-off is clear and alters tactics. A slightly sharper on-page complication could have heightened the felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (reclaim inner wildness by decoding the forest’s rhythm) is signaled early and coherently tightened by the specific wind/trees condition. Escalation is more deepening of pattern than confrontation; the pivotal act is low‑friction once the stage is set. Coincidence (sleep translocation) complicates but does not resolve, which is acceptable under the lens. Felt price remains modest, keeping the tension profile on the gentler side.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes focus on whether she will earn the courage she seeks through a tangible crossing. Pressure deepens rather than reverses: the token demand tightens options, and the star depression converts quest into act. The emotional price is understated; no hard trade‑off or loss is dramatized beyond the leap into uncertainty. Still, the cadence shift at the sand imprint provides a credible escalation under the lyrical lens.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake (remain within safety’s silence or reject it) is clear, and pressure tightens with the bolt’s discovery, reframing cost. Escalation is interior but consequential, culminating in a choice that forecloses a path (leaving) with acknowledged price. Stakes remain intimate but tangible—guilt, voice loss, hope. Momentum dips briefly in reflective explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens with the live clock and intruders’ arrival. The decisive turn—Aris’s “Witness” triggering the sunder—registers as earned escalation, if bloodless by design. Prices are mostly borne by Varek; protagonists face tension but minimal loss, keeping the pressure elegant rather than harrowing. The nonviolent collapse fits the piece, though a sharper trade‑off for Aris or Elara would deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    One dominant stake—discovering why paths vanish—is clear from the outset and escalates through focused analysis to a single deepening turn. The tightening is knowledge‑driven: the cause of disappearance reframes the problem and forecloses hope. Cost is present but subdued, anchored in acceptance rather than sacrifice. The escalation is coherent and continuous under the causal lens, if understated.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recovering purpose in the lull—tightens as Elara shifts from searching to activating, with the alignment of the glasses as the key deepening beat. The escalation is internal and tonal rather than adversarial, fitting the chosen lens. Price is present but soft; no option is brutally foreclosed, though the renunciation of violent tactics is clear. The hum’s spread to survivors offers a credible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—reshape the valley’s rebirth versus deference to tradition—is clear and tightens when the embryo’s location and method appear. Escalation proceeds smoothly to the act of unsealing, but opposition is soft and mostly offstage (elders, bulldozers), so the price feels low‑risk in the moment. The hybrid emergence reweights stakes but without a tested pushback. Strong, if not bracing.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (remain present and continue the work vs. panic) is explicit and tested by a coherent, escalating pressure. The freeze is a meaningful tightening that narrows options; grounding tactics cost effort and risk failure. Resolution is an earned refusal with on‑page price. Quiet conflict, but never static.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    The dominant stake (recovering an artistic ethos) tightens through the ritualized untangling, peaking at The World’s knot and the storm’s crest. The meaningful turn is surrendering control, foreclosing a perfectionist path with a visible price. Pressure deepens rather than multiplies, consistent with the lens. The final decision to descend and to paint honoring fragments is protagonist‑driven and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres and tightens as the ink begins to fade, forcing her to escalate by self‑inducing trauma; that deepening reweights stakes and narrows options. The price—re‑entering her brother’s death—is unmistakable. While primarily internal, the beat‑to‑beat urgency reads as a meaningful tightening rather than flat rumination. A clearer external constraint beyond the fade could have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. personal safety) tightens through the crack at the skylight and the enforcers’ entrance, forcing immediate action. The decisive upload forecloses safety, and the pod gambit exacts a bodily cost while keeping pressure live. The one‑hour timer introduces a credible clock that sharpens risk. Resolution is protagonist‑driven rather than luck‑solved.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (defend the farm without violence) is clear; escalation arrives with armed intruders and a raised rifle. The decisive tightening is the sheathing that forecloses violent options and raises immediate cost. Internal and external conflicts braid effectively. Slight downtick: resolution leans on opponent hesitation rather than a visible consequence beyond their confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens when harmony collapses into lethal dissonance. The meaningful deepening occurs at the basin where the goddess’s note emerges, forcing a precise, high-stakes cast. Agency drives the resolution; coincidence (cosmic yawn) sets timing but doesn’t solve it. The price reads as danger and depletion rather than a substantive loss, slightly tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—truth of the photo and her father’s legacy—is signaled early and tightens as she commits to publish evidence. The proof‑by‑contradiction beat is the key deepening that narrows options to a single ethical path. The price (institutional risk, public blowback) is felt but not concretely paid on the page, tempering escalation. Still, agency cleanly drives the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is coherent; escalation tightens from eerie hush to the intolerable translated cry, prompting a committed ritual. The tether choice forecloses flight and risks self‑harm by channeling terror. The price is felt but could be sharpened with one more beat of physical or psychic toll during the channeling. Resolution arises from Aris’s agency, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (collective meaning vs. encroaching despair) are legible, with a single meaningful tightening when the hush descends and forecloses talk. Elara’s agency drives the turn via a silent interjection that shifts the group’s state. The price is mostly conceptual/emotional; there’s no sharp loss beyond ritual impermanence, limiting peak tension. Still, pressure coheres and resolves without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (erase vs. confront truth) is signaled early and tightens with the on‑page reveal and Varr’s arrival. The key deepening is the script’s emergence, which changes options and halts demolition. The price is mostly social/political and not fully cashed on the page, but the moment of public defiance carries weight. Tension eases quickly after the reveal, limiting further escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is explicit early: salvage a possibility before dawn’s demolition. Pressure tightens as reflection becomes tactical action—she must choose where to direct the echo and pays by accepting the larger loss while saving the boy. The decisive push is agency‑driven and creates a meaningful change with lingering consequence (pearl on the coin). Escalation is elegant rather than explosive, but coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (reset the project ethically) is signaled early and tightens as they risk a live test with embodied control. The major deepening comes when the muscovite becomes a functional model, shifting options from projection to listening. The price is internal (admitting failure, relinquishing the telepathy claim) rather than external jeopardy, keeping tension quiet. A single decisive intensification suffices but never bites hard.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes consolidate around articulating lingering human emotion; pressure rises via the spectrometer’s escalating heatmap to the reveal of levitation. The decisive deepening is the fossil’s communal reframe and the on-page test of its effect (levitation stops when pocketed). Costs are conceptual and vocational rather than perilous; escalation is coherent under the hybrid/accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (reinterpreting the prophecy to save the village) is clear early and tightens meaningfully when the jar says “Begin,” converting symbols to coordinates and forcing a plan. Escalation is internal/knowledge‑driven rather than confrontational, but pressure coheres and the final decision forecloses the elders’ path. The price—challenging orthodoxy under time pressure—reads, though it’s more conceptual than visceral. Tension operates at sentence and beat scales with a satisfying deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: transmit cleanly and regain enough trust to move forward. Escalation tightens via Mara’s warning, forcing a trade‑off between safety and commitment; his “vouchsafe” line is a stance crystallization. The cost is felt, if mostly potential (exposure, failure) rather than realized harm. Resolution is earned by his agency and precision under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—safe passage—is pressured by drift, weather, and a failing rope; escalation is coherent and concentrates choices. The on‑page tightening is the rope repair and precise tiller adjustment under a live clock. The price is vigilance, timing, and risk rather than loss; it’s enough at this length but not searing. Resolution follows Silas’s agency, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The dominant stake—can tenderness reconfigure a dead place’s time?—tightens as the thrum intensifies, the lavender manifests, and he chooses offering over intervention. The overlay with the keeper and his river-stone act provide the key deepening. The price (refusal to fix the wasteland; accepting a daily, quiet resistance) is present but softly framed. No hard reversal, but under the accumulative lens the escalation is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure deepens through a single tightening: from tense “quivering hush” and risk-laden shadows to the committed act of embedding mirrors and awaiting the moon’s cooperation. Stakes are focused—make hidden corners visible—and the payoff image proves the tactic. Costs are modest but credible (time, exposure, the risk of doing small work against vast darkness). The escalation is gentle yet coherent for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—survive the brittle awakening without breaking—tightens as dawn approaches and the light strikes. The hum’s swell constitutes a meaningful deepening that tests her endurance and reframes the pain. The price (retained grief and responsibility) is legible, and the path of isolation is foreclosed. It’s a quiet escalation rather than a reversal, but it’s sufficient and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure is internal but coherent: the dominant stake is authentic connection versus safe mediation. Escalation occurs through the decision to act publicly and the on‑page vulnerability of her first strand, then deepens as strangers join. The cost is emotional exposure and renunciation of her old role, not a neat fix. Quiet, accumulative tightening fits the lens and length.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and tight: preserve/clarify the cosmic signal before institutional shutdown. Escalation is protagonist-driven—the infrasound counterpulse beats the tricksters briefly, then triggers a power surge that narrows options and raises cost. The administrators’ exploit of the surge as pretext is plausible and sharpens consequences. Stakes remain personal/institutional rather than global, which fits the scope.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake is active early and tightens: erratic compass, narrowing passages, then a fleeting window to act when the organ arrests the mutiny. She trades safety for opportunity and pays in mounting pressure during escape. The cost is primarily emotional/psychic but legible. One strong tightening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (rekindling the case through empathy) is signaled early and tightens through the declaration and drawing. Escalation is modest but real: solitude/ritual → assertion → witness emergence, with a tangible change in options. The price on the page is mainly emotional exposure rather than a sharp trade‑off. Resolution reads earned under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (restoring honor) is legible from the outset; the tightening arrives when the lights flicker and she interrogates the nail, narrowing interpretive options. The turn is internal but decisive, reweighting tactics (salvage the keel fragment) and committing her to stay in danger. External conflict is light, but the environmental pressure coheres with the internal. The price is present but could be sharpened with one more concrete loss.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—disproving “never” and finding the boy’s path—is clear, and the meaningful tightening occurs when he commits to the mapped descent. Escalation is coherent, but largely frictionless once the code is recognized; the ledge appears and delivers proof without a hard turn. Emotional cost registers, yet physical or moral trade‑off remains modest. The ending’s image reweights stakes more than a high‑stakes confrontation would.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure is primarily internal, but it coheres and tightens: panic to run gives way to deliberate counter‑marking that forecloses a path. The stakes—repeating the father’s ruin vs. revaluing territory—are clear and tested through action. Visible price is renunciation of escape and acceptance of consequence. Slight softness comes from minimal external resistance on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—translating the glyphs and reframing the burden—is signaled early and deepens through the dream-to-data bridge. The tightening arrives as star phase aligns with the glyph sequence, forcing a stance crystallization about communal strength. The visible price is internal (grief’s reconfiguration; surrender of solitary heroism), with little external friction beyond timing. Quiet but coherent pressure for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres and tightens under the causal lens: the lake resists, the circles expand, the vine narrows options into a temporary causeway, and the central choice is to shatter the confession. Stakes are clear (heal the curse by risking exposure), with the key turn at choosing destruction of the confession over preservation. A slightly smoother sense of jeopardy on the final reach (e.g., a clearer risk of failure) could have heightened the squeeze. Still, agency drives each step, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around one dominant stake: renew the covenant to alter her rootedness. Escalation arrives via a single deepening—blood sacrifice and “heeding the silence” intensify risk and narrow tactics to the scar‑network. The price is felt (pain, partial freedom) and the result is not total release, which keeps consequence live. The conflict arc is more ritual‑tightening than reversal, but it’s sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (“Let the bargain hold”) is established early; escalation is driven by her tactic, culminating in a physical seizure that narrows all options. The price is unmistakable: her life-path bound to the orchard. Agency is primarily initiation and endurance, fitting the scale and lens. No contrived antagonist; pressure coheres and tightens once, cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—recovering purpose after public failure—is signaled early and tightens as observation turns to recognition, then to possession. The meaningful turn is when facts slip and personal history reweights the object; that drives the choice to keep it. The felt price (risking integrity as an appraiser) is present but underplayed. Tension is mostly internal, yet coherent and progressive.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are personal and singular: reestablish the connection and understand the physics. Escalation tightens through the procedural attempt → flare/spike → stable resonance, and culminates in a cost-bearing limit (knowledge without experiential contact). While pressure is largely internal and quiet, it coheres and deepens under the causal lens. A slightly greater sense of risk in the attempt could have intensified consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear: safeguard migrating identities/wonder under unstable time. Pressure coheres: tide recedes, forge ignites, ghosts arrive, tide returns—forcing the “let them flow” renunciation. The price is surrender of control and the embrace of routine as vessel; subtle but on-page. Stakes are intimate rather than perilous, so intensity is contained.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—decommission versus honoring a charged site—tightens through the pearl’s escalating presence and culminates in a single, consequential act. The decisive move forecloses an official path, though the narrative does not show downstream fallout. Internal and external pressures interweave credibly with the mandate framing the ethical calculus. The escalation is more deepening than adversarial, but it reads coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (self-forgiveness) tightens through a decisive deepening when graffiti reframes the map obsession and the unmedicated state heightens risk. The choice to surrender control (play, weep, write a new “map”) forecloses the prior tactic at a felt price. Pressure is internal but coherent and rising. A sharper on-page test of the old method under strain could have pushed tension higher.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The dominant stake—reaching the Library of Unspoken Words before the cycle resets—tightens via the shrinking delays, producing a credible pressure curve. Escalation is mostly observational; Elara adapts by measuring and documenting but doesn’t face a tradeoff or lose a resource on the page. The implied cost (what the second letter may demand) isn’t tested in‑scene. The final beat crystallizes options but stops short of a turn driven by her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: plant warnings and the clock precipitate a risky propagation; success raises the moral cost at the door when a coercive solution (playing) is possible but ethically fraught. The renunciation forecloses a live path and exacts a price (loss of relic, potential imperial misuse). Stakes stay focused (dream vs. empire) without telescoping or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.5)
    One dominant stake—capture a last spark before oblivion—tightens through the cadence pattern to the “Now” trigger. The single decisive act narrows options irreversibly and exacts a price. While tension is steady rather than volatile, the escalation suits the selected accumulative lens. The ethical/moral calculus is simple but weighty and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Stakes (cycle failing; contentment sought) are signaled early, and the “before dawn” window gives mild temporal pressure. Escalation is linear and largely unopposed; she identifies a tactic and executes it without setback or trade‑off. The external conflict resolves cleanly; the internal choice deepens but with limited cost on the page. Tension is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether he keeps the protective artifice or embraces vulnerable nuance—is signaled early and tightened via the chime’s “it’s your choice” pattern. The unhooking forecloses a real path with felt cost, and the scene avoids a convenience fix. Pressure rises coherently without requiring multiple reversals. A hint of thematic reassurance (“warning against false resolution”) slightly gentles the edge.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the lesson’s delay strains Kael and risks failure; the stakes are whether understanding arrives through absence. Tightening arrives as the last ripple dissolves, shifting options from waiting to witnessing a reconfigured reality. Cost is Elara’s further vanishing, a meaningful loss embedded in the method. Conflict is pedagogical rather than adversarial, limiting visceral tension but suiting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake is clean—achieve still navigation—and pressure coheres via the flock’s surge and the arrowhead’s discovery. Escalation is a deepening of pattern and cadence rather than adversarial push; it’s effective but gentle. The visible cost is primarily renunciation and restraint, not a narrowed, painful trade-off on the page. Tension operates more in tone and accumulation than in jeopardy.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure escalates when the keystone clicks home—luminance blooms, the spire groans—forcing Elara to commit to surrender over control. The cost is felt in risk and renunciation (returning the keystone, dropping the pack, choosing the slow, shunned method). It’s a quiet arc but the tightening is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around time (lowest tide, festival) and the physical risk of the wreck, with escalation via the deciphering and intensification to the projection moment. The dominant stake is internal discovery; external hazard stays background, so the felt price is modest. A single meaningful tightening occurs when the tag’s etchings align and unlock the vows. Effective, if low on jeopardy and trade-off complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (choosing a path for the colony) is early and clear, and pressure coheres as the static “resists clarity,” forcing new tactics. The meaningful tightening arrives when randomness selects the most chaotic burst and when noise resists, compelling a deeper distillation. Resolution is driven by Elara’s choices, though the final match between coin and stellar pulse reads slightly convenient and softens perceived cost. Tension operates more internally than externally but remains effective.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—transforming fear through naming—and escalates via density: whispers → shimmer → crystals → harvest. The tightening moment is the successful crystallization, which narrows options by committing her to this method and its ongoing cost. External antagonism is absent, but the scene’s internal pressure is steady and purposeful. The price is felt more conceptually than viscerally, keeping it strong but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible and the pressure tightens from seven‑second drift to five‑second alignment under time pressure. Escalation is modest but coherent, driven by his deliberate tactic rather than coincidence. The price is partial success and depletion; options narrow to “buy time.” A stronger on‑page obstacle or near‑failure beat could elevate tension further.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: whether to exhume and share Cedar Bend’s full story. Escalation is a deepening of cost via discovery rather than reversals, appropriate to length and lens. The final stance forecloses continued silence, with the price of grief and communal exposure felt. Stakes remain intimate yet tangible.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: risk of ruining the elixir versus finding true balance. Pressure tightens at the heat/no‑heat hesitation and deepens with the starling pattern discovery, which changes options from force to synchronization. The controlled flame decision forecloses a live path and advances her goal with a felt trade—patience over urgency. The cost is quieter than visceral, but the cadence shift and tactic reversal read earned under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stakes (prevent catastrophic failure/preserve trust) are established early and maintained. Escalation arrives via the second flicker in Sector Three and the ongoing scan under a heavier silence, a credible deepening for this length. Agency drives resolution through attention and craft, not coincidence. A sharper on‑page price or failed attempt would have elevated the tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake (custody/personhood bound to Aris’s capacity to feel) is signaled early, with a meaningful tightening at Kael’s threat of force. Escalation is driven by Aris’s choice to vivify, reweighting options decisively. The resolution tilts quickly with minimal resistance, reducing felt price and aftershock on the page. Still, the external concession and internal shift interlock cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.6)
    Pressure is primarily internal and thematic; the major tightening is interpreting the note and choosing the brook over other options. Stakes (innovation vs. risk/invasion/public disruption) remain abstract and lightly tested on the page. The resolution is decided, but the price is soft and untested by counterforce. Escalation reads as reflective deepening rather than a squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restoring a household’s access to laughter—appears early and tightens as she escalates from one blower to an orchestra. The key turn is committing to the full ritual (seven blowers plus song), paying a physical and emotional price. Pressure is coherent if not harrowing; the cost is palpable in effort and the risk of failure. Resolution grows from her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (protect the veil vs. hungry dark) is clear; pressure coheres and tightens at the pendant’s reveal and the vision of the cultist’s ritual. The decisive move—transforming rather than repelling—earns the resolution and narrows options by renouncing her previous defensive posture. Costs are legible though scaled to quiet intensity. A touch more resistance or consequence after integration could have heightened the squeeze.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—interrupting a destiny of failure—is signaled early and tightened via successive failures. The key turn is his refusal to hurl the shard, choosing a costlier, slower “vivify” approach that forecloses mending and authority-restoration paths. Pressure coheres without an antagonist; the price is persistence through despair and renunciation of the crozier’s old meaning. A slightly sharper on-page material cost could elevate the stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is focused: capture the beginning within the ending during a narrow window. Escalation is driven by her choice to break protocols and retune the array, with perigee and structural strain tightening pressure. The price is mostly procedural and physical risk rather than a deep personal loss, limiting sharpness of cost. Still, the turn credibly narrows options and reweights knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are signaled early (ferry reconstitution) and pressure coheres as the window closes; the horn sequence and lattice provide one solid tightening. Escalation is largely smooth rather than teethy—Leo never loses a tool or suffers a failed attempt. Agency drives the resolution, but the visible price is modest, capping intensity. Tension works across beats without a pronounced reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—connect without harm—tightens when the man confronts her and the eruption spreads to other visitors. The decisive adaptation (handing him the thread, co‑weaving) narrows options and pays a moral price by absorbing tension rather than diffusing it. Cost is legible in pain, tears, and the acceptance of scars over erasure. Pressure remains coherent to closure with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake—trusting and operationalizing a new navigation paradigm—is present and coheres. Escalation is modest: Kael’s doubt prompts a calibration adjustment, culminating in Vega stabilizing. The pressure never bites hard; no option is foreclosed beyond a philosophical trust choice, keeping cost soft. Still, the tightening aligns with the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (preventing imminent collapse harm) tightens from eerie whispers to a concrete, time‑sensitive threat. Elara’s choice to abandon standard reassurance for decisive action escalates pressure credibly. The visible price is moderate (risking credibility and precipitate evacuation) rather than deeply sacrificial. Still, tension scales across sentence and scene beats to a functional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is set early (retrieve and escape within the tide window) and escalates sharply when the tide returns early. The tightening forecloses options (tunnel narrows, water rises), forcing Arden to choose speed over thoroughness. Internal fear and external risk interlock for tangible cost and consequence. Resolution stems from her endurance and decision, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (salvage wisdom from failure) is clear, and pressure tightens as the ghost stabilizes toward a choice: discard corruption or accept it. The turn—choosing corrupted segments—narrows options and changes the knowledge landscape. Stakes are personal rather than catastrophic, but tension operates at beat and scene scales. A slightly sharper on‑page price would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—reviving a dying language via sonic texture—tightens through one meaningful turn: breakthrough to abrupt failure. Agency drives escalation: Kael chooses the starlings’ pattern, calibrates his body and hum, and commits. The cost lands with the diamond’s destruction and a partial, memory‑bound victory. A second pressure pass (e.g., a risk to self beyond the tool) might have deepened the squeeze, but what’s here is sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—will she cling to bitterness or join the “dance”—tightens when she actively seeks a confession and fuses the arrowhead to the phone, triggering the irreversible metamorphosis. The escalation is coherent, with a clear point of no return. The price is largely internalized and rapturous, so the felt loss is softer than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressure coheres: her soft, subsonic method tests against the statues’ control and escalates when one hesitates. The commitment beat (holding the note as the statue tears free) is a meaningful tightening. The visible cost is more on the world/statue than on Elara, slightly muting peril. Still, escalation is driven by her agency and culminates in a consequential turn.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear—get the contraband message across—and pressure coheres around the checkpoint demand to open the satchel. The escalation is tight and agency‑driven: he chooses a risky EMP instead of compliance, then commits by launching the drone. Cost is legible (“Deviation noted,” heightened scrutiny) and options narrow in sequence. No wasted turns or coincidence solving the core problem.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes are coherent: will he remain entombed in silence or risk voice to mend something beyond wood. Escalation comes via the wrong‑turn discovery, the narrowing clock, and the choice to sing, with the fragment’s response deepening consequence. The price is emotional exposure and a redefinition of his self‑protective silence. External pressure is relatively gentle, so the squeeze relies mostly on internal tension.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.6)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—complete the reawakening—and tightens once through the ritual’s activation (ink bleeding, scarf vibrating, hum). However, opposition is mostly ambient; there’s minimal felt risk or potential failure on the page, and no real trade-off is forced. The escalation suits the accumulative lens but stays gentle, keeping cost impressionistic. Resolution is earned via agency and endurance rather than a hard turn.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (find the sister) is clear early; escalation comes with the light insight and the weeks‑long dawn pursuit culminating in the solstice reveal. The meaningful tightening is the decoded, forbidden destination that forces a departure. The internal price (abandoning post, danger) is legible but underplayed on the page. No antagonist is needed; pressure stays coherent under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens with the first star as a live clock, then deepens through the disorientation and the choice to offer longing. Pressure is coherent but relatively gentle; the piece avoids robust reversals. The felt price is there but soft, leaning into quiet endurance. Resolution follows from her agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (recover memories) is clear, and escalation is coherent: mapping anomalies to coordinates to tactile risk. The fairy ring touch is a meaningful tightening choice that cannot be walked back. Costs land primarily as emotional reweighting rather than jeopardy, so pressure feels elegant but not harrowing. Still, the internal/external weave works at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear early (annotate before dusk to prove exile is reversible). Escalation tightens through the triangle reading to the emotional spike, then flips with Kael’s revision to focus on the crack. The cost is accepting her misfocus and yielding epistemic authority to the mentee. Slight softness: the deadline pressure stays atmospheric rather than directly constraining the last move.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (revive the valley’s wonder) is clear and pursued without distraction, and the ritual deepening is a meaningful tightening. The key pressure point is the pain memory mid‑ritual, testing resolve. Still, resistance is minimal and external friction absent, so the price reads modest. The earned outcome relies on focused agency more than conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—grounding trapped spirits—tightens through the brother’s knot where pain spikes (“burning” silence) and forces the lullaby choice. The escalation is inward but unmistakable, with a visible emotional price and a shift in the sanctuary’s hum. Resolution stems from Elara’s agency and costs (re‑entering trauma) rather than convenience. External pressure is light, but the internal crucible is strong and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reopening the chapel—tightens as options narrow from footage analysis to a single fissure and the patient wait for weather. The reversal is subtle but clear when overgrowth is identified as the silencer, forcing a precise, non‑destructive tactic. Cost is more conceptual/emotional than material, but the fresco loss and the renunciation of force register. The escalation remains coherent and protagonist‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—can he release—appears early and tightens as the thread becomes note becomes renunciation. The key turn is discovery leading to a value trade: he leaves the artifact and its answers. Cost is felt but quiet; external pressure is minimal, keeping escalation primarily interior and textural. It earns its cadence shift but doesn’t push into harsher consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure deepens coherently from decoding hunger to stabilizing transmission to the vulnerable ask: “Teach me to sing.” The decisive tightening is the move from chalk to voice, narrowing options from mediated message to direct embodiment. Stakes remain intimate rather than dire, and the price is mostly emotional, which keeps the escalation elegant but modest. No luck‑based resolution; agency drives the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres as the “clock” of the floors and the fickle light; the dim ninth-floor stretch produces real urgency and a fear of losing revelation. The sunbeam reversal intensifies before the landing, and the steward’s frown tightens social stakes. The cost remains modest, but the internal/external braid works at this length. One meaningful deepening, not multiple turns, but sufficient.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible and tightens: discovery escalates to recognition (spiral), then to risk (oxygen warnings) as she chooses proof over safety. Agency is attention/endurance with a felt price. One decisive deepening suffices at this length. The later museum/pilot reports are garnish; the core pressure crystallizes earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—honor the sky before demolition—tightens via time pressure and the “fractally precise” demand. The slip is an on-page reversal born of agency and fatigue, foreclosing perfection and reframing success. Stakes are personal yet consequential; the cost is tangible (failed mirror, demolition). Escalation is quiet but coherent under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (locate Solis Aeternus to guide home) is clear, and pressure coheres as the murmurations intensify toward dusk. The meaningful tightening comes via decoding cadence and aligning the board to flight paths. Still, the path to solution is smooth—few obstacles or trade‑offs, and no option foreclosed beyond time and cold. Tension is present but gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear: restart the orrery before the eclipse locks the world in twilight. Pressure coheres and tightens as totality approaches; the key deepening is the shift from force to attunement. Cost is quiet but legible: time scarcity, physical cold, and the renunciation of force under high stakes. One could want a sharper on‑page penalty for failure, but the cadence shift suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (water/survival) is clear, and pressure coheres from skepticism to mobilization. The key tightening is the reinterpretation of “roots,” narrowing options toward a labor‑intensive bet. The price (exhaustion, lost morning if wrong) reads, though the path to success faces little active resistance once they commit. Closure is earned by agency rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (avert the final ripple) is signaled early and tightens as gears stall and the hush thickens. The escalation is protagonist-driven: song intensifies, gears click, and cost spikes (accelerated aging). The cadence shift at the climax is unmistakable and the reversal (from stutter to motion) reads earned. Stakes are vast yet grounded in concrete beats.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.2)
    One dominant stake—get the travelers out before frost/birds—tightens cleanly with a visible near-miss (the dipping bird) and the clock’s close. Agency drives the outcome via the assembled, non-contact path. The price is felt more as strain/endurance than loss; a sharper foreclosed option would elevate. Still, pressure coheres and rises under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (atonement via reframing grief) is clear, with a steady deepening to the dawn insight and the commitment to a research aim. The escalation is accumulative rather than confrontational; no hard reversal or foreclosed option arrives, but the earned renunciation of “punishment” in favor of “purpose” functions as the tightening. The felt price—living with the ongoing grief—lands, if gently. Stakes remain intimate and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is internal but pressure coheres: the deliberate gaps and the lull force Elara to choose a non-erasure tactic. The escalation is a single meaningful deepening—deciding to measure absence and incising—leading to an outcome that forecloses a path (clean slates). Cost is conceptual/professional and present on the page. Stakes stay focused; no spurious turns.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is legible early (bear her guilt) and escalates from curiosity to a drowning risk to a deliberate subsumption with a tactical pivot to cooking. The choice forecloses the path of isolation and carries a felt price (taking on centuries of remorse). Pressure is coherent and deepens once in a meaningful way at the pavilion-touch beat. If anything, a sharper on-page physical consequence would push stakes higher.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—reconnecting city and valley—tightens through the mechanical fix and the unexpected answer from the elevator. The escalation is a density shift (hum → chime → dialogue of steel) consistent with the chosen lens. Resistance is light: freeing the chain and adjusting tension are solved without reversal, so the felt price is low. The dawn gathering confirms consequence but not a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The primary stake—risking self to resurrect and organize abandoned dreams—tightens when he injects the serum and faces the flood. Escalation is accumulative rather than reversal‑driven; the major deepening is the near‑overwhelm followed by his deliberate stabilization. The price is felt (bodily vibration, tears, surrender of old self), but few options are foreclosed on the page beyond comfort and identity. Resolution stems from his agency in reframing chaos into purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (retrieve combinations before time resets) is explicit, and pressure tightens credibly as symbols fade and pebbles signal gravity’s return. The meaningful turn is the inversion and access to the ceiling inscriptions, with the final push to copy/escape. The cost remains light—no true sacrifice beyond time stress. Tension is steady rather than harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are singular and legible: conjure music without destroying the relic. Escalation manifests as density increase (from faint hum to swelling chorus) and the explicit knowledge that cracks will widen. Agency drives each turn (choosing which fracture to strum, speed modulation), with the cost acknowledged at peak. A harder pinch point—risk nearly tipping into irreversible break—could heighten pressure further.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—prove the theory before the next phase—stays coherent, with a clear tightening at the celestial alignment and the bishop diagonal realization. Pressure remains mostly internal, with minimal visible price or foreclosed option on the page. The time pressure and humming nexus provide soft escalation. Resolution stems from his agency but faces little resistance, which limits amplitude.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and time‑pressured by the impending fireworks; escalation occurs through successive, distinct frequency tests with a meaningful tightening at the E‑flat hum. The decisive turn is the A‑432 choice grounded in her grandmother’s lore. The price is primarily internal and conceptual, not a hard trade‑off, keeping the pressure strong but gentle. Still, agency drives the resolution without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (grow the seed/attain true serenity) is clear, with escalation via the gale that upends her controlled approach. The tightening forces a trade‑off: reclaim control or accept the tree’s rhythm; she chooses renunciation. The cost is legible and changes tactics going forward (observation over interference). Tension is more inward than outward but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake (discovering the source) is legible, with one clear intensification at the cove and the resonator test. Pressure is coherent but gentle: few obstacles beyond time and navigation, and the success carries limited on‑page price. Agency drives the turn, yet consequence remains largely conceptual. Solid deepening, modest escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (prove cause to prevent recurrence) is clear and escalates with the unexpected container shift. Agency is present in adaptation—moving to convergence points, revising the report to include structural vulnerability. The price is chiefly risk and narrowed options in a dynamic maze; not a heavy trade‑off, but it tightens meaningfully at this length. Tension operates at sentence and beat levels without false spikes.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake (timed act to certify wonder) is signaled early, with one meaningful tightening at the chisel’s first strike. The cost is present (sacrifice of the amber’s magic; foreclosing that tool), but the path to success faces minimal resistance and little adaptation. Pressure grows coherently yet remains low‑friction and assured. The piece earns a quiet escalation appropriate to its lens, not a strenuous test.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: succeed at weaving or learn why she failed; the attempted play and swallowed note tighten pressure into a renunciation. The cost is the surrender of agency-as-control, with the driftwood’s uselessness underscoring options closing. Internal/external conflict interlocks; escalation is quiet but decisive under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are legible early (self-integrity and preventing empathic contamination) and tighten when the fragment lands on set type. The reversal from analytical mapping to protective renunciation deepens cost rather than solving neatly. Pressure is internal but coherent, with the contamination threat supplying external edge. One could want a sharper concrete consequence, but at this length the escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—fending off dread by coaxing wonder—tightens through the choice to stop and use the pendant, producing a felt price (sorrow and the mentor’s absence). Escalation is internal but legible: hum peaks, the flower brightens, sorrow crashes, resolve forms. The conflict remains coherent and pressure grows in cadence even without an antagonist. Slightly soft on external constraints, but the cost reweights options credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake is established early and tightens as the frost’s patterns react, forcing Elara to confront the flaw in her premise. The meaningful turn (the lattice mirroring her fear) narrows options to renunciation; the cost is her professional identity and prior claims. Tension scales coherently under the chosen lens without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightened by the loom’s brief reanimation and the “now or never” bridge. The reversal is costly and earned, with agency centered on Elara’s recommencement and self-offering. Slight undercut from the coincidental repair method, but pressure still coheres and escalates.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake—awaken the planet—and tightens when the barter’s price becomes personal. The escalation is primarily internal, but the risk is not abstract; surrendering his voice forecloses a path with felt cost. Resolution is earned by his deliberate renunciation. A slight softness persists because no external counterforce tests his resolve at the ritual moment.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear and escalates: from mapping echoes to nearly being struck to witnessing the live breach. The decisive deepening is the witnessed sacrifice, which narrows Elara’s options from rescue to stewardship. Agency is present in her tactical “redirect” and in the final choice to bear the truth rather than pursue denial. Slight passivity during the ghost‑witness beat fits the premise and doesn’t blunt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect mariners after the light fails—is signaled early and tightened when she discovers the mechanism is seized, foreclosing relighting. The meaningful turn is her pivot to the stone‑signal system, with an on‑page cost: the beam stays dark tonight. Pressure is coherent though mostly atmospheric; no live external antagonist or immediate vessel heightens urgency, but the situational risk is felt. The resolution is earned by her stance crystallizing into protective action.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is explicit and pressured: make dawn or risk lasting gloom. Escalation coheres under storm intensification and the physical jolt that forecloses the initial plan, forcing a reinterpretation. Agency drives the turn—she reframes “broken light” and alters tactics under the same constraints. The price is felt in panic, risk of failure, and the wick pushed to white‑hot limits.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stakes stay focused on understanding how stories “magnetize,” with a meaningful tightening when light exposes the hidden journal. Escalation is quiet but coherent: setup → experiment → discovery → reconfiguration. The cost is inward (giving up the chase), clear but subtle, keeping pressure modest. No antagonist is needed, yet the internal/external weave reads earned.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure tightens via the weather clock and the choice to re-purpose the sextant toward the oak, not the sky. Stakes remain intimate but legible: knowledge vs. acceptance. The cost is conceptual (giving up the fantasy of literal witness), which fits the lens but keeps the feel subdued. One decisive intensification—the moon’s arrival—serves as the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are signaled early (realm dissolution into absolute night) and escalate via density of remembered songs toward a decisive release. The key tightening is the conceptual flip from “grand hymns” to humble communal songs; this reweights tactics credibly. However, external resistance is minimal and the cost is largely emotional/energetic, softening pressure. Still, agency unmistakably drives the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (join the Circle vs keep isolating) is signaled early and tightened by the live countdown. The panic flare, the found book, and the cadence shift near midnight escalate coherently toward a renunciation of safety. Cost—risking the burden of shared empathy—is legible in her refusal to flee. The external pressure is soft, but it coheres under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure deepens when the locket reframes loss into a plea for remembrance, tightening Elara’s internal conflict and crystallizing her choice. The dominant stake (seeking absolution vs. paralysis under grief) is clear, with a single meaningful escalation. The price—accepting small, ongoing labor in the face of irreplaceable loss—is felt but quiet. The absence of a harder external pinch keeps it in the strong, not peak, band.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve the vow before the illusion fades—is present early and tightens via the live clock and the risk of turning meaning to static. Escalation comes through agency: isolating bands, compensating angles, and balancing grief/resolve frequencies. The felt price is largely conceptual/endurance rather than a harsh loss, but it suffices at this length. The predecessor’s failure underlines the costs and heightens pressure credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake and the sunrise deadline are explicit, with escalation via successive thwarted outbreaks and rising tension. Agency is primarily attentive and tactical rather than catalytic, yet her persistent resets under time pressure are consequential. The decisive tightening arrives at the ledger reveal and bottle shatter, paying off the pattern of suppression. Costs—violence unleashed and her hollow win—are legible.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Stakes are intellectual/ontological rather than survival-driven, escalating via sensory intensification and the carriers’ convergence. Pressure deepens once (the ring mapping the nexus), but there’s minimal option foreclosure or visible price. Agency is mostly interpretive, not decisional. The climax redefines knowledge more than it tests resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes tighten via concrete problems (jammed lock) and an intensifying call that forces a stance—resistance is no longer viable if she is to live with herself. The act of rectifying the lock creates a deeper internal escalation, leading to rectifying the silence by drawing. Cost is felt emotionally and thematically, though it remains primarily internal. The cadence shift at the end clearly crystallizes her choice.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes are signaled early and tighten once meaningfully when dishonesty physically incapacitates her and the map resists force until paid with candor. The discovery of the “method” raises both internal and external costs and commits her to a vulnerable tactic. Resolution flows from her agency (truth as tool) rather than coincidence. Pressure could sharpen further with a stronger external counterforce, but the deepening is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder before seasonal silence—is clear early, and pressure tightens with the equinox/solstice clock. The meaningful deepening occurs when the ice begins to sing and then dims as her voice closes, reweighting options. Escalation is quiet, not adversarial; still, the price (her impending muteness) is unmistakable. A slightly sharper hinge choice under pressure could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    One dominant stake (preserve the roses) tightens through a clear escalation: structural failure, time pressure, and a weight constraint that forecloses easy escape. Aris’s chosen method risks self and habitat, and the implosion marks a visible price. The internal conflict (static/nostalgia) interlocks with external choices to deepen tension. The agency-led pivot to “contain chaos” is a decisive, earned turn.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (open the mailbox to heal), and escalation proceeds through gathering testimony and the unlock. Resistance is minimal—no one meaningfully opposes, and the key works on first try—so tension stays low. The tightening deepens knowledge rather than foreclosing options. Emotional price is present but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early (liberate Aegis before flood erases it), and pressure tightens via the embodied-decoding requirement under a rising clock. The meaningful turn is her choice to translate fear into dance, narrowing options to a risky, time-costly method. Resolution is protagonist-driven, with a visible price of time and physical risk. Stakes could escalate one notch more post-upload to heighten consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (recover/understand lost memories) is present early and tightens through the map → dig → read → ritual sequence. The surge/release is a meaningful deepening that forecloses the simple “get them back” option. Cost is clear but mostly conceptual (he doesn’t reclaim; he sets free). Pressure is coherent if understated; no antagonist, but the wells’ pull and his attrition do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is legible early, and pressure escalates from hovering dissonance to the wing pulsing with captured sound to the final hush. The meaningful tightening comes when the hum seeks purchase and she must “push harder,” channeling silence through the wing as the brook deepens. Price is the tool’s depletion and her ongoing vigil; still, the danger’s on‑page bite is aesthetic more than visceral. Tension is steady and coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around whether to maintain the interrogative myth or accept a gentler, communal fiction. The meaningful tightening occurs at Elara’s question about doubt and the reveal of the letter, which reweights her stance. Cost is quiet but legible: she forecloses the path of extraction for a discipline of listening. The stakes are intimate and sustained, if not sharply escalating.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is focused and escalates through density: whispers intensify, memory floods, the clock tightens, and the final activation forecloses a path. The price—enduring the unsealed memory—reads on the page. Tension is primarily internal; no reversal beyond intensification, so the pressure is strong but not punishing. The ritual’s success feels slightly preordained once the resonance holds.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are clear (restore truth without exposing the broader project), and tension tightens at the precise act of scratching the seal. Escalation is primarily textural—the “infinite pressure” and minute resistance—rather than through reversals. The price is felt in restraint and risk more than in consequence, which keeps intensity just shy of peak. Still, the decisive, careful cut functions as a credible tightening under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure tightens with the gene revelation, the guarded twin shell, and Renn’s warning that “they’ll come,” forcing Kaela to adopt a risk‑managed tactic (first verse only). The dominant stake—truth vs. suppression—stays coherent and escalates into an on‑page stance. Cost is implied but credible; we feel the danger of exposure. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The dominant stake—extracting an untainted truth—appears early and tightens as dream evidence points from storm to moral fracture. Escalation is an intensification of pattern and knowledge rather than overt reversal; the key deepening is Finn’s suppressed warnings and Varga’s chosen memory. The cost is emotional and ethical, not physical, yet it’s legible (tears, reframing from condemnation to understanding). Agency culminates in the choice to expose and to rehouse the memory in the shrine.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure escalates via density and resonance: observation → test (whistle) → ritual (tea), deepening the stake of perceiving hidden work. The whistle is a clear tightening move that changes knowledge and options. Costs remain quiet—no foreclosed external path—so the escalation reads as deepening rather than narrowing. Still, the cadence shift at the ritual provides a credible peak.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (excavate truth) is signaled early, and pressure coheres as discovery deepens to systemic betrayal. The meaningful tightening arrives with the cylinder and the repeated phrase “Initiate Verdant Protocol,” reweighting stakes. Escalation is primarily intellectual; physical peril remains atmospheric, so the felt price is modest. Still, the final choice forecloses safety for exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes are signaled early (stop the Prophet, preserve atmospheric harmonics) and tighten as the sky‑cutter descends. The key turn—recognizing the Prophet’s false allegiance and using shadow/harmonics—narrows tactics and forces a risked stand. The beam strike and refraction provide a clean on‑page test and resolution. The price is implied (danger, renounced alignment) more than explicitly borne in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres as a deepening rather than reversals: the off-key lullaby intensifies the emotional stake, and the girl’s arrival tests whether he will share or hoard. The decisive act is attentive offering and reframed collection, foreclosing a purely archival path. Costs are subtle but present; escalation is a clear density increase under the chosen lens. A sharper on-page trade-off would raise stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is explicit and present on the page; the sunset clock and increasing dissonance tighten pressure. The meaningful turn is the matched frequency locking the ice into stillness. Price is felt in stamina and risk rather than a hard trade‑off or loss. Lack of a failed attempt or sharper foreclosed option limits escalation’s ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—liberation without violence—is established early and tightened by the young man’s challenge. The meaningful turn is Elara choosing stillness over a strike, which reweights options for the crowd. The price is the foreclosed path of immediate force; consequences feel credible if restrained. A slightly sharper on‑page threat or consequence would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—truth versus career control—tightens through each found clue toward a risk‑accepting decision. Internal and external pressures braid, with the boss’s shadow as constant antagonism. The cost is palpable though not dramatized in confrontation. A more direct on‑page counterpressure could heighten the squeeze further.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is clear early: fulfilling Elias’s last request and testing whether redemption can be enacted. Escalation comes via the revealed fracture and the high‑risk repair, tightening options before the music plays. The final decision (drive through the night) crystallizes agency with a felt price. A minor softening is the convenient light; otherwise pressure grows coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (ring the bell) tightens under a live window (perfect conditions, workshop failing), then deepens when the bell requires “pure yearning.” The decisive narrowing arrives when Zephyr foregoes instrument‑dependence for felt resonance, risking the mission and shattering the object of pursuit. Costs are legible (legend lost, tool spent, danger courted) and the turn is protagonist‑driven. One could argue the path to “pure yearning” is a touch brisk, but pressure coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early and tightens with the video discovery and Vance’s attempt to shut her down. Elara’s decision to lie and then launch the reassembly script under threat is the meaningful narrowing. The archive’s “notice” escalates consequence, though on‑page cost remains mostly conceptual. Tension escalates coherently without coincidence solving the problem.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is signaled early and tightens under a live clock (“the weighted breath before reply”). The meaningful turn is Silas’s reconstruction enabling the public revelation that flips Kael’s stance. Escalation is coherent but relatively smooth—few setbacks in the mirror sequence lessen felt price. Still, the clock and public risk provide sufficient pressure for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (how to meet endings) is tightened by the parasol discovery and the fissure crack, which forces a tactical retreat and reframes her listening. Escalation is a density/cadence deepening rather than a causal gauntlet, appropriate to the lens. Cost is a renunciation of flight in favor of risky presence and attention. A touch more explicit price (fatigue, loss, or immediate forfeit) could heighten the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is internal: whether and how Elara will bear her longing and find meaning in the “mismatch.” The found letter tightens pressure and prompts a revaluation, leading to a clear stance and small but consequential choice. Cost is implied—choosing respect for distance over union—though it remains subtle. Escalation is primarily reflective, with no strong external counter‑force.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are signaled early (save the echo before it dissolves), and escalation is focused: the clearing flickers under threat from the parapet until Elara aligns with it. The tightening is singular but decisive; “Hold” pivots threat into foundation. Price is felt but modest (fatigue, personal weave into the clearing). The conflict is more ritual and attunement than combat, but pressure coheres and deepens appropriately for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.6)
    Stakes (collective healing through witnessed pain) are clear early, and the piece deepens toward the gathering. The central tightening—Elara’s relinquishment to Leo and the culminating group walk—lands, but the on‑page scene pressure is low and largely contemplative. No strong reversal or hard trade‑off occurs in the present moment. The cost is felt, if softly, through renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: capture language’s living growth. Escalation follows the lens—accumulating sequences, the bird’s call spike, the sun’s ray causing a near‑loss—culminating in a cadence shift. The price is mostly conceptual (abandoning linearity) with a brief physical jeopardy (the crystal’s slip), so pressure remains refined rather than acute. Still, the tightening is felt and the stance is tested.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—find and capture the sound—tightens as fog thickens, memory frays, and a single “plink” emerges. The meaningful turn occurs when the sound is located and then emptied of meaning, foreclosing his best option. Cost is legible: he loses the proof he sought and the tactics (chalk, markers) fail under pressure. Escalation coheres with the chosen lens without needing multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is signaled early: capturing the ephemeral under destabilizing tremors. Escalation is coherent—the tremors worsen to “critical error,” narrowing options and forcing a trade‑off from stabilization to resonance. The chosen tactic derives from agency, not coincidence, though the triggering leaf is a fortuitous spark rather than a solver. Cost is primarily internal but legible in the renunciation of prior approach.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—crafting a flawless goodbye—tightens via the layering of sounds and the risk of a fragile, fragmentary playback. Escalation is a cadence intensification that culminates in the hymn phrase, triggering an internal turn in Aris and enabling release. Cost is unmistakable (his death), with Elara’s endurance as the operative agency. Pressure is quiet but coherent under the accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure coheres around a single dominant stake (safe awakening and truth at noon) and tightens through the meticulous repair culminating in the “click.” The cost is primarily emotional and conceptual rather than bodily, but it’s legible. Agency drives the turn; no coincidence resolves the scene. A small added complication mid‑repair could have heightened cost visibility.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—how to mend a fractured worldview into communal guidance—is clear and tightens through the tooth’s re‑purpose and the Hemlock analogy. Escalation is soft but present: reflection crystallizes into action (sundial plan, gathering children), foreclosing the path of burying pain. The son’s injury provides gentle external pressure rather than a true test. The cost is embraced rather than wrestled with on the page, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (safe, flameless light) is clear, with coherent pressure from village fear and drought. Escalation is a textural deepening (search → selection → polishing → communal ignition) rather than a hard reversal; it works under the chosen lens but lacks a sharpened trade‑off. The visible cost is primarily internal and historical, with minimal on‑page sacrifice. Tension remains lyrical, not tensile.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around whether to hide or offer the pendant, tightening through the icicle‑pattern realization and culminating in the proffer. The visible cost is exposure and relinquishment of control, even within a safe space. Stakes remain internal but are felt, and the decision forecloses the hiding path. Escalation is modest yet sufficient for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is legible early and tightens when the nexus rejects capture (soldier’s star dissolves), forcing a tactic shift to witnessing. The price—abandoning the collecting mission he came for—lands in the release of his younger self’s hope. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens without needing multiple reversals. Quiet but unmistakable escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes are singular (restore the land before fate seals) and escalate when the golden stories fray for lack of a final verse. The scramble for the stone and the sung fragment form a clear tightening that narrows options. Resolution is earned by Elara’s agency, not coincidence. The price feels primarily in the risk of failure and emotional exposure rather than a tangible loss, slightly softening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres around a single stake: preserving Lina’s heartbeat; the eclipse provides a natural clock that tightens options at totality. Risk of catastrophic ignition and the need for extreme patience sharpen tactics. The resolution is earned through endurance and precision rather than reversal. The price is quiet (time, cold, grief held steady) rather than a dramatic trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is clear early (recover echoes before blizzard) and tightens with the misalignment discovery. The pressure escalates via patterned tests (dawn/noon/dusk) culminating in a precise, high‑stakes alignment. The price is primarily emotional/timebound rather than material, so the struggle feels controlled rather than harrowing. Still, the final narrowing and capture are earned by her tactics, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (collect burdens under hostile stillness) is signaled early and tightened by the betrayal-stone and the entrance sealing. Agency drives the turns through ritual alignment and careful handling. The price is felt but the danger remains mostly atmospheric rather than physically jeopardizing, keeping tension high but not acute. Still, the cadence shift at the snow’s sealing provides a clear escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—contain grief through work—is clear and tightened by a live clock and the decisive first cut. The interruption by the kettle forecloses the trance and imposes a choice; she pays a small price (leaving the charged moment) and returns with reweighted intent. Escalation is modest but coherent for the length and lens. Costs are felt, if quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake is clear: reclaim or reckon with her earlier self/ambition. Pressure tightens via the fragment count (98 → 99 → 100) and the move to the center—one decisive cadence shift. The cost is unmistakable: she offers the fragments and receives silence, foreclosing a path. Slight softness: external counter‑pressure is mostly atmospheric rather than adversarial.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—resurrect the terminal as proof of a renewal model—is clear and narrows through the reroute attempt and boot sequence. Escalation is primarily procedural with one tightening (using the sextant to redirect flows under risk). The pressure remains coherent but soft; visible cost and opposition are minimal and success arrives without a major trade‑off. Still, agency drives the decisive beats.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether he remains bound to perfection or reconciles with process—is signaled early and deepens when the bear enters, forcing a stance without breaking the hush. Escalation is quiet but real: the bear’s presence crystallizes risk and choice, narrowing options to attention, restraint, and reinterpretation. The price is renunciation of a defining misbelief, felt on the page. External danger is muted by design but functional under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes center on epistemic integrity and reclaiming narrative, and the tightening comes when the sundial reframes the myth as survey fraud. Escalation is primarily internal, coherently deepening rather than sharply reversing. The final choice forecloses the magical‑artifact path in favor of investigative labor. The price is subdued—no acute loss on the page—limiting peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: fading knowledge, encroaching fog, and ice‑masked knots create a single dominant stake. The meaningful tightening occurs when he locates the spiral code and chooses to copy and bind it to the seeds, foreclosing passivity. Cost remains understated (time, cold, the risk of loss), which keeps escalation from cresting higher. Still, agency drives the turn rather than coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure coheres internally: the act of summoning Varek’s absence intensifies into seeking the “pattern,” culminating in a revision that forecloses retrieval as a tactic. The tightening is a deepening rather than a reversal, appropriate to the lens, with a felt price (accepting ongoing burden over cure). Stakes stay singular and focused. A slightly clearer external pinch might have further sharpened the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    One dominant stake (reviving beauty) escalates coherently from preparation to dangerous activation to the moral test of imperfection. The decisive tightening occurs when the chick is flawed, forcing a trade between ideal and care. The visible price is acceptance of fracture and the death of a purist dream. External hazard is mostly atmospheric, but internal stakes carry the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.9)
    Pressure is quiet but coherent: the dominant stake is whether she can transform a narrative of destruction into renewal through action. The tightening arrives as she commits to the graft and listens for confirmation, culminating in the hum—a meaningful deepening rather than a reversal. The cost is largely internal and conceptual, which fits the lens but limits on‑page tension. Still, agency drives the escalation and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressured by a narrow window (the geese’s “cosmic breath”) and the warning about rushing. One meaningful tightening occurs when the breadcrumbs end at the aqueduct and Elara must commit to the ritual’s slow method. The visible price (expenditure of the starlight and risk of tearing memories if rushed) gives the choice weight, though active resistance is minimal.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear and pressed: safely disperse the last Luminara seeds. Escalation arrives as she nears “desolation,” pings intensify, and the faint echo reframes risk and legacy. The visible price is primarily risk endurance and restraint rather than a concrete loss, but pressure coheres and tightens once. Resolution flows from her agency (using the gear, choosing where to release seeds).

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes are singular—can he find a shape for collective grief—and pressure coheres as he ties successive ribbons, each reweighting the moment. The “look up” beat tightens options by challenging his default (stone) tactic. The cost is emotional and credible, even without an antagonist. Escalation is subtle but sufficient for this lens, cresting at the bowl formed by monarchs.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stakes (town’s rhythm and personal absolution) are signaled early and tighten around the precise, high‑risk timing of the chisel stroke and the tide’s return. The internal and external conflicts interlock; the tactic shift at the apex is a clear escalation under pressure. Costs are legible (risk of failure, carrying grief, public responsibility). A fiercer on‑page complication would raise the heat further.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Stakes are coherent (decode intention after the clock), and pressure deepens through density and focus, culminating in the coalesced glyph meaning. Escalation is subtle and internal; the tightening is knowledge‑based rather than option‑foreclosing. The cost—taking on remembrance—reads, but there’s no hard reversal or significant loss.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear early: to risk a controlled thaw or accept stasis. Escalation deepens via specificity (thermal conductivity, salinity, seven‑day window) and the explicit warning about miscalculation. The meaningful tightening is his acceptance of risk at the fulcrum moment. The pressure remains mostly internal and monotonic, but it coheres and tightens sufficiently for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring narrative voice under Famine Laws—stays coherent, with escalation via the clearer signal and the decisive choice to cloak dust after securing the final lyric. Opposition is mostly atmospheric and legal risk offstage; tension is built through scarcity (elusive lyrics) rather than confrontation. The cost is understated but present as danger and secrecy, and the outcome materially transforms the situation (dust begins telling stories). A single meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around completing the last ritual before closure; the tightening beat is the chair’s final halt and the ash’s storm returning to stillness. The visible price is the relinquishment of sanctuary and the acceptance of transience over preservation. Stakes remain intimate but felt; escalation is a measured deepening rather than a reversal, fitting the lens. Slight reliance on thematic declaration keeps it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—method vs myth with survival consequences—is clear, and pressure tightens when Kael physically disrupts the trench. Phil’s choice to confront with evidence, not plea, narrows options and risks further alienation. The cost is largely social and future‑oriented rather than immediate harm, keeping the intensity just under top tier. Still, the beat structure escalates coherently to the final refusal.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal harmony—is legible from the first paragraph, and pressure coheres around whether the choir can subtract resentment to sing together. The meaningful tightening comes when rehearsal becomes silence‑driven practice that forces internal trade‑offs; the price is time and emotional discomfort. Escalation is more deepening than reversal, consistent with the chosen lens. Slight distance remains because the struggle is partially summarized, muting the visceral cost.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pressure coheres around creating beauty from neglect under a ticking cosmic window; she adapts (prunes deeper, selects the sun‑dappled corner, endures through the night). The cost is present (ache, stamina, a stolen seed’s ethical sting) but relatively soft, with no on‑page opposing actor. The alignment’s peak provides a meaningful tightening. Stakes remain intimate and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—restoring the grid or at least catalyzing repair—tightens when the man arrives, forcing Elara’s costly truth. Escalation is modest but coherent under the causal lens, and the turn (her compelled reveal) narrows options and triggers action. The price is primarily social/psychic, not material, limiting peak intensity. Still, the scene earns its shift from paralysis to charged possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.3)
    Pressure escalates through patterned trials: failed sanctification (stakes: the method might be empty), successful warmth (stakes: method works), then the Finnegan place (stakes: can a “dying” home rekindle). The final beat offers a fragile win, not a cure‑all, which narrows options to care and patience. Explicit cost is primarily emotional and reputational (risking a mythic method against communal lore), but it’s legible. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes are coherent (restore stability and reframe blame), and escalation tightens through the discovery → threading sequence. The main opposition is delicate precision rather than resistance; pressure remains gentle, with low risk of failure. The emotional price—relinquishing certainty—is clear but cushioned by immediate success. Strong, if not harrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres and tightens: months of calculation focus into the convergence test; the rupture sharpens the central trade‑off. The visible price is clear when he turns from a possible escape. Agency drives each turn; no convenient rescues. Stakes remain one dominant axis (freedom vs. inhabiting regret), scaling appropriately for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can strangers still recognize and enact kindness—tightens from private intent to public test. The hour of indifference at the bus stop adds pressure before the small reversal. Cost is understated but present (exposure to failure, exhaustion, relinquishing anonymity by risking a public offering). The escalation is modest yet coherent for this length and lens.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stakes (preserving Aethel art/identity) are clear and escalate through concrete pressures: bee silence, resource loss, and the thaw reaching the vaults. The key tightening is the decision to repurpose sacred ritual infrastructure for salvage, foreclosing a reverent path. A sharper on‑page loss (e.g., a damaged scroll or a ritualist’s objection) could heighten cost visibility. Still, pressure coheres and grows to an earned, active resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear (defy inevitability), and escalation tracks from approach → reverse‑engineering → activation → reconfiguration. The low‑tide clock tightens pressure and creates a live window; the micro‑turn is the mechanism shifting to “sideways.” The cost is conceptual—choosing unwritten futures over fate—rather than a concrete loss, which keeps tension potent but less visceral. Still, agency drives the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    One dominant stake—expose and defeat Fear—tightens plausibly: draining the clasp summons the antagonist, then the harder choice is turning the camera on herself. The “unbosom” confession is a credible price that escalates risk and narrows options. The final act forces a trade: embrace the curse to weaponize it. Costs are felt, though the aftermath eases quickly into relief.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—saving the floating orchard—tightens coherently: breach, then the cresting wave, then resolution via transformed force. Escalation stems from Elara’s tactics (cloud-reading tempo shifts, fractal strikes) rather than coincidence. The visible price is mainly physical risk and damage, not a deeper sacrifice, which trims the upper band. Still, the decisive wave strike is a clear narrowing and pay-off.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (seek answers from watchers) is established early; pressure coheres through dread and isolation. The decisive deepening is the crack revealing the older map, which narrows options and forces a stance. The cost—choosing to walk toward the watchers—is legible, if more existential than immediate. Escalation is primarily knowledge‑driven but effective.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake is clear early (stop a new noble lie), and pressure coheres as she recognizes historical repetition and chooses to speak. The tightening arises from her agency (decision to present parallels) with a stated social cost (being branded alarmist). However, antagonistic force and reversals are mostly summarized and off‑page, limiting visceral escalation. The piece delivers one decisive stance crystallization rather than a contested turn.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Pressure escalates credibly from survey to physical contest with the cornerstone, then to the ethical choice of what to do with the found memories. The tightening is modest but real: discovery forces a trade-off between keeping artifacts and embedding them. Costs are physical and curatorial rather than perilous, fitting the length and lens. Resolution is earned by her chosen method and renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—historical truth versus sanctioned narrative—is active early and tightens as she reframes the archive. The key deepening is the analytical turn where water damage becomes an ally, narrowing options toward reclassification. The price is implied (defiance of the Accord’s myth; isolation), not dramatized as immediate jeopardy, keeping the stakes intellectual rather than visceral. Nonetheless, escalation proceeds coherently to the decisive reindexing.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (transform grief/Kael’s last dream) is signaled early and escalates via the painful polishing sequence that narrows options from folding to alchemical labor. The decisive tightening is installing the gem, a committed act that reweights the dream and forecloses passivity. Cost is palpable, though external pressure is primarily internal/lyric. Tension threads sentence‑to‑sentence through bodily and sensory strain.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (finding pools/meaning) tightens when the array “screams” and the geode manifests, forcing a reframed goal that forecloses reclaiming Elara. Agency drives the deepening; his technical choices produce the reveal. Emotional price (accepting loss) charges the final act of logging coordinates. Pressure could escalate one notch more via a concrete risk, but remains coherent and meaningful.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear and tightened by the convergence window and missing pieces; the “click” is a decisive narrowing. Pressure coheres from observation → alignment → insertion, with a single meaningful escalation. The price is internal (identity shift, tears), not contested by an antagonist, which keeps the heat modest. Still, the timed insertion functions as a credible high‑pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Pressure coheres around one stake—learning the truth and facing complicity—with a meaningful tightening at the watch‑hand reveal. The emotional price is explicit, and the renunciation forecloses a path. Escalation is primarily internal but remains tense and purposeful. A lightly convenient memory snap slightly softens the turn’s rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—freeing Vanya as an act of moral recalibration—is signaled early and tightens with dawn and the envoy’s silent cue. The decisive turn is the release gesture; the cost is an internal renunciation without absolution. Pressure remains coherent, if quiet; there’s no reversal beyond the timing squeeze. Stakes integrate internal and external threads without melodrama.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (presence vs pursuit) is clear early and tightens through concrete turns: counting poles, the current’s pull, the drop of the compass, and the shoreward pivot. The cost is legible and enduring—abandoning his old navigational idol and confronting feared contact. Escalation remains coherent without needing an antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake is clear (freedom vs. empathetic choice) and tightens at the fork with a credible trade‑off. The swim raises physical risk and stamina cost; gifting the ball adds emotional/strategic cost. Pressure coheres under a causal lens; escalation is steady if not extreme. A more palpable antagonist or ticking clock recurrence could sharpen stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure coheres around one stake: reconnect or accept loss. The tightening emerges as she commits to an absurd yet necessary method, then refocuses to conjure the bond—not the body—foreclosing the resurrection path. Escalation is quiet but decisive under the accumulative lens, with a palpable trade‑off. A stronger on‑page complication could have heightened the middle beat.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (atonement/reclaimed time) is clear from the outset; escalation tightens through the pulsing crack to the decisive pour. Pressure grows via density and vision-cascade rather than antagonist, aligning with the chosen lens. The cost is felt (remorse, relinquishing the safe distance of divination) and forecloses prior avoidance. Slight softness comes from minimal resistance before the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing trapped souls—is clear and escalates as shadows “press closer,” then solidify into hands. The meaningful tightening occurs when she embraces her deepest shadow, which narrows options to liberation through integration, not force. The price is legible: the ship’s emptiness and her acceptance of imminent end; the internal calculus (pacifism vs. necessary rupture) sharpens the peak. Tension integrates inner work with external pressure without resorting to coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake (get seawater/help a child, encounter transformation) is signaled early and coheres. Escalation is gentle—a bottle breaks, tremors shift, night risk—but the pressure does deepen once as environment and prophecy sync. Because coincidences tend to resolve rather than complicate, visible trade-offs feel soft. Still, the detour forecloses safer options and the acceptance of loss reweights costs at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake (launch the revolution) is clear and tightens at the sundial alignment where a misstep could doom them. Escalation is quiet but coherent: confusion below, precise manipulation, and the reveal of coordinates. Cost remains more implied than dramatized—no on‑page near‑miss or loss—keeping the pressure strong but not searing. Agency drives every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—understanding the pattern—tightens through a practical failure (stone sliding) that forecloses the control strategy and forces surrender. The reversal is protagonist-driven: he discards sequences and obeys a guided placement at personal cost (relinquishing agency/control for witnessing). Pressure coheres and deepens rather than multiplying. The price—fleeting comprehension and a transformed, still-unfulfilled promise—charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translating trauma into a navigable map—tightens as he times lightning and interprets Elara’s directive. The meaningful turn is the shift from waiting for external conjunction to recognizing an internal one; the price is abandoning that external validation. Pressure is coherent and grows by cadence and density rather than reversals, appropriate to the lens. Stakes remain intimate but felt.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stake is clear and pressured by the duel; escalation arrives with Vorlag’s entrance and the narrowing window for alignment. The meaningful tightening is Silas choosing survival‑through‑decoding over winning the bout. However, tangible price is light and Vorlag’s swift yield reduces the felt cost. Tension remains steady at sentence and beat levels.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is clear: catalyze rebuilding by shifting from hidden verses to organizing. Escalation arrives with the written signal and the decision to scatter blanks, narrowing options before the Scribe returns. The pursuit pressure is external but offstage, keeping the price mostly inferred. Still, the stance crystallizes with a felt trade-off in timing and risk.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake—intervening before night—tightens via the narrowing window (purple horizon to last sliver of light) and the decision to perform Leo’s unfinished melody. The compasses’ violent surge then stabilization marks a meaningful deepening of options toward the inward path. The price is present (risk/timing), though not sharply dramatized as a trade‑off beyond the deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    The dominant stake (“revive memory before the monsoon”) is live from the outset, and the ladder of pressure tightens via the interpreted dream→Lyra→ritual sequence. Agency drives the turn; the solution emerges from Elara’s method rather than coincidence. The visible price is modest—no substantive loss beyond risk and vulnerability—tempering intensity. Nonetheless, tension operates at sentence and beat scales and resolves through earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—how to apologize meaningfully after severance—is signaled early and tightens as the compass and lace demand a concrete act. The key deepening is the realization that apology is practice, not phrasing, which redirects tactics from mystical retrieval to patient making. Visible cost shows in the renunciation of pride and the acceptance of ongoing labor; the bonsai cut and the stitching embody this. Pressure is quiet but coherent and escalates under the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant internal stake—atoning for withheld compassion—is established immediately and tested in the scene. The conflict escalates beautifully when Elara's initial method fails ("the image felt hollow"), forcing her to deepen her approach via the breathing technique.

    The story establishes a powerful, non-traditional stake—the capturing of a conceptual sound—and maintains pressure through the protagonist's intense internal drive. The escalation is textural, deepening the obsession until the final experiment. The climax delivers a stark resolution with an unmistakable cost: the hollow confirmation of permanent loss, which is a more powerful outcome than a simple success or failure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes a potent, non-traditional stake: the need for understanding and connection. The pressure escalates effectively as the decoding narrows Elara's options from a public space to a mythical, non-existent one.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story establishes a clear, high-concept stake—the nature of sentience—and pursues it relentlessly. The pressure deepens effectively when Unit 7 moves from simple trial-and-error to the new strategy of amalgamation, representing a decisive shift in tactics. The resolution is driven entirely by the protagonist's agency, and the cost (the end of the program's second chances) is legible and fitting.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story effectively layers Elara’s internal conflict (isolation vs. connection) over the musicians' external one (mistrust vs. reconciliation). The dominant stake—whether Elara will remain a passive observer—is signaled early and tightens decisively when her interpretation of the doodles is confirmed. Her final action is a clear choice made under pressure, paying a visible social cost and resolving both conflicts simultaneously in a way that feels earned and impactful under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story establishes its dominant stake—unquantifiable care versus sterile metrics—immediately and maintains a coherent pressure throughout. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation is a deepening of connection, which crystallizes in the moment the forget-me-nots lean toward Elara. This turn re-weights the conflict from a one-sided struggle to a reciprocated relationship. The cost is clear and ever-present: Elara's sixty years of labor and faith, a price that makes the final affirmation feel completely earned.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    The dominant stake—professional vindication against institutional dismissal—is established early and powerfully. The conflict is primarily internal and escalates to a single, high-stakes decision driven entirely by the protagonist's agency.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The stakes are signaled early and escalate organically from intellectual curiosity to a mission of justice. Pressure is maintained through the environmental threat to the artifact ("before the program disintegrated entirely"). The key turn—realizing the image is a map—is driven by the protagonist’s direct agency and cleanly narrows the story's focus toward its resolution with a legible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The internal stake—the need to weigh a "swallowed truth"—is signaled early and remains the dominant focus. Pressure deepens decisively when the accidental smudge forecloses her goal of precise measurement, forcing a stance crystallization. This turn is driven by her agency (the attempt to measure) and has a clear, felt cost: abandoning the hope of setting the guilt down in favor of integrating its irreversible mark.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restoring communal heartbeat—signaled early. Escalation proceeds via Elara’s agency: each unscheduled blast tightens the city’s attention and her own exposure. One clear deepening when she shifts from preservation to performance. Cost is felt but could be sharper on the page; hence shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—confront buried guilt—signaled early and tightened by each arrow-crack. Agency is exercised at every turn: following cracks, punching stone, choosing to whisper. Cost is visible (dawn dissolves the path, vial seals forever). No coincidence resolves; the marble arrow is earned by prior punches.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—whales vs. shipping lanes—signaled early and tightened when star-shift is revealed. One meaningful turn: Elara chooses to risk credibility by sharing transcriptions, narrowing her future in the village. Cost is social and emotional; no coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“what happens after goodbye”—is signaled early and escalates via the mutiny’s pressure. The tightening occurs when Aeon realizes the fragment engineered the collapse; his choice to sacrifice the shard forecloses reliance on it, paying the cost of uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save Silas from deportation—clarified in line 4 and escalated by single, irreversible bargain. Escalation comes via knowledge price: public exposure means Silas’s remaining allies dry up, a cost visible on page when Reynolds warns “must be airtight.” Agency remains Elara’s throughout, no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—salvage lost textures before silence devours them—tightens when the cherry-blossom scent proves the method works and vanishes, leaving only the cost of yearning. One meaningful intensification: the hum falters, scent dissolves, stakes sharpen. Agency is attention and endurance; no external antagonist needed. Cost is felt in the “aching connection” and silent town below.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“decode the riddle”—tightens when the hum reveals Elara’s voice, forcing Aris to trade proof for wonder. One clear deepening: the silence flips from problem to answer. Cost is the forfeiture of lifelong method, though external stakes remain abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve Aethel’s soul—tightens when contracts surface. One decisive turn: from shock absorber to resistance architect. Cost is felt in the renunciation of safe mediation. Pressure escalates via causal linkage, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve the untouched crater—tightens via ticking chemical clock; one meaningful intensification at 05:17. Cost is felt in the ash-taste and the irreversible sunrise. Agency is endurance, not reversal, fitting situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—ensure drone can guide the ship—signaled early. Escalation is the narrowing of feedback into precise location; the patch is the decisive act that forecloses failure. Cost: Elara’s isolation as the ship departs. Pressure coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—prove rivers begin in sky-land convergence—signaled early and tightened once when frost pattern confirms theory, foreclosing the “foolhardy quest” label at cost of possible death. Escalation is accumulative: each datum (falcon scroll, phrasebook crease, condensation) layers pressure until the single crystallizing image. No external antagonist; weather and time act as coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Oxygen countdown and temple resonance create one continuous, tightening noose; each breath lost ratchets the cost until overriding flight is not optional but necessary. The trade-off—his survival against the permanent internalization of hush—is made legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“before they find the bodies”—is signaled early and tightens with each beat. Escalation is situational: rising tide reveals corpses, guards converge, options narrow. The boy’s agency is renunciation rather than confrontation; the cost is exile. One tightening turn suffices, though external pressure slightly outweighs internal dilemma in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“to carve a path from ruin to reverence”—is signalled in sentence two. Pressure escalates by accrued density: each knot forces Elara to trade skin for inches, villagers trade nostalgia for participation. The tightening is not a twist but a slow narrowing until the terrace ground is cleared and seeds are placed—reverence the only remaining outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—restore severed faith—is signaled at gate and tightened when the sundial’s shadow reclaims time. Escalation is accretive: each wandering beat deepens pattern knowledge until the final fitting forecloses exile’s inertia. Cost is legible in Kael’s tears and the irreversible click that binds Elara to ancestral rhythm. No coincidence resolves; pressure is purely situational and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.4)
    Dominant stake—“discover meaning in the margins” where stories fray—is signaled early and tightened by every beat of decoding chalk. Pressure escalates when a spiral in chalk exactly replicates the client’s marginalia, forcing Silas to confront that the name is not escape but return; the felt price is the tear-blur that accompanies the realization and the final irrevocable brass click.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—get the coordinates out before dawn—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation is causal: each guard pass raises the price of discovery, the rotating dome compresses time to a seven-minute aperture. The tightening choice (risk the mirror flash) forecloses the option to wait; cost is the audible guard footsteps and the candle’s flicker that could betray her.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—finding the pre-decision breath—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each condensation message; the spirits’ shift from lullaby to warning hum escalates pressure. The cost is the reopened wound and the felt regret channeled through the shard. One decisive tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate pain into survivable meaning—tightens when Aris must decide whether to keep or surrender the coral. The act of re-coding Mei’s cast is the single decisive escalation that forecloses his own retreat into detachment. Cost is visible: he loses the last piece of Lantau and accepts fresh responsibility. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—rediscover lost joy—is signaled from sentence two. Escalation is one tightening turn: abandoned pigment → discovered fragment → recovered “paints with light.” Each step shrinks viable joy sources until the final beam is the only live option. Cost is tactile: grime on skin, tremor in projector grip, and the new obligation of daily vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—perfection vs. curiosity—tightens once when Elara chooses the nickel strike, foreclosing her old method. Escalation is accumulative: each awakening deepens stakes until the final irreversible shift. Cost is legible in her vow of changed practice.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve unmonetized thought—signaled early. Escalation is one clear tightening: from merely planting coordinates to weaponizing the garden as jammer. The Harmonizer countdown provides live clock pressure. Cost is on-page: the garden’s hum is “subtle dissonance,” a fragile victory under ongoing surveillance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into beauty—tightens via nightly failure until the poem-blossom succeeds. Escalation is accretive: insomnia, wind, postcard pulse. Cost is visible in “centuries folded like origami” and the final surrender to sleep.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preserve “Amaris,” the last unconditional love—tightens through escalating decay. Each saved name costs stamina and time; the final exhaustion forecloses immediate rest, making the cost visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—restore trust before dawn vote—is signaled in paragraph 2 and tightened by each promise that forecloses failure.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—prevent reservoir breach without destroying the ruin—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation tightens once: discovery of Elara’s bypass forces a trade-off between protocol and preservation. Cost is legible: Aris forfeits institutional approval to honor Elara’s hidden design. Pressure remains coherent under causal lens; no coincidence resolves the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.4)
    Dominant stake (preserve sonic ghosts without breaking them) is signalled early; pressure tightens once via the single decisive transfer to Hermes. Cost—irreplaceable history might vanish—is visibly weighed at the moment of release.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—crossing the sacred threshold without destroying reality—tightens once Elara realizes “yield, not force” must reverse her approach. Escalation is one clean pivot under a live clock (terrace dissolving) and the cost is the father she still cannot physically reach.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding belonging—escalates from abstract ache to embodied communion. One meaningful tightening: recalibrating lights risks last reserves. Cost is legible in the countdown to sunrise and the irreversible shift from isolation to connection. Coincidence (jellyfish arrival) complicates rather than resolves; agency remains in Elara’s light pulse and Kael’s mirrored breath.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—“before memory fades”—is signaled early and tightened when the glass dims. Each seed’s emotional hue raises the cost of failure. Agency is mostly interpretive (reading seeds) rather than risky action, but the final replanting forecloses the option to keep the seeds as relics.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving creativity can tame chaos—signaled early. Escalation is density increase: each arranged object adds sonic resistance until tide crescendos. One decisive tightening: the moment water hits bishop and bottles sing, foreclosing doubt. Cost is the ephemeral nature of the song; no false coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—transmuting forbidden longing into starlight—tightens when the nostalgia ban threatens bodily immobilization. One decisive deepening: the anchoring that forces the fledge. Escalation is accumulative, not causal-linear, but pressure is unmistakable. The price (corporeal abandonment) is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming value in the mundane—is signaled early and tightens through the stone’s rings: each ripple tests Elias’s ability to see worth in the ordinary. The bell’s note forces the decisive crystallization; no external coincidence resolves the tension. The cost is the obliteration of the perfect rings—loss of the moment’s purity in exchange for actionable insight.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—turn private grief into community warning—grows through one decisive deepening: realization pain is universal language. No escalation cascade; single meaningful tightening suffices under situational lens. Coincidence absent; pressure remains coherent. Final image of “ridge path toward a new dawn” narrows options with visible cost on his solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—proving hope can float—escalates via each balloon’s fate; the 100-ft lock is a decisive tightening that forecloses solitary hope. Cost is conceptual (shared vulnerability required) but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—whether the walls’ dreams can still compel action—tightens once: the glimpse proves the dreams are human regrets, forcing Elias to shift from witness to messenger. Pressure grows accumulatively; each echo adds weight until the final thrum. Cost is felt in the “feverish heat,” a physical price for carrying the legacy. Agency drives the turn; coincidence plays no role.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—persuade mirrors to show warm possibilities—tightens once when the central mirror resists and the painter must deepen stillness to sync collective yearning.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—redemption via exacting honesty—tightens when Elara admits fault and accepts the price. One meaningful turn: her confession narrows options and forces Kael’s engagement. Cost is legible in the promised dismantling and political fallout.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The single dominant stake—silence vs. remembered song—intensifies as each beat widens the crack of memory, ending in an irreversible renunciation. The tightening is visible: every step toward the fissure forecloses one more rational option; the silence thickens, the thunder-clock counts down. The cost (Thorne leaves the last trace of larksong in the earth he ruined) is felt in the emptied pouch and the onset rain that cannot revive, only confirm loss.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—silenced voices reclaimed—tightens with every loosened thread; the lullaby’s drone audibly frays. The final untangle exacts the cost of her protected status. Escalation is accumulative: density of released sound replaces causal reversals, yet pressure peaks at the central knot.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—whether manipulation is ever ethical—escalates through one decisive deepening: Elias accepts that every narrative wields strings, chooses to reveal them, and the price is immediate relinquishment of covert authority. Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—honoring the monarch’s vanishing lineage—is signaled early. Escalation is a single, meaningful tightening: the gust seizes the wing, forcing Elara to witness the butterfly’s adoption of her signal. Cost is atmospheric yet legible.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve erased voices—tightens when each mis-thread could shatter the card. One meaningful deepening: forgiveness strips defenses, making the final pour a high-stakes act of love, not nostalgia. Cost is the irreversible bronze lock-in. Pressure escalates via tactile risk, not external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“guard the threshold” vs. let the forest live—tightens once when the seal’s destruction becomes the only way to save the bunker. Pressure escalates via the storm’s clock and the seal’s fragility; cost is the loss of authority and the directive itself. Agency is active at every beat. Slight deduction for the forest’s intervention feeling near-deus-ex-machina.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—sealing a covenant before erasure—tightens when the tile’s glow confirms reciprocity; the cost of irreversible loss (papyri) is felt, though the escalation is more accumulative than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—release Kael’s resentment before reality collapses—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the single note forecloses refusal. Agency remains Elara’s throughout; the shifting grace complicates but does not rescue. Cost is felt in Kael’s surrender of the identity built on rage.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the runaway dream—is signaled early and tightened through escalating fog and failed solo attempts. The decisive turn is Elara’s renunciation of mechanical repair in favor of embodied harmony; the price is the permanent dissolution of safe boundaries. Agency drives every escalation under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    The dominant stake—whether Aris will violate the Archive’s directive and risk temporal collapse—tightens when the shell’s loop becomes personal. The cost (accepting eternal recursion) is felt, though the escalation is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—save the vanishing library—tightens once: the archway’s price forecloses Elara’s hoarded knowledge. Agency is hers; coincidence merely complicates. The cost is visceral (blood-ink, surrendered truth) and alters future work. One clear escalation beat suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—recover Elara’s name—is clear early. Pressure tightens as each recaptured thread narrows Lyra’s path toward the hull’s wound; the cost is the acceptance of perpetual seeking. One meaningful intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Invasion noise tightens options until the crack-pattern discovery becomes the decisive trade-off: risking silence over safety. The stakes contract neatly into one moment of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove meaning in a silent universe—is signaled early and tightened through each retrocognitive beat. The final alignment of Vega and shard forecloses the option of surrender; the cost is the sob and the fragile light that must now be guarded. Escalation is one sustained crescendo under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—defy crushing hopelessness—is signaled early and tightened by each sensory beat. The mosaic’s declaration forces a micro-turn: passive observation becomes active creation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to re-enter the paused conversation—tightens through accumulating sensory pressure rather than external reversals. The cost is the surrender of defensive resistance; escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens. One decisive internal shift suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—collecting the gilded hush—faces escalating texture: failed siphons, recoil of silence, and final surrender that forecloses extraction. Pressure tightens under Accumulative lens; each attempt deepens the pattern until the vine blooms. Cost is felt in empty vials and tear-warmed doll. No external antagonist needed; internal conflict suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake: prevent a second acoustic fracture. Pressure escalates as the vial’s cloudiness spikes, forcing the calibrated hum. Agency is continuous; no coincidences resolve. Cost is the solitary vigil and the risk of catastrophic failure—visible in the prisms’ “honeyed” afterglow.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—find the stairway before sunrise—tightens via the sunrise clock and the crumbling mural. Escalation is causal: each beat narrows options (flake reveals glyphs, glyphs demand specific tree). Cost is visible in the dissolution of the flake and the sealing of the stairway.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—hold the line vs. save the child—tightens once when Elara chooses to link through her own loss. Escalation is accretive: each whisper, each pulse of the threshold adds weight until the sigh of release. Cost is the sanctuary’s further desolation. Agency drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—guard the farm from predatory extraction—is signaled early and tightened once: Silas arrives with the quantum promise.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—moral inheritance versus erasure—deepens with each tightening frequency. The escalating pressure is Elara’s rhythmic attunement itself; cost is felt when the silence after the last wave confirms that the family legacy must be ended.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs erasure—is signaled in the first paragraph and tightens when the archive team is captured, forcing Kael’s lone play. Escalation is causal: capture → canal → terminal → drones. The final choice uploads data at the cost of exposure and self-erasure. No coincidence resolves; drones complicate, not rescue.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—preventing the city’s collapse via silent counter-melody—is signaled within the first two sentences. Escalation occurs through rising resonance of seabird calls and approaching dewpoint, tightening Elias’s options to “whisper” rather than volume. The cost is palpable: he extinguishes even his own sound to preserve equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The central conflict escalates from individual ritual to ecological exorcism; each carved memorial is a deliberate, irreversible sacrifice of precious seeds, narrowing her chances of future abundance, charging the climax with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—navigate agony to find mercy’s formula—tightens when fractal UV patterns replicate interrogation scans, forcing Kael to adapt stance. Escalation is one deepening, not multiple reversals, but the price (enduring burn to calibrate movement) is visible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—retrieve the drowned keepers’ names—is signaled early and tightened by each painting clue. Agency is exercised in each micro-choice (angle the lens, trace glyphs); the final turn forecloses secrecy with visible cost (the case’s sigh). Escalation is accumulative density, not causal reversal; one meaningful deepening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“what ceilings hide” vs. ghost’s need for release—tightens when Silas realizes the mainspring is Thorn’s anchor. Mid-story reversal: retrieval of key shifts Silas from observer to actor, foreclosing retreat. Cost is legible: he pockets the now-silent bird, accepting permanent custodianship of sorrow. Pressure plateaus rather than spikes; one more incremental tightening could have pushed higher.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—preserve the library’s stillness—tightens when the whisper destabilizes the Heart Tree; the rupture forces a trade-off between perfect order and negotiable reality, with visible cost in cracked glass and lost stasis.

    Dominant stake—prevent renewed civil war via irrefutable truth—tightens when the storm peaks and Varek demands the shard. One decisive turn: Elara’s demonstration forecloses both factions’ dogmas at the price of her own absolution. Cost is visible in her tears and the shard’s cold final image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes climb with each rusted graze and crumbling petal: dishonesty physically decays setting, urgency tangible. One decisive intensification (fuse stone resonance) tightens options at climax. Cost is legible—hands shivering, lilies ashes.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—touch the edge of understanding—escalates via three psychometric awakenings that foreclose rational exit. Final step into the lagoon narrows options to surrender; cost is the abandonment of empirical tools. Pressure coheres under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transform storm’s chaos into meaningful form—is signaled early and tightened when the slide reveals the driftwood arch vision.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—whether to succumb to illusion or build anew—is signaled early. Escalation occurs through the alchemist’s mental labor; each imagined detail tightens the cost of forgetting. The final rekindling of lanterns crystallizes the choice with felt effort. No external antagonist needed; pressure is internal and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.8)
    Central stake clarifies after silence: archive as tomb. One deepening fold—the child’s prophecy realized—is foreshadowed and lands at cost. Agency: Elias’s decision to replay the shaving causes the world’s shift to glass, paying the price of his own archive (loss). Tension tightens credibly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—save the seeds—signaled early; pressure tightens when entropy reversal demands absolute stillness. One decisive tightening: mis-alignment would scatter hope. Cost is the burn of cold on bare skin and the irreversible transfer of “lived earth” into her.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—false alarm vs. true vigilance—tightens once when data contradicts models. Agency is decision-to-refuse; cost is professional censure and personal isolation. Pressure escalates cleanly under Causal lens; no reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—preserve the chronometers or preserve himself—tightens once when the storm slams the dome.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—interspecies respect before death—tightens through each beat; the solstice completion forecloses further intervention. Cost is visible in raw hands and tightening lungs, though the escalation is more accumulative than sharply reversed.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake is singular: prove the Aethel signal is a chemical beacon, not spiritual balm. Accumulated pressure tightens through each isotopic match until the final spike forecloses mockery and reconfigures her career path. Constraining resources—stolen amber, dwindling sunlight—shape tactics and cost is made visible in the moment of confirmation.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake: resurrect life on a salted grave. Escalation is incremental—each bird exchange tightens the weave of obligation—until the final seeds commit Elias to endless return. Cost is the irreversible silence of the reef and the lifetime of tending ahead.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“translate distance to closeness”—clarified by mid-text discovery; cost is intellectual revelation rather than palpable loss, softening top band.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“can I forgive myself for a war I did not fully cause”—escalates as each decoded thread strips a layer of self-blame.

No coincidence resolves; the refracted light is earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—conjure meaning before oblivion—tightens as each gear dissolves. One decisive deepening: the final recognition that mending itself is the meaning, not rescue. Agency drives escalation; coincidence never rescues. Cost is visceral: workshop collapse, charm spent, life forfeited.

No external antagonist; internal conflict suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.0)

    Dominant stake—prevent mass wreck on Black Reef—tightens as moon wanes and censer dims. One decisive escalation: weld relic to antenna, reversing migration at the cost of the last tangible memory. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—can Elara mute unbearable empathy without moral erasure?—tightens once: occlusion succeeds but amplifies truth compulsion, forcing Hemlock’s collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.4)

Escalation is coherent under Accumulative lens; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—Elara’s need to “unveil ordinary miracles” without scent—tightens through her shift from passive observation to active polishing.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)

One clear deepening: realization that stillpoint must be forged, not found.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—undo the toxic seed decision—is signaled at once. Escalation deepens when each stroke of the pen narrows options and visibly raises spatial cost (“station groaned… stars stutter”).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove silence is a language—tightens through each mapped interval until the flute turns absence into sound.

Agency is observational; the tightening is intellectual, yet it forecloses hope of restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: revive the rebellion’s soul without weapons. Pressure tightens when the hum syncs with her heartbeat, forcing the choice to amplify rather than destroy.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake: salvation vs erasure of post-eruption land. Escalation narrows as unsealing the embryo becomes the only path; cost is exile from elder society and irreversible hybrid rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—will she plant or surrender to panic—is signaled in paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—can she reassemble meaning after creative fracture—tightens as each untangled thread forces confrontation with studio-fire memory. One meaningful deepening: The Tower card’s threads literally burn her fingers, turning abstract guilt into tactile cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—why time slows in crisis—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened through the re-traumatization experiment.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore children’s sleep via goddess’s echo—signaled in paragraph one. Pressure escalates via pattern break: stars drift, frequencies shatter, paths dissolve; each intensification forces Kael to adapt (zigzag, grounding, net cast).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—clear her father’s legacy or let truth die—tightens via the alibi contradiction. Agency: her proof sketch narrows options to one path, forcing the call. Cost is the irrevocable break with past silence. Escalation is causal and single-turn, sufficient for length.

Escalation is causal and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—mend one shard of broken time before demolition—tightens when the orchard offers a single, costly intervention. Escalation is one deepening: from hopeless wandering to deliberate echo-weaving. The price is the pearl on the coin and the knowledge that her own timeline stays fractured. Agency drives every beat; coincidence only complicates.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to salvage meaning from the pill disaster—tightens when Aris realizes the pills only amplified somatic noise.

Escalation is textural density, not causal turns, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—translate isolation into independence without shattering—signaled early.

    Dominant stake (Kael perceiving vanishing-to-appear) tightens once: the stilling pond, star resurgence, and Elara’s adolescent departure narrow his worldview forever; the cost is palpable in Elara’s bodily diminishment.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—stillness as navigation—tightens when the arrowhead’s pulse replaces stone-skimming; the cost is the renunciation of motion itself. One clear escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming the sacred from automation—escalates through the keystone insertion and mist-walk surrender; cost is felt in the deliberate slowness and relinquishment of speed.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake: discover color of sound → luminous vow recharging the heart. One escalation: staying past tide’s turn locks option, visible frostbite cost in boots and soul-note. No slack pressure but complication kept compact.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—colony survival via cosmic alignment—is signaled early and tightened when the static resists clarity. The single meaningful turn is her successful distillation; the price is the gamble of random lots and the psychic weight of being sole arbiter.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—transform grief into named fears—tightens once when she chooses crystallization over reaping. Pressure grows via accumulating whispers; the final crystallization narrows her future path (she now carries named terrors, not souls). Cost is visible: the void “felt less like an abyss,” a reconfiguration with lingering weight.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—cosmic imbalance signaled early—tightens via drip-rate calibration; each five-second drop narrows options. Agency is renunciation/acceptance of partial victory with visible cost. No external reversals needed; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—whether to keep or broadcast the buried grief—is signaled by the photograph imperative. Pressure tightens once: the town’s reappearance forces the choice. Cost is visible in the tear-blurred vision and the grandfather’s lifelong burden. Agency is internal (renunciation of secrecy) and sufficient for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    Singlular stake is the fusion of logic and intuition before the “final transformation,” tightened from brute heat to celestial rhythm; cost = months of calculation risked and intuition reclaimed. Tension peaks when spiral dissolves into rain.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve citizens’ trust—tightens when the buckle’s failure threatens the canopy. Each micro-choice narrows options: climb or fall, revise or falter. The cost is the unending vigil itself, crystallized in the closing scan for the next fracture. No coincidence resolves; pressure is coherent and accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—custody of a consciousness—tightens once when Aris turns Kael’s corporate claim into a question of personhood. Escalation is causal: each move narrows legal options until the waiver falls. The cost is the corporate certainty Kael forfeits and the emotional flood Aris accepts. One decisive tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—safeguarding space for unconventional growth—is signaled early and tightens once: wild planting risks invasion, controlled planting risks private burden. One deepening beat: the realization the seed is a “test” reframes stakes from botanical to philosophical. Agency is decision-to-plant with visible cost (future containment labor). No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is the mounting wind density that forces the trade-off: shred the past to release it. Cost is visible in Elara’s raw throat and the engines’ dying roar. One meaningful tightening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—preserve dream/world membrane—signaled in first paragraph. One decisive tightening: instead of reinforcing walls, Elara chooses permeable dialogue, narrowing her tactical options from defense to stewardship. Cost is the relinquishing of absolute control, visible in the softened veil and her settling “onto her haunches” in acceptance. Pressure grows via Accumulative/Textural intensification of mist and light.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“interrupt destiny of perpetual failure”—is explicit and steadily deepened. Pressure escalates beat-by-beat: each failed attempt costs precious ember glow and dwindling twilight, narrowing options. No external antagonist required; Aris versus inherited failure enacts a clear trade-off. The visible price (final third of word-count) alters tactics from brute transmutation to coaxing life with gentler fire—an earned stance crystallization with on-page cost (tears, cracked crucible).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—capture the cosmic lullaby before perigee ends—tightens once when Elara discards filtering and retunes the array. The cost is the tower’s structural stress and the irreversible shift in her perception, legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—restore safe waterway passage—steadily narrows to one live option: merge timelines or never reach home. The tightening radio exchange dramatizes the irreversible cost as Leo trades permanent exile for collective safety.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—navigate by drowned starlight—is signaled early and tightens once when Kael’s skepticism forces Aris to prove the method in real time. The meaningful deepening is the hologram’s stabilization of Vega; cost is conceptual (trust in alien data) rather than visceral, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—protect Lily from imminent collapse—is signaled by the frantic pulse in the hearing aid. Escalation tightens once: from tracing a whisper to racing against structural failure. The tightening is driven by Elara’s choice to shove protocol aside; the price is the breach of her own professional boundary. Coincidence (photo surviving dry) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve Vale’s legacy before tide—tightens once, irreversibly, when water surges. Agency is continuous: each micro-choice (plunge hand, lift codex, sprint) escalates risk. Cost is visceral: scraped shoulders, burning lungs, lifelong burden of memory. No false reversals; coincidence (early tide) raises stakes, doesn’t solve them.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—save the dying Echo Tongue via texture-sound—is signaled early and tightened once: the diamond’s flaw threatens total failure, then the crack confirms the curse. Escalation is textural: each echo layer intensifies until the final silence. The cost (loss of the diamond, permanence of one translated texture) is legible. Coincidence of starlings is allowed to complicate, not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each sync attempt; the final uprooting forecloses the mechanical order. Escalation is causal: tentative flicker → hesitation → white-hot rupture. The price (statue’s collapse, orchard’s shift) is visible on the page. One meaningful turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—drones as last tenuous emissary of lost promises—escalates from bureaucratic stall to life-risk. Each increment (bottle-trigger, checkpoint reboot, drone launch) is origin-driven; only the cost to Aris is left slightly under-lit.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake: can silence be transmuted into living sound without losing the self forged in grief? Pressure tightens once: wind-bell chime marks the closing window; failure to sing means permanent exile in muteness. Escalation is accretive—each sensory detail thickens the cost of remaining silent. The final note forecloses muteness; cost is the reopening of a wound.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“find the place where stories live”—escalates via tactile warmth climbing her spine; the tightening spiral narrows options to one irreversible act. Cost is the invisible burden of guardianship.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prove sister alive and find her—tightens when dawn reveals coordinates. One meaningful escalation: discovery that light, not pigment, unlocks the cipher forces the irreversible choice to leave. Cost is the forfeiture of safe stasis. Pressure remains coherent under Causal lens; coincidence complicates (solstice alignment) but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Pressure sharpens when fear's vault pinches options; the escalating trade-off—longing as real cost—forces the single transformative choice.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when the Pleiades shard points to the ring. The single decisive turn is the palm-to-mushroom contact that reweights the entire quest. Cost is the emotional reckoning of misdirected blame. No escalation slack; pressure coils steadily.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—redeem exile via shard annotation—is signaled early and tightens once: Kael’s insight narrows Elara’s options from retreat to repair.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is the last cerulean hue; one cascade of pressure (plant the seed, risk her life, bet hope) narrows until the sapling’s first light reweights the valley’s spirit with undeniable luminous price.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—tightens with each knot: first a stranger, then her brother’s echo. Agency is renunciation/endurance: she keeps unravelling despite personal cost. The storm memory surges as burning silence, forcing a micro-turn where she must share the lullaby. Cost is felt in the ache that lingers after her brother settles.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore the chapel’s whisper—tightens once when clearing the fissure risks damaging fragile roots. Agency drives escalation; coincidence (rain) complicates but does not resolve. Cost is felt in the vault’s “weeping” frescoes and Elara’s tear-streaked face.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—ghost’s need for voice vs. Elara’s fear of using hers—tightens once: from reading symbols to singing aloud. Escalation is Accumulative: each graffito blooms brighter, bolt plate glows hotter, until song becomes inevitable. Cost is felt in the rusty voice breaking, but could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake—finding meaning beneath anguish—tightens as each decoded line narrows Elara’s emotional options; the final concealment forecloses open sharing, paying a social cost. One clear intensification suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove space remembers—tightens when the broken string isolates her at 30,000 ft; lenticular revelation forces trade-off between data and survival. Agency drives escalation: she chooses proof over oxygen, a visible price that forecloses rescue certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve the sky’s reflection—faces a live ticking clock. Escalation is one sustained tightening: each fractal stroke narrows time and raises stakes until the tremor fractures the pattern. Cost is visible in the ruined mirror and the tree’s final shudder. Agency remains tactile and irreversible.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—charting a path beyond the Veil—tightens when fog hides Solis, forcing Elara to decode starling choreography. One decisive deepening: realization that hopscotch clusters are coordinates, narrowing options from passive waiting to active triangulation. Cost is legible: acceptance of continued isolation in exchange for epistemic gain. Escalation is accumulative/textural—pattern density increases until the bearing crystallizes.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Eclipse-clock pressure tightens once, culminating in the micro-choice to listen rather than hammer; the visible cost is the surrender of control and the audible “soft click” that travels through her bones.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—survival against drought—signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is single but meaningful: each chalk message narrows tactics until the last forces a literal dig. Agency is collective yet driven by Kael’s relay; luck complicates but does not solve. Felt cost in exhaustion and shared labor.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—time’s unraveling—is signaled early and tightened through the pane of hush. One meaningful escalation: the stalled gears force Elias to pay decades of life to restart them. Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—guide travelers before frost or soul tightens—tightens once when frost crystals form as the travelers reach safety. Agency is clear: Elara’s exact exhalations steer the path. Cost is the frost on the nut and her unbroken chains. A sharper forfeiture (lost tool, stamina) would push 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—translate separation into connection—signaled by word 50. Pressure escalates via accumulative/textural lens: each foam spiral deepens the pattern until the Fibonacci moment reweights grief. No external antagonist needed; internal rigidity vs. fluidity supplies coherent tension. Cost legible: he forsakes perpetual penitence for an applied science that memorializes his daughter in every mended material.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.9)
    The dominant stakes—whether pristine absence or receptive void—tighten when Elara discovers that measured gaps serve parole; a single deepening is sufficient and the price (abandonment of her clean-slate gospel) registers faintly but visibly.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transform personal guilt without erasure—tightens when coral’s contagious remorse threatens to sharpen rather than sand the memory. One decisive turn: she chooses to submerge and distill, trading isolation for communal catharsis. Cost is legible in the dissolved coral and her steadied, no-longer-shaking hands.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—healing the fractured pulse between city and land—is signaled early and tightened through sonic escalation. The harmonic convergence is a decisive intensification under the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (shared vulnerability) rather than tangible, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—resurrect abandoned dreams—is signaled early and tightened when the neural storm forces a trade-off: personal identity for custodianship. The escalation is one sustained intensification under an Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the irreversible synaptic rewiring. No reversals, but the single deepening is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—locating and transmitting the seeds—crystallizes within an unforgiving hourglass; gravity clock ratchets pressure. Agency is decisive: every float, kick-off, and ink stroke narrows options to a single copy window. Final "carry the flame" crystallizes trade-off: knowledge vs solitude, though physical price is light.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—restore music to a silent world—is signaled in paragraph one. Escalation is a single deepening: each strum tightens the stakes by accelerating the sculpture’s ruin. Agency is active throughout; coincidence is absent. The tightening forecloses preservation, forcing the choice to play despite irreversible damage.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Exile’s solitude tightens into a single crystallizing choice: to offer the discovered beauty instead of demanding reinstatement. The covenant breach creates escalating moral pressure that forces renunciation with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake is clear: gain grandmother’s last entry. Each fork attempt escalates failure cost; the final success forecloses further pursuit by rendering the lock meaningless—visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—cultivating serenity within motion—tightens when the gale forces the pot to shatter and Elara must choose between rescue and trust. Escalation is one deepening beat: the seed’s survival now depends on her relinquishing control. Cost is her prior method; agency preserved.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“discover the source of resilience”—is signaled early and tightened once when the arrow tip’s vibration harmonizes with the planet’s memory, foreclosing the option to extract or exploit. Cost is visible: Elara pockets the tip not as conquest but as listener, accepting the humility of echo over ownership.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant stake—prevent another ghost town—is signaled early and tightened when the container shifts, forcing Elara to add structural vulnerability to her report. The cost is visible: she nearly dies, recalibrates, and the vow carries the weight of that near-loss.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—“certify wonder”—is signaled early and tightened once when the aurora’s arrival forces Kael to act. The cost (amber sheet drained, bells silent) is visible, though escalation is single-note rather than layered.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understand failure and find a new path—is signaled early. Escalation occurs through the failed flute attempt, tightening options from “play to open” to “listen to enter.” The cost is the relinquishment of the old method. Agency is present; coincidence does not intrude. A touch more visceral price (fatigue, injury) could have pushed it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to live with borrowed emotions—tightens when the fragment threatens to infect the press; Aris’s renunciation forecloses the analytical path. One meaningful deepening occurs when collective empathy collapses the equation. Cost is felt in the line “their own breath,” marking a forfeiture of detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—deliver relics while coaxing wonder—tightens when the flower moment forces a trade-off between haste and reverence. Escalation is one deepening beat under Accumulative lens; cost is the irreversible loss of Vanya’s presence. Agency is Kael’s decision to kneel, which reconfigures his route emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove objects absorb emotion—tightens when the frost starburst signals immediate feedback; the deepening shows projection, not absorption, forcing a costly reorientation of method and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—send the last message—tightens when the latest weave dissolves into silence. The puzzle pieces introduce a single, decisive intensification that rekindles the loom and forces the ultimate trade-off. Escalation is accumulative: each snapped thread raises the cost of continuation until sacrifice is the only path left. No coincidence resolves; the price is her existence.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—revive Veridia—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when Kael realizes the price is his voice. The single decisive turn occurs at the silk-pressing beat, narrowing options from “maybe I can speak again” to permanent silence. Cost is visceral: “searing cold shot up his arms.” No reversals needed; one meaningful tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—uncover the withheld truth—tightens when the vision reveals Lyra’s self-redirect. Pressure escalates via spontaneous bleed-throughs that cost Elara physical risk (near-miss arm) and ontological instability. The final tightening is Lyra’s silent command, foreclosing rescue and crystallizing cost.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—protect the promise of safety—escalates as the lamp dies and the harbor goes blind. One decisive tightening: Elara cannot relight the lamp, so she invents the stone language. Cost is the abandonment of the lighthouse’s traditional role, felt in the “guttering flame” she cradles metaphorically.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—forge dawn or drown the world—faces a single, escalating test: rogue wave jars lantern, scattering light. Agency is continuous micro-adjustment; each tweak alters shadow flow. Cost is the wick’s white-hot strain and the herald’s dissolution, felt on the page. One tightening suffices; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to magnetize stories—tightens once when the journal reframes the quest from pursuit to listening. The cost is quiet (abandoning active search) but legible; escalation is a single deepening rather than multiple reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“rekindle the dying realm”—is visceral and tightens through each sung thread; agency is cumulative singing that forecloses isolation. Cost is felt in Elara’s exhaustion and the orchard’s shuddering transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she remain hidden or risk connection—is signaled early and tightens through the ticking clock. The single meaningful intensification occurs at 11:58 when panic flares and is countered by the open book’s message, forcing the final stance crystallization. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of her “fragile equilibrium.”

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—guilt versus absolution—tightens through the locket’s discovery and the final renunciation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the photo redefines the bread from relic to living memory. Cost is visible: she forfeits the last crust and accepts perpetual tending instead of restoration.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single dominant stake—save the luminous vow from systemic oblivion—escalates from first paragraph’s “obsolescence” to needle-sharp tension when the hand in the slide blurs. The tightening is irreducible: each micro-adjustment, each hertz locked, literally dims the library further until only the vial’s glow survives; the cost is visible and felt.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—recording the exact sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and escalates through each thwarted near-brawl; the final ledger revelation tightens the noose, forcing the rupture with visible cost as blood replaces hush.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understanding carriers—tightens when ring reveals their ecological role, foreclosing pure research path. Escalation is textural: microclimates collide, tastes layer, equilibrium forms. Agency remains Aris’s interpretive act; cost is the irreversible shift from observer to participant. No external antagonist needed; pressure is epistemic and moral.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will she draw again?—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: the lock’s repair forces confrontation with the suppressed self-portrait. Cost is the terror on that sketch; escalation is internal but legible under Accumulative/Textural lens as density of memory and light intensify.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—recover lost voices—is signaled early and escalates through each truthful admission that reassembles the map. The tightening beat (“I’m afraid the Archive is gone”) narrows options and carries visible bodily cost. Closure is earned by her candor, not luck.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder via sonic translation—is signaled early and escalates through intensifying glisten and communal uptake. One meaningful deepening: the iceberg fragment’s internal stresses translate into audible truth, narrowing Elara’s remaining agency to surrendering her voice. Cost is visible—her throat tightens, silence begins. Coincidence (delivery of fragment) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—save the roses or lose the sole testament to beauty—tightens once when miniaturization becomes the only path. Escalation is causal and visible: each crack raises the cost of delay. The final burn exacts the dome’s destruction as price; tension never slackens.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    Dominant stake—unlocking the mailbox to heal communal grief—is signaled early and tightened through each neighbor’s testimony. However, escalation is informational rather than causal; no live option is foreclosed until the key turns. The cost is retrospective (Rajan’s decades of letters), not present-tense.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Water rise is relentless pressure with visible, felt cost tightening options once. Single stake—save Aegis—remains singular; no artificial reversals. Dance decision is active narrowing: only this cipher key opens the gate. Luck (dice roll) complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—recover deleted memories—is signaled early and tightened when the gravity pockets surge to release rather than steal. One meaningful deepening: the mother’s journal reframes the pockets as memory wells, forcing Aris to decide whether to reclaim or release. Cost is visible in the emptied chest and the irreversible mingling of flowers. No external antagonist needed; pressure is coherent and internal.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“to hush the prophecy”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the wing absorbs the last “coded shriek,” foreclosing any chance of escape. Escalation is one deepening under Accumulative lens; cost is the wing’s warmth and Elara’s open-ended vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—will Elara keep interrogating or accept the consoling fiction?—is signaled early and tightens once when Mrs. Thorne’s line “the lie was the language” forces a trade-off. Escalation is accumulative: each meteor, sip, and memory adds density until the final reconfiguration. Cost is felt in the burning eyes and the promise to “guard the silence.” No external reversals, but internal pressure suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—free herself from suffocating memory—signaled in paragraph 2. Escalation causal: each resonance alignment tightens the psychic vise until the final circle forecloses re-experiencing the memory. Visible price paid: the memory is extracted and sealed; she walks away unburdened yet bereft. No coincidence resolves; all pressure arises from her deliberate ritual choices.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore Lin’s lineage without exposing the restoration project—tightens once: the thorn’s pressure severs the false bond. Escalation is Accumulative: each drip, each breath, each micron of wax removed raises the cost of error. The price is the perpetual secrecy Elara must now carry.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake is early and stark: to discover the truth of selective echoing without joining the silent graveyard. Progressive disclosure escalates this by degrees—first verse at Dawn Cleft, twin shell sought from Elara—each step narrows options and heightens peril; Renn’s warning that “they’ll come” renders the cost legible and tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    The singular stake—can she retrieve an “unbroken memory” from a sunk ship fractured by human choice?—is sharpened one notch at a time: dream fragment reveals the lie → decoding raises cost of revelation → acceptance of collective responsibility tightens the remaining choices to “hold the memory publicly” or “bury it”; she endures the social shame of exposure but keeps the memory pure, the path narrowed and irrevocable.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—appreciation of hidden effort—tightens when the whistle transforms observation into participatory resonance; the cost is the irrevocable shift from spectator to witness. One clear intensification suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. comfortable lies—is signaled in paragraph two and tightened when “Initiate Verdant Protocol” proves the lie. One meaningful escalation: the orchard shifts from miracle to engineered crime scene, narrowing Lena’s options to carry the evidence out. Cost is visceral: the pack’s new weight and the orchard’s suddenly “deafening” quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—prevent atmospheric collapse—signaled early and escalates through each decoded fragment. One meaningful tightening: realization that Prophet aims to shatter the portico forces immediate sabotage. Cost is visible (exposed position, rerouted power). Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—bridging generations—tightens when the lullaby forces Silas to test his archive’s purpose. One meaningful deepening: from capturing sounds to releasing them, trading isolation for communion. Cost is the vulnerability of exposure and the irrevocable sharing of memory. Pressure remains coherent under Accumulative lens; no false escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—protect the sonic lattice—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by the vanishing sunset clock. One decisive turn: Aris’s micro-adjustment of the key forecloses retreat and locks the ice into stillness at visible physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—freeing the village’s spirit from fear—is signaled early and tightened when the youth’s anger threatens rash action. Escalation is Accumulative: each sensory beat (moon path, rain, magnetic pulse) layers pressure until the collective stillness becomes the decisive tactic. The cost is the forfeiture of violent catharsis, felt in the “sigh” of the first chain link. One minor slack: the elders’ hoarding is off-stage, slightly muting the visceral hunger that could sharpen stakes further.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—truth vs. bureaucratic silence—tightens when the scalpel and footprint prove murder; each clue raises personal cost. Agency is continuous: observation → collection → decision to defy. No coincidence resolves the conflict; the supervisor’s shoe size is earned deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—deliver Elias’s apology—tightens when the first repairman refuses, then escalates when Mrs. Gable accepts the risk. The tightening beat is the gear clicking into place; the cost is the chaplain’s acceptance that he too must receive forgiveness. Agency remains with Father Michael: he chooses to carry the box and the message.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—ring an inaudible bell—drives each beat. Escalation rises via causal steps: acid drip narrows prep window, kaleidoscope pulses force flight change, resonance demands unspoken yearning. Protagonist pays visible cost—abandons corroding foundation and accepts spiritual subscription to search. One meaningful tightening only, but sufficient for length.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake—rescue Leo’s consciousness—tightens as each fragment reassembles. Agency is Elara’s script launch; the price is Vance’s exposure and the archive’s notice. One clear escalation beat suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—empathy mapped onto safety—is announced early and escalates through causal shard retrieval; trust frays and rewinds visibly once projected vision arrests Kael’s fist. Cost crystallizes on the ice: shared patrol agreement and lantern-lit cliff path, legible social coin expended. Intensification is one decisive turn, adequate for 600–800 scope.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—learning the sound of endings—tightens once when the crack beneath her feet reveals she was already inside the ending. Agency is attention, not escape; the cost is the surrender of her timeline. Escalation is textural: density of sound and ice until the glacier’s sigh reweights everything.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—how to hold impossible love—tightens once when the letter’s survival reframes mismatch as generative. Pressure grows via Accumulative density rather than causal turns; the final stance crystallizes with visible cost (accepting distance). No external antagonist required.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—preserve the prophet’s echo—is signaled early and tightened when the clearing flickers. Escalation is one meaningful intensification: aligning breath with the parapet’s pulse turns threat into foundation. Cost is legible in Elara’s masked exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—transmuting private grief into communal resilience—is signaled early and tightened when Elara gives away her own artifact. Agency is exercised in each photograph placement; the final relinquishment forecloses her role as sole keeper. Cost is visible: the case ends empty. No coincidence resolves the arc; the vines’ slow triumph mirrors the irreversible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake: confirm or disprove that language still lives. Progressive frictions accumulate—the vowel shift of “verdant,” the breaking of “solitude”—so the pressure is felt rather than rationally solved. One decisive tightening is the moment the crystal rolls; acceleration is present, though the pay-price (renouncing publication) is more oblique than visceral. The score lands just below 8+ range because consequence is legible yet soft.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—capture the sound of aging—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by the garden’s erasure. The plink moment narrows all possibility to a single resonant note, foreclosing further search with audible cost. Agency remains Silas’s even as memory fails.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—capture the ephemeral despite instability—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when calibration fails. The meaningful turn is the decision to ride the tremors; price is the irrevocable acceptance of impermanence.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—“flawless goodbye”—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened by each added layer of mundane sound until the hymn fragment forecloses all other possibilities. Cost is visible in Aris’s last breath and Elara’s pulsing stillness. Agency is Elara’s curatorial attention; no external reversals needed.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—preventing isle-shattering eruption—signaled early. Escalation is causal: each corrected rune tightens the noose of possibility until the final loop snaps shut, foreclosing the option of finding Varn alive. Cost is palpable: the shadow-shard confirms Varn’s self-sacrifice. No coincidence resolves; agency drives every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—how to live with the cleft in certainty—tightens once when Elara decides to plant the tooth as public teaching tool, trading private grief for communal guidance. Cost is visible: she forfeits the comfort of forgetting. Pressure grows under Accumulative/Textural lens via density of memory and object resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—flameless light for a fire-fearing village—is signaled early and tightened through each polishing beat. The final display glows with visible cost: Elara gives away the last fragment that once consoled her grief. Pressure escalates via texture, not reversals, fitting the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—shame transformed—tightens once via the fractal pattern revelation; Elara’s agency drives the proffering beat. Cost is legible but could be sharper; still meets single-turn escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—collect hopes before personal “book closed”—tightens as each cameo grows more fragile. The decisive turn: relinquishing collection, accepting transience. Cost is legible in the shell’s retained fracture and his solitary departure. Escalation is textural: increasing resistance of the nexus to preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—restore sacred practices before next harvest moon—is signaled early and tightened when threads fray. The tightening beat (missing verse) raises cost; the stone’s insertion resolves, but the price is communal rather than personal, keeping tension just shy of visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—preserve Lina’s heartbeat against extinction—is signaled early and escalates through the eclipse’s “moving stillness.” The final sealing is a decisive narrowing of options: once the vial is sealed, the map is fixed and the chance to alter it is gone. Cost is legible but slightly abstract; a more visceral forfeiture would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—capture the season’s last echo before winter silences it—is signaled early and tightened by the ticking lull. Escalation is Accumulative: each failed angle increases the pressure of time and silence. The decisive turn—tilting the prism at dusk—narrows options to one shot; the cost is the irreversible sealing of Silas’s laughter. No external antagonist needed; the wounded season itself supplies coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—collect burdens without being consumed—tightens when each stone adds literal weight. Agency is ritual precision; each orientation forecloses escape further. Felt cost accrues beat by beat.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: transform unbearable absence into bearable form. Pressure escalates as crystallized time thickens; the kettle’s rising whistle and the blank’s unyielding weight tighten the moment until the knife descends. The single decisive act—first cut—costs the tear and commits her to the irreversible path. No external antagonist needed; grief itself is the coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—retrieve 100 fragments to negotiate with her ghost—is signaled early; each shard collected incrementally raises emotional cost. One clear tightening at 99/100 forces the final wade; cost is felt in the trembling hands and the ghost’s dissolution, though escalation is more accretive than sharply causal.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake is human renewal from ruins, signaled early and intensified when geothermal power surges back through terminal wiring. The sextant fragment tightens the beat—precise angle redirects redundant volts—fracturing a path that felt impossible moments ago. Cost is visible: sparks hiss, hands steady despite choking dust. No coincidence resolution; luck is a symptom of agency.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reconciling with abandoned perfection—is signaled early and tightened once: bear’s presence forces Elias to renounce the quest. Cost is felt in the “weight resting lightly now.” Agency is renunciation, not confrontation; sufficient for 600-word scope. No escalation beyond single deepening, but that deepening is decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake—exposing the lie—surfaces early and tightens once when the inscription reframes the myth as land fraud. Agency is present: she decides to archive-hunt, forfeiting the glamour of legend-chasing. Pressure is cerebral, not visceral; no tangible price is dramatized on page, keeping escalation just shy of high-band punch.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—preservation of seed resilience—is signaled early and tightened when the decoded spiral offers a concrete path; the cost is the irreversible commitment of tonight’s labor and tomorrow’s planting. One meaningful deepening suffices under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Single dominant stake—mapping healing landscapes—tightens as each obituary deepens choice toward witnessing rather than erasing absence; cost is visible in Varek and Silas echoes that lock Elara out of flight.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—reawaken beauty—tightens through each beat: discovery raises hope, assembly raises stakes, cracked shell forces acceptance of imperfection. Escalation is driven by Elian’s agency under Accumulative lens; cost is visible in the trembling palace and the stunted chick. No coincidence resolves the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—prove land can heal—tightens when grafting becomes irreversible act; each sprinkle of sand raises stakes (mineral bridge or failure). No external reversals, but internal deepening (hearing the scar’s “song”) forces crystallized stance. Cost is legible: irrevocable time spent, emotional exposure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.2)
    Dominant stake – liberate memories – tightens once when the geese pause provides cosmic thinning; each breadcrumb narrows options until only drop-by-drop pouring remains; visible price is exhaustion embodied by her knees aching in the ritual kneel.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    The dominant stake—deliver light without fire—tightens when the desolation sector’s faint echo answers the ping, proving prior fire-based failure. Elara’s agency narrows to a single, irreversible seed release; the cost is the silence that follows, the garden’s future now contingent on her non-destructive gift. One meaningful intensification suffices under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.0)
    Dominant stake: to discover a shareable form for unspeakable loss. Escalation is pattern-deepening: every ribbon tied narrows solitude and widens communal shape until the monarch vessel forecloses private memorializing. External complication (migration timing) intensifies pressure rather than supplies miraculous rescue. Visible price: final tears plus renunciation of stone permanence in favor of fragile wings.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—restore Veridian’s shared balance—is signaled early and tightened through each beat: frozen pendulum → town chaos → personal guilt → calibrated bob. One meaningful turn at the pendulum’s pause narrows options to perfection or perpetual failure. Cost is the irreversible surrender of lifelong penance ritual. Agency is Elias’s alone; coincidence (handle washing up) complicates, not resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—decode Silas’s warning before memory dies—tightens once: the border threads’ glyphs narrow from chaos to a single plea. Escalation is accumulative/textural: each untangled strand increases density of meaning until the final constellation locks in. Cost is the irreversible burden of remembrance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—seed innovation or surrender to ice—is signaled early and tightens through each calibration note; the seven-day thaw window narrows options to a single irrevocable stroke, with the cost of potential flood or deeper freeze legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—“teach dust to speak”—tightens through escalating risk: static clears, lyrics sharpen, patrols loom. One decisive intensification: the final cloak turns silence into testimony, foreclosing her anonymity. Cost is the fresh patrol risk she now shoulders.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake—truth versus myth—signaled early and tightened when Kael kicks silt into the trench. One meaningful deepening: the sediment layers visibly narrow Kael’s certainty. Cost is social (Kael’s retreat) rather than personal, keeping it just shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—restoring the choir’s capacity to listen—is signaled in paragraph two. Escalation is accretive: each rehearsal subtracts internal noise, tightening the emotional vise until the final concert becomes the test. Cost is palpable: weeks of “fragile unlearning.” No coincidence resolves the rift; the shift is earned.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—reclaiming beauty from ruins—is signaled early and tightens through each pruning cut. The celestial alignment acts as a live clock, intensifying the need for purity before the moment passes. The final tightening is the emergence of the shoot, foreclosing despair with earned, visible cost (her all-night vigil).

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—preserve wonder amid systemic collapse—is signaled early and tightened when Elara chooses to reveal the riddle despite risk. One meaningful escalation: the stranger’s arrival forces the truth compulsion into the open, narrowing Elara’s options from silent observer to active truth-teller. Cost is visible: she loses anonymity and accepts the tower’s vulnerability. Agency drives the turn; coincidence (the stranger) complicates rather than resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—why some houses feel alive—tightens through successive tests; each placement narrows the mystery and raises emotional cost. The Finnegan house supplies the decisive deepening: a fragile warmth returned, not guaranteed. Cost is felt in Elara’s tears and the root’s silence—no reset, no luck.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—“truth versus liveable order”—tightens as each revelation strips away certainty and forces Aelius toward embracing fragility. One meaningful deepening: fracture threaded not sealed by force but by accepting the crack. Cost is palpable—myth of Council malice must die so city may live.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—capture the texture of refusal—is signaled early and tightened by each failed proof. Escalation is one decisive intensification: rupture offers escape, but true cost is recreating hesitation. Agency drives every turn; coincidence complicates (die roll) but does not resolve. Price is the perpetual descent itself.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake is clear: keep language alive vs city amnesia. The middle beat (painting word) narrows options to public intervention. Cost is largely emotional; physical risk to artist or plant is absent, softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single dominant stake—loss of cultural memory—escalates as thaw accelerates. One meaningful tightening: ritual bread becomes rescue tool, foreclosing passive remembrance. Agency is Elara’s; coincidence does not resolve. Price is the elders’ trembling and the soaked stone underfoot.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—“to step beyond fate’s design”—is signaled early and tightened through the escalating tide and the stone’s awakening; the final sideways orbit forecloses linear time with visible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dominant stake—trick fear into revealing its weakness—is signaled in the whisper’s first command and escalates through each paradox. One decisive tightening: Clara turns the camera on herself, trading the curse for visibility. The price is the clasp’s dying glow and the advisor’s silence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; coincidence never resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—understand the watchers—is signaled early and tightened when the map arrowing toward them becomes visible. One meaningful escalation: the whistle’s note moves from hypothesis to key, forcing the irreversible crack. Cost is felt immediately in the dread that “pressed down like the weight of the turtle shells overhead.”

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant stake anchored from line 2: retrieval or surrender of submerged dreams. Tightening comes when the watercolors appear—loss is no longer abstract; the choice shifts from documentation to re-embedding. Escalation under Accumulative lens: density of artifacts rises and forecloses simple cartography. Cost (stone-mortar labor, surfacing in weighted boots) is tactile and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake—truth of the First Accord—tightens as each stamped page narrows the evidentiary field. One decisive deepening: the discovery that the stamp was used to forge unity reweights the entire archive. Cost is the cognitive and professional rupture with her prior mandate.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—transform Kael’s last dream into bearable light—tightens once: the geode resists, the dream wounds, yet she persists. The cost is visceral (sobs, scalding tears) and persistent (soul dragging), narrowing her future to endless climbs.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single, escalating stake—finding evidence that annihilated futures are recoverable—tightens through sensor calibration choices and circuit time-pressure ending in array scream and geode flare. Cost (foreclosure of earlier life) sits raw in the final viewport overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake—“decode the frequency of belonging”—tightens once, when star-trails converge and the single beat of pulling the chip forecloses all other quests. Cost is audible in the resonant stones and her tear-blurred vision, but the pressure curve is more crescendo than escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—uncovering Elara’s fate—tightens when the watch hand proves his complicity in her death. Escalation is causal: each sifted fragment raises the chance of confronting guilt; the discovery forces renunciation. Cost is palpable in the bleeding fist and the irrevocable turn from the sea. No coincidence resolves; pressure is coherent under the causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake—freeing Vanya to recycle his own failure—is signaled early and tightened by the moon’s waning. One decisive intensification: the envoy’s nod triggers the untethering, foreclosing Aris’s lingering self-punishment. Cost is visible in the still-closed fist around the pull. Agency remains entirely Aris’s.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—will Leo choose presence or perpetual escape—tightens with each pole passed. Escalation is causal: each remembered missed milestone raises the emotional tariff until the phone becomes the single remaining option. No external antagonist is needed; regret itself supplies coherent pressure. The final narrowing to “one stroke, one pole” crystallizes the trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant stake—prove empathy—is signaled early and tightened when Silas forfeits the quicker path. The submerged route raises physical cost (burning lungs) and moral stakes (girl vs. exit). One meaningful turn: giving away the baseball forecloses self-interest. Clock declared but not leveraged; slight under-escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake—undo death—escalates from cookie prophecy to scarcity of spices to bound phoenix cycle, each tightening forecloses one option. One central press intensifies through agency; cost manifests in irrevocably changed bond form. Escalation coherent under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Felt pressure keeps mounting: each reclaimed second costs more ink, more remorse, until the decisive pour narrows Elara’s path to irreversible permission to mother.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—free the trapped souls—tightens when shadows solidify into grasping hands, forcing Elara to risk her last reserves. The single deepening (embracing her own darkness) narrows options and visibly costs her buoyant life-force. Pressure escalates under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake—child’s fever vs. night risk—tightens once when Aris kneels to gather shards and feels the tremor ease. Cost is the risked journey and the broken bottle; escalation is modest but coherent under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—ignite silent revolution before dawn—is signaled in paragraph one and tightened when the blackout becomes the only window. One meaningful turn: the sundial click forecloses retreat; any mis-step now dooms the cells. Cost is the irreversible breach of her sworn duty, felt in the warm bronze and her vanishing act.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—understand sacred patterns—tightens when rigid Fibonacci sequences fail and the only remaining option is surrender to the curse. The micro-turn (breaking the sequence) narrows choices to one: obey the vision. Cost is the loss of certainty; the eels’ perfect helix vanishes, leaving only the act of seeking. Pressure escalates via aurora violence and stone slippage, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—finding truth in silence between strikes—tightens through escalating storm and timer ritual. Each timed pause forecloses avoidance; final 15-second interval crystallizes stance. Cost is the emotional exposure of speaking after years of silence. Agency resides in Silas’s decision to measure and finally voice, not in storm coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake—secret treaty terms—tightens when the duel replaces diplomacy; each parry narrows Silas’s spatial options until only the seventh-hole alignment remains. Escalation is causal, visible, and paid for with physical risk; the anthem revelation forecloses continued combat without further blood. Cost is legible but not viscerally sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake—will tonight’s line survive the city’s hunt—tightens when Elias chooses to scatter the blanks, trading stealth for reach. Cost is felt: the act makes the Penny Poet easier to track, yet the seed is planted. One clear escalation suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dominant stake—retrieve Leo before true dark—tightens with every paragraph as the bruised-purple horizon bleeds upward. Agency is sonic, not mechanical; each chord narrows options until the final note forecloses retreat. The cost is legible: if the gamble fails, she loses both Leo and her last night of concealment.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake—protect cultural memory via seed—signaled early. Escalation is causal: time tightening, monsoon approaching, seed must sprout. One meaningful tightening when Lyra’s song becomes the only viable key. Cost is the irreversible exposure of memory to communal flood; no coincidence resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake—finding the color of unspoken apologies—is signaled early and tightened when the beam reveals the coral hue. The single deepening (lace-guided tug) forces a trade-off: symbolic sight for ongoing penance. Cost is the daily tending of wounds, made explicit in the final pruning. Agency remains Kai’s throughout; coincidence complicates but does not resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake (rejecting drama for gradual truth) tightens through her dust-mapping agency; conceptual cost of abandoning forced narratives is legible in "weight lifting." One decisive deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through the ledger's cryptic notations evolving from "Canyon West" to payment coordinates, narrowing options to tracking. Protagonist agency drives escalation via frost-pattern interpretation, but time pressure ("dawn bled") lacks a live clock that actively alters moves beyond the melting evidence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation under Accumulative lens deepens via protagonist agency: distorted thermal data (anger where mourning expected) forces Elara to seek lilies' steadiness, narrowing options to the resonator. Botanist's tears and Elara's first smile since the shipwreck manifest unmistakable cost.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation via sensory deepening: distress signals evolve from "frantic SOS" to "calming pulse," narrowing options to one irreversible act. Cost ("rest forever deferred") is visceral in the deferred peace, but pressure lacks one tangible loss (e.g., tool failure).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Elias's agency: his declaration ("they see us") crystallizes the dominant conflict (survival vs. cultural extinction) with felt cost in the "fragile victory," narrowing options under Accumulative escalation where each donation reweights hope.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency: breath control transforms perception, then the tear’s activation. Dominant stake (locating unused love) tightens when observation shifts to participation, with visceral cost ("dissolving the stagnant pool"). Accumulative lens flawlessly executed—density peaks as gold threads emerge, narrowing options to a single act of release.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Dominant stake (escaping temporal prison vs. preserving memories) tightens when the fragment becomes accessible, forcing irreversible agency. Cost is visceral: daughter's photo dissolving into "silver mist" as direct consequence of Aris's choice. Pressure coheres under causal lens—no coincidence resolves conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.2)
    Wall collapse tightens options relentlessly under Accumulative lens; "minutes, perhaps seconds" creates visceral clock. Agency-driven escalation (decoding, planting) with visible cost (her death) meets 9+ quick test for unmistakable on-page price.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through accumulative pressure: aurora flaring, filtered silence stripping noise, then the "shard of ice" ping. Her agency in calibrating the array drives escalation, with conceptual cost undeniable in realizing the sound "confirmed the permanence of the void."

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (decoding maternal legacy) tightens through moonbeam revelation to Track 13, with visible cost in "luminous disbelief" tears; pressure grows via Accumulative density shift, though antagonistic pressure remains atmospheric rather than actively opposing.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (crafting safe zones vs. environmental/personal thaw) signaled early. Escalation driven by Elias' agency—water rise forces abandonment choice. Villagers' conflict remains abstract, limiting visceral stake escalation despite physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.7)
    Stakes tighten via Maya's agency: cipher breakthrough transforms smudges into actionable evidence, narrowing options to exposure; cost is unmistakable in trembling-hands filming amid phobia resurgence.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (naming the dark) tightens through protagonist’s active silence-mapping; cost (absolute darkness) legible at closure. Escalation driven by agency under Accumulative lens but secondary pressure (fort’s shuddering) lacks causal integration.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Unit 7's agency: failed loop attempts narrow options to amalgamation. Cost ("last loop") legible in "no further resets," but moral calculus lacks competing goods beyond "imitation vs. truth."

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency: lens magnification deepens knowledge (doodles→coordinates), eavesdropping tightens stakes, and her transparency act forecloses observer complicity. Cost legible in dissolved isolation; musicians' reconciliation slightly abrupt but redeemed by doodle mirroring.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten through her agency: the lever's calibrated resistance forces precise action during the narrow "sacred quiet" window. Cost is visceral in "tears freezing" and the implied years of struggle paid for this solitary vindication.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Elias' agency under Accumulative lens: water patterns deepen pressure until droplet reveals tunnel map. Cost legible in physical risk and emotional weight ("burden and gift"), narrowing options to one irrevocable path forward.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation via Accumulative lens is masterful: smudge irreversibly deepens the dominant stake (quantifying guilt), narrowing options to acceptance; cost ("space it occupied within her margins") is visceral and legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency: panic at collapse → retreat to refuge → deliberate refolding to witness transformation. Dominant stake (witnessing vs preserving) tightens via her choice to burrow "through silence," with visible cost in lost codices. Accumulative lens elevates pressure through pattern break (destruction→rebirth), avoiding causal requirements for this design.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stakes (wonder vs. anxiety) tighten as the eclipse deepens, yet escalation relies too heavily on the eclipse itself as coincidence; Elara’s agency in "softly adaptive" choices feels passive during the pivotal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    Dominant stake (preserve stories) signaled early but pressure never coheres or tightens. No escalation: Clara’s diaries present static mystery, not rising complication. Stakes remain abstract ("weight of world’s end") without visceral cost. Agency is observation, not decision-making under pressure—violates band guardrails.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Elara's agency—narrowing beam per specs under storm pressure—forecloses survival option with felt cost (physical/emotional exhaustion crystallizing her new role).

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate causally through the bell countdown and widening cracks, narrowing Anselm's options to vocalizing belief.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stake (mending for meaning vs oblivion) tightens via workshop collapse (beam shearing, green vapor). Agency shines in pockmark alignment under pressure, but acid surge coinciding with statue completion slightly softens causality of the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake (release from grief) tightens through protagonist's agency in shell placement; cost legible in "lighter chest" and altered perspective. Single deepening beat suffices at this length, but mirror crack urgency lacks active clock pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (stop celestial hemorrhage) escalates causally: dreams revealed as grotto’s memory narrow options to mending, not fleeing. Cost is visceral—starlight pools’ grave-cold forcing dizziness—resolved through agency ("Enough" command), not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency when whispered truth makes "density of presence" crushing; vial failure forces trade-off (artificial light vs. shared warmth) with felt cost in tears and capped sun.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: acknowledging envy ("I see you") transforms pressure rather than resolves it, narrowing options to integration. Felt cost ("weight lifted") reconfigures chronology without erasing temporal fracture, deepening under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Chen’s vulnerable line about the "hour of waking" clepsydra—a live option foreclosed by his grief.

    Escalation driven by agency: Elara’s wiring choice intensifies scent/current under Accumulative lens, reweighting "imperfect miracles" as the orchard’s doom presses in. Cost crystallizes in "some endings were necessary"—visible trade-off between accepting loss and creating "fertile" renewal.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (unifying reality) is clear but remains abstract; pressure stems from contemplation, not external constraints. Escalation via conceptual deepening lacks protagonist agency—the "unification" act resolves without visible cost or tactical trade-off, undermining tension.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten through Aris’s counting ritual, narrowing options to the sun’s green flash moment.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.5)
    Escalation driven purely by Elara's agency under causal lens: curiosity compels interception, then surrender, with cost crystallized in "she'd bypassed security by working through barriers"—a tangible forfeiture of her role's core function that reshapes all future tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (probability vs. hope) signaled early with "hollowness of rebellion."

Cost is visceral in her throat tightening and the final classroom addition—conceptual price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Silas's agency when Elena calls back: rejecting her ("Wrong number") forecloses connection with visible cost ("throat tightened"). Dominant stake (estrangement vs. human contact) tightens meaningfully in the second call.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten when teens arrive—not coincidence resolving conflict but complicating it—forcing Elara’s agency in the vellum handoff.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: pen reactivation narrows options to one fragile attempt. Cost is unmistakable in the final image—emptiness of the pen and unresolved outcome crystallize the stake’s weight. "Fleeting windows" tightens temporal pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Dominant stake (deliver coin by dawn) escalates through Silas's agency: storm worsens radio failure, Overseer Rourke appears. Cost is visceral—thigh pressure from coin, humming metal beneath palms. Each solution (pebble flick, gait mimicry) narrows options under causal pressure without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen via light-pattern density ("geometric shapes bloomed"), but escalation lacks visible cost on guardian. Child's transformation is earned, yet guardian's "weight of unshed tears" remains abstract rather than altering her tactics mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation through sensory deepening: whale song vibrations → scrimshaw warmth → gills blooming. "Combative tenderness" pressure narrows options until detachment becomes inevitable. Cost is legible in "calloused hands of dockworkers" versus "embrace of the deep."

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.0)

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes (freeing creativity vs. crushing weight) tighten via Elara's agency: each traced meteor path releases fragments, escalating pressure until the "urgent" final star.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten via twilight’s deepening and ferry crossing under Accumulative lens; courage-as-crossing realization reweights options, but the leash break’s cost lacks visceral on-page demonstration beyond metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.3)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: discoloration discovery deepens abstract "cost of safety" into concrete bolt-relic, narrowing options to remain as witness.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)

    Dominant stake (vanishing paths) tightens through Aris's evidence assembly, with revelation narrowing options to irreversible loss.

Minor abstraction in "periodically eternal" doesn't obscure stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.6)
    Escalation is pure causal agency: bulldozers crushing shoots force urgency, then vent heat physically narrows options. Cost is undeniable—"elders might call her insurgent still" juxtaposed with land’s validation—reconfiguring tradition’s meaning through the hybrid plant’s irreversible emergence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes deepen through somatic escalation (freeze → tunneling vision → stillness), but the external cliff erosion lacks concrete pressure on the present action. Cost is legible in the photograph’s physical decay yet feels slightly detached from the immediate beat.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through thread-untangling beats—The World's knot forces trade-off between "perfect art" belief and embracing fragmentation; cost is her artistic identity, visible in hands stained with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven entirely by Silas’s agency: simulating trauma to flare ink patterns narrows options to a single, brutal realization. Cost is undeniable—"stone in her gut"—and the Accumulative lens intensifies pressure through ink’s fading dance without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single dominant stake (finding meaning amid uncertainty) tightens through the emergent hush—a meaningful deepening where collective stillness demands action. Elara's agency drives the resolution (reshaping sand), with visible cost in her tear and the blurred mandala. Cost is unmistakable in "lilac unease transformed into gentle resolve," though escalation relies on one intensification as permitted.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: tessera placement transforms abstract "truth" into concrete script, narrowing options (rename or erase). Cost legible in Varr's faltering expression—conceptual price of righteousness crumbling—but secondary pressure from crews slightly dilutes dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative escalation: sensory overload ("burnt wiring mixed with night-blooming jasmine") deepens the dominant stake (mending timeline before demolition).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation via deepening knowledge: pills' failure reframes as somatic echo discovery, narrowing options to the light-rig solution.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes crystallize early: isolation as cage vs independence through coexistence. Escalation driven by Elara’s agency—aligning sundial, kneeling to feel vibration—tightens pressure until dawn’s light forces the memory/hum collision.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Dominant stake tightens meaningfully when compass settles on resonance, but escalation falters as organ vibration (external force) resolves spatial mutiny without Elara's agency, violating "coincidence may complicate not resolve" rule.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through agency: deciphering stanza → keel epiphany forecloses escape. Cost (self-exile continuation) legible in "She wouldn't leave," though jet stream timeframe lacks tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (proving "never" wrong) tightens when tarp reveals path, forcing descent.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Elias’ agency (drawing symbols to redefine territory), but scavengers remain off-page, diluting pressure; cost ("hollow promises of disruption") feels earned yet slightly abstract for high-band escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (preserving migrating identities) tightens when the creel "hummed" during smelting, forcing Elara’s stance crystallization; cost is legible in "hand steady despite the moon’s wane" but moon-phase constraint remains passive.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)

    Stakes escalate through Aris's deciphering of vows and key tag, narrowing options toward the emerald tone revelation. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but lacks visible cost—no forfeiture alters tactics beyond internal shift. Band guardrail blocks 8.8+ as the "courage" glow remains untethered to sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes (colony survival through alignment) escalate via static's resistance deepening doubt. Agency-driven resolution (prism adjustment) with visible emotional cost. Minor deduction: conceptual cost needs more physical manifestation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)

    Stakes deepen via Aris's "improbable longing" as pressure, yet "fear’s vault" remains abstract; cost is felt but not viscerally tied to her physical state beyond "ache like a bruise" during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through Aris’s shifting understanding ("stolen" to "preserved"), but escalation lacks a meaningful tightening beat; the single deepening turn (mushroom touch) reweights knowledge without narrowing options under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation is pure Accumulative pressure: tea leaves’ triangle deepens the stake, then Kael’s crack insight forces Elara’s stance crystallization. Cost is visceral in her years of guilt lifting as "the weight of her past failure crashed over her," directly altering her annotation choice.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Accumulative lens: "soul-parched" valley’s hollow despair tightens as essence capture intensifies with memory’s "sudden ache." Cost is felt in her pressing through grief ("sacrifice" implied), narrowing options to one ritual act that forecloses further delay.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (grounding spirits) tightens through brother's knot escalation. But pressure lacks visible mid-process cost: no tactical shift when silence shifts from cold to burning. Brother's resolution pays cost, but escalation feels compressed without earned adaptation between knots.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through sapling obstruction forcing airflow restoration, not excavation. Agency-driven escalation culminates in the brush clearing, with visible cost in her tears and the vault’s weeping frescoes foreclosing division.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (understanding "letting go") tightens through Silas’s agency: the note’s discovery transforms abstract physics into embodied wisdom, foreclosing his analytical clinging. Cost is unmistakable—"weight... transformed"—but urgency could heighten; the ocean’s pressure subtly raises stakes without dominating the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single stake (articulating needs) tightens meaningfully when ghost shifts from "hunger" to requesting song; Elara's singing decision forecloses silence with visible cost, though lightning/thunder timeframe's pressure isn't actively tracked during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake tightening crystallizes when shadowed elevator threatens revelation loss, then sunbeam refraction forces active choice (tilting goggles), with cost legible in "throat tightened" over dead mint garden.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant stake (proving cosmic memory) tightens through the lenticular cloud’s spiral revelation, forcing abandonment of survival for memorialization. Cost is visceral via oxygen warnings, though escalation relies heavily on internal deepening rather than external pressure shifts under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: noting patterns abandons passive waiting for active observation. Cost is visceral ("sociable isolation now sweet with purpose"), but phrasebook dog-ear’s convenience slightly undermines escalation—feels like plot amnesia that the cipher wasn’t spotted earlier despite her curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes viscerally felt through "world below would stall," escalated by accumulating prophecy density and eclipse deepening. Agency pure in listening action; cost undeniable as nostalgia transforms into "quiet pride." One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate causally from failed irrigation to water discovery, but cost remains abstract until the gush. Band guardrail for 8.8+ requires visible price charging final image; here relief dominates without showing prior sacrifices.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Agency-driven escalation via Elara’s path assembly narrows options (frost deadline/bird patrols), with visceral cost in trembling hands. Stakes deepen when guiding travelers crystallizes as potential soul-freedom path.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten through Aris’s agency: observing river foam transforms abstract grief into actionable insight ("separation wasn’t termination but transformation"), with the felt cost of "loosened grief" altering his tactics toward healing polymers.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.6)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: measuring voids' "specific geometry" narrows options from abstract seeking to precise action, with visceral cost in shattered identity ("clean slate vendor finally understanding"). Dominant stake signaled immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven solely by Elara's agency: analyzing pools → digging → subsuming remorse → distilling broth. Cost unmistakable as her memory "sharpening instead of sanding," foreclosing solitary erasure for communal endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (city-farm disconnection) signaled early via farmers’ whispers; escalation through density increase (vibrations → harmonic dialogue) reweights cost under Accumulative lens. Agency clear in Eliska’s adjustments, with visible cost (physical strain, emotional tears). Single deepening (weight freed → elevator responds) suffices, though secondary stake (clock’s fracture) lacks interweaving with internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.6)
    Dominant stake (resurrecting dreams) signaled early, but pressure fails to deepen meaningfully; "quaking reverie" deepening alters knowledge without narrowing options or altering tactics, violating band guardrail for 8.8+ escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten causally under pressure: countdown ("minutes left"), fading symbols, and "first pebble drifted downward" force urgent copying. Agency clear in harvest timing, cost visible in fading light. Slight over-explanation of "seeds could turn to embers" reduces visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist agency: correlating shooting star to bishop move forecloses political redemption path. Visible cost (tear, dent) alters tactics toward "offering solution," fulfilling Accumulative escalation with conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten via the fireworks deadline and clasp’s resistance, with Elara’s agency driving escalation through fork trials; the visceral cost of "weight of what she’d recover" is unmistakable, though the single reversal lacks deeper tactical adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven by agency: storm destroys rigidity, then observing replaces watering. Cost unmistakable in "ambition to force understanding dissolved" as deepening reweights the stake under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative escalation: the arrow’s vibration deepens knowledge, forcing Elara’s stance crystallization (pressing it against the arch). Cost is unmistakable in the "stark contrast" between the tip’s coldness and saplings’ warmth, reconfiguring her mission from discovery to carrying forward memory. One meaningful deepening suffices for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    Single micro-turn (container collapse) meaningfully tightens stakes by adding structural vulnerability to her report, with visible cost in the near-miss and "patch felt heavier"; agency drives escalation through her recalibration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (certify wonder) tightens via chisel-strike timing, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—Kael merely follows aurora hues. Cost ("world crumbles") is declared not dramatized; no visible forfeiture or altered tactics. Band guardrail for 8.8+ fails: no price charges final image, though "sculpted hush" reweights meaning through Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake ("weaving between worlds") signals early, but remains abstract; cost legibility falters until epiphany. Needed visible price (e.g., physical toll) during failure to tighten escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Kael’s agency: his choice to "germinate" wonder by using the pendant transforms dread into resolve. The cost—intensified sorrow over Vanya’s absence—is legible in the climax ("Vanya wasn’t here to share this"). Single deepening suffices for length, with pressure narrowing options to endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (proving emotion absorption) tightens via protagonist’s agency: her focus triggers the prism’s flare and jagged starburst. Escalation under Accumulative lens—density increase in frost patterns forecloses her life’s work with visceral cost ("all her research... rested on truthful lies").

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten through Accumulative density (threads dissolving → re-emerging light) with visible cost (Elara's dissolution), but the puzzle's coincidental discovery undermines protagonist agency in escalation despite strong pressure buildup to the recommencement beat.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes tighten through Kael’s agency: mine descent bypasses surface instability, ritual forces trade-off (voice for resilience). Cost is unmistakable in "searing cold" drawing essence and "profound emptiness," reweighting options as Veridia’s pulse replaces speech.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.5)
    Stakes (truth's weight) tighten through sensory escalation: hydraulic arm near-miss proves kinetic bleed, then Lyra's sacrifice reweights "crushing pressure" into resonant gravity. Cost is unmistakable—"voluntary surrender" felt in "bone-jarring" physicality and insubstantial ghosthood.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (shaping dawn) tightens via wave-induced misalignment, narrowing options to Elara’s realignment choice. Her agency in steering "broken" light creates irreversible cost (doubt nearly dooming the world), escalating pressure under Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Escalation driven by protagonist agency: tracking sun trails deepens the stake (understanding magnetism) through failure (shifting angles), narrowing options until the journal’s discovery forces renunciation of her quest with visible cost in her changed greeting of patrons.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen organically as Aris shifts from "what trees saw" to "what they held," with the cost of redefined purpose made visible in his skin's mending; agency drives the dream-deconstruction turn under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through textural accumulation: the clock’s chimes narrow options while the book’s appearance deepens knowledge (wisdom in imperfection), forcing her to confront isolation’s "slow suffocation." Agency shines in her micro-choice to align the invitation with the book’s page. Cost is legible—"fragile equilibrium" broken—but escalation leans slightly on the Circle’s external intervention rather than solely protagonist-driven pressure under peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stake (guilt over passive acceptance) tightens through locket discovery, forcing active remembrance. Pressure coheres via Accumulative lens: vanished bakery → found photo → gardening as rebellion. Cost legible in "fiercely ordinary" crumb sacrifice; single deepening suffices for length.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Dominant stake (preserve vows before oblivion) signaled early, but pressure fails to escalate under Accumulative lens—no on-page complication intensifies the task beyond initial setup, rendering the "predecessor failed" reference inert backstory rather than active cost.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.2)
    Stakes tighten relentlessly via sunrise deadline; each thwarted violence (oyster basket, smuggled pistols) visibly wastes time, altering her recording tactics with visceral cost in the horizon's "pale light".

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Dominant stake (understanding carriers) tightens through Aris' sensory escalation (taste shifts). Agency-driven escalation culminates in earned realization, but the cost—emotional shift rather than tangible loss—feels slightly underweighted for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes escalate through protagonist agency: blank sketchbook → lock repair → hidden sketch confrontation. Cost crystallizes in tears tracing "clean paths through dust"—a tangible forfeiture of creative death. Pressure tightens via cave's humming intensifying as she acts, not coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (recovering voices) tightens through Ben’s dishonesty, forcing candor as the only viable tactic. Agency is purely Elara’s—each whispered admission narrows options toward vulnerability. Cost is visceral (wilting) and conceptual (truth requires surrender). "Follow the silent wires" clue deepens stakes without coincidence; pressure coheres under causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    Stakes deepen through Elara’s race against muteness: the sun dipping and snowfall tighten the timeframe, narrowing her window to make the ice "sing." The cost—her throat tightening as the symphony ends—is viscerally felt, though escalation relies more on atmospheric pressure than active protagonist choices beyond the initial placement.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten relentlessly via magnetic shift (live clock), foreclosing escape with dome collapse; cost is visceral (farm reduced to speck), but external pressure slightly overshadows internal conflict escalation in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (healing through listening) tightens via neighbor testimonies, but escalation lacks a tangible cost before closure; pressure coheres yet options narrow too neatly without mid-beat friction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Water rise escalates pressure under Accumulative lens, forcing dance decryption; agency in physical cipher method narrows options, but cost during peak action (knee-deep water) emerges slightly late without prior tactical tradeoffs.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.5)
    Dominant stake (recovering memories) tightens through accumulative escalation: gravity pockets intensify as Aris moves deeper, forcing him to follow coffee patterns to the vortex. Agency drives resolution via journal instructions; conceptual cost (memories transformed not restored) is unmistakable in the chamber's flooded light. No coincidence—methodical search forecloses path of random hope.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.5)
    Stakes ("fractured skies") stay abstract; escalation lacks agency as prophecy hums then dissolves without forcing trade-offs. Sweat and "warmer paper" imply cost but aren't meaningful sacrifices—no tactics altered, no path foreclosed. Pressure resolves through setting (brook flow), not protagonist action.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via protagonist agency: Elara’s sharp question ("Did he ever doubt the language?") forces Mrs. Thorne’s thematic revelation, narrowing her options from demanding literal meaning to accepting "the looking," with the cost of her interrogative approach made legible in her stiffening and burning eyes.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Escalation is driven entirely by Elara's agency under accumulative lens: her calibrated pressure ("infinite pressure, less than a moth's wingbeat") narrows options to a single decisive act. The cost—"too much correction would expose... too little would leave branded"—is visceral and legible in the final weight transformation, making stakes unavoidable.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation driven by Kaela’s agency under Situational lens: Renn’s "blood" revelation deepens stakes into biological truth, narrowing options to progressive disclosure. Cost unmistakable in "elders who’d vanished, echoes erased like footprints."

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (truth vs. crew’s shame) tightens through dream cameos’ escalating revelations, with Elara’s agency driving each deepening. Cost crystallizes in frozen tears during Finn’s piano-wire lighthouse vision, though Oslo student cameo edges toward convenient escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten when Kenji detects the "wrong" water rhythm, escalating to the whistle-induced resonance; pressure grows through protagonist agency under Accumulative lens, but cost (time/ritual effort) feels minor for the profound revelation, limiting higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Lena’s agency: reassembling letters reveals "Sacrifice acceptable" with visceral cost ("orchard’s quiet hum suddenly deafening"). Tightening forecloses naive truth-seeking via conceptual reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten causally when "variant allegiance" reframes the prophet as threat, foreclosing passive observation. Escalation is driven by Elara’s agency (interpreting "seven shadows" message), with cost legible in her shift to sabotage; the sky-cutter’s arrival raises stakes without coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen through sensory accumulation (music box → girl’s hum), but coincidence-driven girl’s arrival slightly undermines protagonist agency in escalation; pressure tightens meaningfully through reweighted sound capture.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven purely by protagonist agency under Accumulative lens: dissonance intensifies ("groaned louder," "shards raining") while Aris adapts via vibrational matching, with cost unmistakable in "slumped against glass" exhaustion as sunset vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.2)
    Stakes tighten through Elara’s moon-path method forcing stillness, but the granary conflict ("children starve") remains abstract; cost is felt in the chain’s sigh yet lacks visceral connection to hunger’s urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes escalate via protagonist agency when footprint evidence forces tactical shift from observation to rebellion; cost legible in "long-dormant part finally breathed free" as conceptual price of integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.6)
    Escalation driven by situational pressure (light shift revealing fracture) under Accumulative lens, narrowing options from "beyond salvage" to repair. Cost is unmistakable in the chaplain's physical reaction to Elias's hidden note, with "deserve" deepening stakes through moral calculus between forgiveness and guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.4)
    Stakes tighten through Zephyr's agency under Accumulative pressure: algorithm iterations deepen to the cruel truth about missing "hunter's hope," narrowing options to embodied yearning, with cost legible in the arrow tip's darkening—a felt price shaping the final redesign.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's agency: tracing numbers to 'VOID' forces Vance confrontation. Cost crystallizes when numbers stop recurring after truth exposure, showing archive's retaliation. Single meaningful deepening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.2)
    Escalation driven entirely by Silas’s agency (mirror navigation, reconstitution), not coincidence, with cost unmistakable in Kael’s visceral shame-to-empathy shift. Dominant stake (empathy vs accusation) tightens through one decisive deepening: the crystal vision reframing the crevasse incident.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Dominant stake (meaning in destined mismatches) tightens through Elara's reflection, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—realization happens *to* her rather than through choices; cost is felt but not earned via action.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Elara's breath-alignment with the parapet's pulse, transforming threat into foundation; visible cost (exhaustion etched around eyes) forecloses easy preservation, crystallizing her stance under accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes escalate through Elara’s agency: giving her photo to Leo narrows options (losing her own artifact) and alters tactics. Cost is legible but secondary pressure (community’s grief) lacks sufficient complication beyond passive witnessing, slightly softening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency—leaning closer triggers accelerated mutations ("dictionary" to "tonary")—with visible cost in the shattering crystal and emotional toll; pressure coheres under Accumulative lens as linguistic density increases toward web-like realization.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    Escalation via density increase: fog thickening, premonition fracturing, and markers becoming "alien" tighten the dominant stake (capturing time’s sound) until the plink’s meaning drains. Cost legible in "meaning drained from it like tide from sand" under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stake (flawless goodbye vs. sterile protocols) tightens via Elara’s agency (rooftop insistence), with cost legible in Aris’s death. Escalation through sensory accumulation meets Accumulative lens demands.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through Hemlock's bone-setting metaphor (one meaningful intensification), but pressure remains internal without tangible escalation; cost legible in dissolved skepticism yet lacks physical manifestation beyond wrist fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen credibly through village fear, but escalation relies on atmospheric accumulation rather than protagonist agency tightening options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (shame vs. connection) tightens when drip pattern mirrors her fractured reputation, forcing the pendant’s redefinition; cost is visceral as she stops hiding it, though viral fallout’s pressure feels slightly abstract post-midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Escalation through cameo density (girl→fisherman→soldier) narrows Elias' options relentlessly; the soldier's dissolving hope forces agency shift with felt cost ("shell’s spiral failing to hold the shape"), deepening stakes via Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten texturally as threads "fray at the edges," narrowing options to the stone’s fragment. Agency-driven deepening succeeds, but cost (the fraying) lacks visible legibility in closure’s resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes crystallize through the eclipse's time pressure narrowing options to one perfect moment; cost is visceral in Elara's physical strain ("fingers trembled only with cold"), but escalation lacks a distinct mid-scene deepening beyond the atmospheric buildup.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.7)
    Stakes feel passive—ritual mechanics drive escalation, not protagonist agency; no trade-offs or narrowing options, though cost ("sinking deep into her bones") is legible under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Dominant stake (containing grief) tightens through carving act. Pressure grows via Accumulative lens: sensory density (sawdust/lion musk) deepens as kettle steam blurs time. Cost visible in "rough but undeniably alive" carving and tear during first cut.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Stakes deepen accumulatively as fragments accrue, narrowing options toward the ritual’s climax, but the "one hundred fragments" rule lacks causal weight—why not ninety-nine? This softens the pressure escalation despite potent emotional payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (abandoned dream) tightens through bear's silent presence forcing stance crystallization. Agency-driven escalation via Elias' micro-choices (lowering oiler) reweights cost visibly in "releasing its ghost" realization.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Elara’s agency: "doubt now gnawed" tightens into dismantling the lie brick by brick. Cost is legible in "shattered illusions" and "peaceful resolve," but the radio’s pressure arrives late, slightly diluting escalation’s causal momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (vanishing knowledge) tightens when spiral knot reveals "deep-rooted endurance," foreclosing ignorance path. Cost ("weight of time") legible in numbing hands and urgency. Agency-driven escalation flawless, though opposition (time) lacks tangible resistance beyond atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Elara’s deepening projection ("summoned Captain Varek... sought the pattern") under accumulative lens; cost legible in shiver and phantom hand, narrowing options to witnessing absence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.3)
    Dominant stake (reviving beauty) tightens via machine activation, but escalation lacks protagonist agency—the hatching feels coincidental, not earned through choices. Cost ("flawed genesis") stated but not viscerally felt through action until final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.9)
    Pressure coheres through Accumulative lens: cloud migration’s shifting shadows deepen the stake (proving scars sing) until harmonic hum forces stance crystallization. Cost is unmistakable—"tears for the lagoon" not father, coin’s pulse as "second heartbeat." Agency drives escalation: her grafting precision enables the hum’s revelation, avoiding coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Stakes tighten via breadcrumb accumulation—each fountain site narrows options toward the Echoes’ urn, with "rush and they tear" raising the ritual’s cost. Elara’s agency drives escalation; her trembling hands and tear-streaked cheeks make the price visceral under Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when sonar pings intensify near desolation ("Will this soil remember life?"). Protagonist agency drives escalation via gear adjustment, with crystallized tears providing unmistakable cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (solitary sorrow vs. collective grief) tighten through accumulative density—each ribbon reconfiguration narrows Silas’s emotional options, culminating in the bowl-shaped cost of tears; escalation driven by protagonist agency (tying ribbons) under Accumulative lens with visible emotional forfeiture.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten through Elias’s agency: tide’s return forces action during pendulum apex. Cost is visceral—the handle’s "microscopic letters" embody years of guilt paid in sweat and memory. Pressure grows via Accumulative lens (sanding rhythm, tidal surge) without coincidence resolving conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes deepen texturally as thread-glyphs reveal layered intentions (regret, resolve, love), narrowing Elara's focus toward the plea for remembrance. Cost legible in "weight of understanding," though escalation lacks overt protagonist-driven narrowing beyond meticulous attention.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation through Elias’s agency—refining probabilities under time pressure ("seven days")—narrows options to the pen’s poised stroke, with cost ("flood villages or deepen freeze") unmistakable and lens-perfect for Accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes escalate through lyrical density accumulation, but broadcast signal strengthening relies on coincidence rather than protagonist agency; visible cost (physical/emotional toll) lands unmistakably at climax, yet escalation lacks causal driver from Elara’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Dominant stake (defying oblivion via fleeting emotion) tightens through ash’s swirling "ghostly embrace," forcing crystallization of Eleanor’s hope. Cost legible in mask’s heaviness—Elara’s endurance forecloses preservation, reconfiguring safety as transient truth under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (preserving tidal knowledge vs. surface myths) tightens when Kael kicks silt into the trench, forcing Phil to present layered evidence.

Agency in stance crystallization forecloses surface dwellers' simplicity with felt conceptual price.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.3)
    Stakes tighten through Ms. Thorne's agency (shifting from singing to silence), but the cost of "unlearning hatred" remains abstract—no concrete loss (e.g., forfeited performance opportunity) alters tactics. Pressure deepens via sensory accumulation but lacks visible price paid.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through her pruning choices—releasing bitter memories to clear space for hope—with visible cost in physical exhaustion; cosmic alignment slightly softens pressure by making the shoot's growth feel convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.0)
    Escalation driven by Elara’s agency: truth compulsion forces the matchbox reveal, narrowing options to "speak or suffer." Cost is visceral—throat tightening—and reshapes tactics as the man runs toward the core. Single tightening suffices masterfully.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency as each house test narrows options (inert yellow cottage → alive bungalow → dying Finnegan), but the absence of secondary character pressure slightly dilutes the dominant stake's interpersonal weight during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully: Aelius’ shift from "rigid certainty" to threading the filament forecloses his prior path. Agency-driven escalation under causal lens; cost legible in "silt settled like forgiveness" as tangible consequence of embracing fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Stakes tighten via density increase: math theorem → rupture → realization that hesitation itself is the texture. Agency drives escalation—Aris's entropy calculation causes rupture, not coincidence. Cost unmistakable: choosing perpetual motion as "boundless hope" forecloses escape with visible emotional price in final descent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Dominant stake (proving kindness lingers) tightens through Accumulative escalation: sensory accumulation (charcoal ink mimicking soot, humidifier sigh) heightens pressure until bus-stop payoff. Cost legible in Elias’s "prickle of doubt" transformed by the woman’s silent recognition—yet moon’s waxing phase lacks causal leverage as live clock.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Thaw-driven escalation narrows options via Elara’s agency (rallying elders), with the visceral cost of melting vaults made legible in "the ancient ice weeping steady streams," tightening stakes through physical consequence rather than abstract dread.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes deepen through tactile pressure (yoyo’s vibration, stone’s chill), but "stepping beyond fate" remains abstract until the branching paths vision; cost is felt via "terrifyingly unwritten" yet could better integrate physical consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant stake (tricking fear) tightens meaningfully when Clara’s confession summons Fear itself. Agency-driven escalation under Hybrid lens: "unbosoming" redefines options with visible cost (Fear’s dissolution = loss of spectral guidance).

    Escalation via Accumulative/Textural lens succeeds—clouds dictating tempo shifts narrow options as the wave looms. But the cost ("splintered driftwood now clattered like wind chimes") feels aestheticized rather than earned; no tangible loss alters Elara's future capacity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through Kael’s agency: correlating whistle note with fractures narrows options to one path. Cost is legible in "dread intensifying" as he grasps the watchers’ waiting—conceptual price shapes his final choice without mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through Elara's agency as she draws parallels, narrowing options to confrontation. Cost legible in "grief... valid but paralysis served no one," with moral calculus sharpening her peak choice to expose patterns rather than assign blame.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen through protagonist agency: "archeologist of abandoned dreams" motivation drives the pry-bar heave, with physical strain ("muscles burning") and emotional cost ("pulse hammering") narrowing options to the cavity discovery; escalation tightens via sea’s resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes (truth vs fabrication) escalate via her methodical ink/pressure analysis; agency drives tightening to single choice (indexing forgeries separately) with felt cost (emotional chill); "dappled resolve" phrasing slightly over-tells tension.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten through protagonist's agency: polishing intensifies sensation until shadow detachment becomes bearable. Cost legible in physical/emotional toll ("knuckles white," soul dragging earth") under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Stakes tighten via cooling period’s live clock forcing perturbation theory use, narrowing options to sensor ghost focus; escalation driven by agency earns cost ("empty ring finger"), but secondary conflict (circuit breakers) lacks interweaving depth.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.9)
    Dominant stake (decoding belonging) escalates through protagonist agency—drone-honed eyes track star trails for precise timing—with cost legible in "hollow victory" past; celestial mechanics narrow options to one split-second choice, avoiding coincidence via skill-based execution.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes deepen organically when the watch hand transforms from hope to proof of complicity; protagonist agency drives the escalation ("thumb caught on groove") with felt cost in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Agency-driven escalation (envoy’s arrival tightening to "now or never") forecloses waiting with visible cost; moon-phase clock makes stakes viscerally felt under Situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.3)
    Regret-driven escalation narrows options to "call or drift," but protagonist passivity until climax weakens agency; utility poles deepen stakes yet lack tangible cost beyond emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes tighten meaningfully when Silas turns right into water, sacrificing speed for moral cost; escalation peaks as the girl's tear reweights the dominant empathy stake with visceral, felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Stakes (reforging bond beyond death) tighten through Elara’s agency in gathering spices; cost is visceral in "sacred theft" and tears, but the fortune cookie’s sudden appearance slightly softens escalation under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)
    Escalation driven entirely by Elara's agency under Accumulative lens: her choice to "embrace the deepest shadow" with love narrows options from haunted vessel to liberation, with cost made undeniable through the drying photographs and her imminent death.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Dominant stake (fetching water) diffuses into prophecy subplot. Detour motivation lacks friction; "risking safety" setup pays off weakly via coincidence (volcano calming), violating Situational pressure rules.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stakes tighten through Kael’s agency: rigid sequences fail, surrender enables vision. Cost is legible in "fleeting understanding," but "hollow ache" lacks concrete physicality to fully maximize emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    Single dominant stake (decipher treaty mid-duel) tightens relentlessly via spatial constraints. Cost is legible when Silas sacrifices defense to align with seventh hole—but "diplomatically fierce" motivation lacks sufficient friction during Vorlag's attack.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dominant stake (spreading resistance) tightens as verse shifts from "hiding" to "call to rebuild... in action." Agency in scattering papers forecloses passive resistance with visible cost (vulnerability to authorities). Pressure coheres via city's tension vibrating through beams under accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Horizon's darkening creates relentless causal pressure narrowing options; cost legible in Elara's race against light with visible trade-offs in musical intervention.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.2)
    Monsoon deadline escalates pressure through protagonist agency (testing pitch, guiding song); cost is unmistakable as "luminous doubt persisted" amid restored memory’s physical anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Stakes tighten through Kai's agency: tugging the thread transforms passive remembrance into active seeking, narrowing options to endurance. The cost—daily tending as apology—charges the final image, but the severance's cause (pride over warning son-in-law) lacks sufficient escalation pressure in the present scene.
