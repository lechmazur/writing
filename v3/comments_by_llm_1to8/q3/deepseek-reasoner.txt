The environment directly constrains and enables the story's central action, charging the final image with meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.4)
    The setting is a significant strength, moving from a "kaleidoscopic waterfall" to an orchard of "cybernetic blossoms and decaying data." Far from being a mere backdrop, the environment is the central puzzle; the wall must be decoded, the throne understood as a landmark, and the vortex traversed. The setting constrains and defines every key action, directly charging the final image of a new vantage point between galaxies, meeting the 9+ standard with ease.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.6)
    The setting is not merely a backdrop; it is an active agent in the story’s conflict and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is exceptional because it is not a backdrop but the primary tool and obstacle. The "massive, petrified harp formed by the gorge’s singular wind-sculpted rock formations" is a brilliant, specific, and memorable invention that is absolutely central to the plot's mechanics. Removing this exact setting would not just change the story's flavor; it would break its entire causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.5)
    Exceptional. The setting is not a backdrop but an active participant in the character's psychological journey.

This environment directly constrains and enables the character's actions, and its transformation is the core of the story's resolution, charging the final image with immense power.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is a standout achievement, both evocative and integral to the plot. Concepts like the "shimmering, auroral curtain" of visible time and the "Palace of Reflected Hours" are masterfully realized. Crucially, the setting constrains choice (covering the mirrors during the storm) and the key object—the shard—becomes a micro-setting in itself, its fractured light charging the climactic scene and final image. This is a model of how setting can be an active agent in the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The "Resonance Chamber" is a highly atmospheric and original setting, though its specific acoustic properties are more asserted than dramatized. However, the story excels at the micro-setting level: the workbench, the music box, and especially the philosopher's stone chip are not mere props but active tools that constrain choice and charge the final image. The final moment, where light spills from the box to push back the workshop's shadows, is a superb integration of object and environment.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest element. The archway is not mere backdrop; it's an active force that constrains choice (providing shelter), drives the plot (as a temporal nexus), and provides the subject for the resonant final image (the sculpture). The transformation from a "monstrous maw" to a sacred space is powerfully rendered through specific, purposeful sensory details like the "turbine-hum reverie."

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is rendered with exquisite, purposeful detail, particularly the cathedral window and the quality of light. The environment directly constrains character action, as when the violet light singles out the specific flagstone. The score is lowered due to the temporal inconsistency introduced in the final paragraph, which damages the otherwise coherent world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.5)
    The settings are exceptional, serving as far more than backdrop. The sterile, pressurized silence of the zeppelin contrasts sharply with the elemental power of the beach.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is superb, functioning as a catalyst for the entire plot. The "windblown sanctuary" and its specific contents—the broken lever and the disused cathedral bell rope—don't just provide atmosphere; they directly constrain Elara's choices and supply the very tools for both the physical and thematic conflict. The final image of the unused rope is powerfully charged by its context within this specific, isolated setting.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.5)
    The setting is superb, functioning as both atmosphere and a crucial narrative instrument. The initial description of the silence and oppressive heat creates a palpable mood, which is then perfectly broken by the breeze and scent. The lighthouse itself is more than a backdrop; its components—the Fresnel lens and the rotating mechanism—are integral to the plot, and the specific detail of it being a "cobalt" lighthouse provides a brilliant, resonant payoff in the final image of the cobalt beam. The setting directly constrains and enables the story's closure.

    The “cathedral of crystal shadows” functions as crucible, every glass pane and phantom scent constraining the ultraviolet apparatus and the final release of perfume. Details are selective and biased by Elara’s profession—“a library of forgotten scents”—anchoring tone and choice simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terra-cotta grotto’s cool clay and starlit mouth constrain movement and echo the rope’s texture; the orange stone pedestal literally supports the choice moment. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael’s poetic bias. The setting charges the final image when the grotto reverts to “just a cave,” marking the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sunken greenhouse and shipwreck graveyard are rendered with tactile specificity (“curved glass,” “rusted crown”) and constrain every move—entry route, air thickness, acoustic properties. The pear itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The amber grotto’s honey light and crystalline ceiling filter every move; the blotter petal and silver tools act as micro-setting that constrains Elara’s sterile technique and later absorbs the empathic overload. Sensory selection is POV-driven and purposeful, though the wider world beyond the grotto is necessarily absent.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    Seaside night, cobblestones, and the star-vaulted library are sharply evoked and filter through Elara’s mood. The library’s open-air upper floor constrains the final conversation (fluttering pages, wind), charging the closure image. Economy is good; no exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Crystalline orchard is tactile—glinting fruit, crater rim—its space channels gatherings and reagents (moss-wash). Micro-obsidian’s sharp edge repurposed as living canvas forces spatial choreography and final image, constraining final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Glass canal, frozen clock face, and the pendant-as-tool all constrain tactics and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy mirrors Elara’s illustrator bias—color, texture, light—while the giant’s breathing keeps time tactile. Spatial choreography is flawless: climb, sphere, moth alighting. One decimal off perfection only because the city’s social context is hinted but not leveraged for micro-choice.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cavern orchard, dripping stalactites, and chipped mosaic constrain every move: the water feeds memory, the mosaic records it, and the stone’s fractures literally guide the magical energy; the final image recharges these details as living archive, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The library’s blue-lit shadows, pipe chases, and radiator depths physically shape tactics—only he can reach the niches. Dust, gloom, and humming HVAC supply sensory immediacy and mood modulation; the tape reel’s cold, curled metal acts as micro-setting that constrains his ancient reader. No spatial incoherence.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    The mossy trellis, linden branch, and dripping leaves are not backdrop but active constraints: the fallen branch becomes the new support, the wet moss guides her fingers. Sensory hierarchy is character-true—botanist’s eye for hydrotropism, tactile attention to soil and vine. Final image of the drying leaf recharges the opening storm, locking setting to theme.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    Crashing rain, brackish sea-stink, and crumbling shale are filtered through Elara’s painterly eye, narrowing perception under pressure. The cottage worktable and the warm amber brooch act as micro-settings that constrain her final act. Weather actively reshapes the cliff and exposes the brooch, integrating environment with plot. Final image reuses the cliff’s “weeping” motif, now reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    The geode-cave’s sonic shadows constrain the ritual placement of the pearl and charge the final image. Sensory specificity is selective and purposeful; the “musical crystal” evolves from ominous to contented, mirroring the thematic turn.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.9)
    Ivory Harbor’s rain-washed quays and the half-repaired library’s “missing teeth” anchor place and mood. The valve functions as micro-setting, its cold brass constraining her grip and later re-weighted in the final image. Selective sensory detail (salt-sting, dripping water) filters through Elara’s archivist priorities without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    The moss-grown arch and starlit vault are not mere scenery; the vault’s pressure and the pedestal’s placement force the final choice. Sensory detail is selective—mist, cold, nebulae—filtered through Elara’s cartographer eye, and the setting’s scale dwarfs her, charging the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tower’s broken circle and whale-song acoustics constrain Elara’s solitude and later her act of listening; the tile’s warmth and weight function as micro-setting that shapes every choice. Sensory detail is selective—salt taste, cold stone, ceramic heat—filtered through her skeptical attention. Final image reuses the open sky and whale chorus to charge the closure. One minor spatial vagueness: exact distance to cliff edge never pinned, but it never affects tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prismatic escondite, the fragment, and the cobalt-magenta vortex are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice: the walls’ shimmer becomes the very geometry that rebels, forcing her decision. Micro-setting (the fragment against her skin) functions as setting-object hybrid. Final image of the now-silent fragment on the shelf recharges earlier motifs. Only a hairline slip—one generic “shimmering walls” echo—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Few descriptive lines, each is filtered obsessionally through Elara’s eyes. The sterile prep room, violet ink pulse, and cold steel table form a micro-setting that constrains every move; no expository drift.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    The bonsai labyrinth and buzzing lamp are rendered with tactile economy; the lamp’s hum and pale glow physically constrain her attention and later become the conduit for revelation, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The container labyrinth is tactile and atmospheric—“steel walls groaning as if breathing”—and the tide rhythm functions as a live clock that gates K’s movements. The arsenic label itself becomes a micro-setting that constrains K’s perception and ultimately charges the final image of containers as “silent witnesses.”

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observatory’s “skeleton dome” and grit-covered stone constrain movement and acoustics; the half-finished cello itself becomes micro-setting that shapes every choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—dust motes, bruised twilight, bone-felt bass note. One missed beat: cliff location is named but never exploited for wind, drop, or vertigo pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    The raft-city is evoked through motion and sound—“canal of murky water between rafts decked with blinking lights”—and the stone functions as micro-setting that constrains choice. Spatial choreography is clean: Hem’s old stall → new nook → mural behind it. The environment guides tactics; sunnier corner “better for whittling” is a concrete constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    The moonlit summit’s vacuum silence, plummeting cold, and basalt stone constrain Elara’s endurance and camera use; the grain itself becomes micro-setting that triggers the climax. Sensory selection is filtered through her professional priorities—dust, star patterns, heater whine—without tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mist-coated depot is evoked through sound, temperature, and the wet slap of anxious footsteps; the ceramic bowl of water becomes a micro-setting that literally reframes the drone’s failure. Spatial choreography is clean—bench, lamp, bowl, open door track without drift. The environment constrains choice: the anchor horn’s deadline is audible pressure. One more sensory detail tethered to Elara’s blindness (e.g., echo-location off the iron ribs) would have nudged 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.5)
    The rusted outpost and obsidian lake actively pressure choices and supply the visual closure; the condensation glass and frozen city act as charged micro-settings.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is filtered through Elara’s body and tools; cobblestones, archway, and tuning fork constrain her choices and charge the final image. Wildflowers and moss are selective, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is coherent; distances track. The archway’s hum and the shutter’s creak integrate sensory detail with action. Environment evolves causally with each small repair.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.9)
    Temple stones “fur[ring]…bioluminescent blue,” statues “smoothed by millennia” and the sphere “shimmering sphere of nothingness” are vivid, specific, and tethered: every setting detail constrains choice—silenced movement, limited oxygen clock. Vial’s bird stopper reconfigures in final image, satisfying Gate 3+.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Environment is vivid and selective: “glass cage,” “coppery glow,” “jagged reef.” The lighthouse itself constrains movement and frames the final choice; the lattice becomes micro-setting that channels the climax. Spatial choreography is clean; only the coppery hue edges toward overused gothic palette.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.5)
    Silver-barked equation-trees and black silent snow root the dream-logic immediately; the greenhouse itself tightens choice by constraining cultivation methods. One minor overreach—“endless night” drifts slightly generic compared to “softly glowing, crystalline equations”—but otherwise selects sensory detail surgically.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.0)
    The red canyon walls, salt-grass dust, and starlit copper plate are not backdrop; their grit literally passes through the needle and into the seam, so environment constrains and enables the final repair. Micro-setting (the fissure’s lip, the plate’s etched channels) is handled in motion as she kneels and stitches. Sensory hierarchy follows Elara’s wharf-trained eye: texture first, then sound of water. No static postcarding; every descriptor feeds the sewing action or the eventual trickle.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful—roots “cradling ancient skulls,” scent of “damp earth and blooming orange trees.” The sundial stone constrains her final choice and charges the closing image. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room syndrome. One notch below 8.8 because the broader island geography remains impressionistic.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arcade’s vaulted hush and gilded columns are filtered through Kael’s synesthetic bias—sound as ghost-whispers, light as liquid gold—until the mosaic tiles underfoot literally become the decoding surface. The setting constrains the final choice: only the dawn angle of light makes the chalk numbers usable, charging the mailbox image with transient urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Cobalt Observatory’s rust-gold decay and the candle’s cold light constrain choices: the former isolates Elara, the latter enables hidden-thread reading. Micro-setting (workbench, gate) tracks spatially; no impossible positions. Weather (“autumn had painted”) mirrors internal tension without overt symbolism. Tool-as-setting (tapestry) literally becomes the city map that alters tactics. One anachronism risk—“weaponized asteroid” feels SF in ostensibly low-tech world—but the Astrologer’s sky-editing justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    Mangrove arch, tea-dark water, moonlit bark do more than paint—they become ritual apparatus: root arch is literal altar, leaf the page for condensation. Sensory anchors constrain every movement and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Mist, twilight, sterile hospital light create tactile pressure; the coral and plaster cast function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Final image reweights the coral from charm to promise. One minor redundancy: “mist-clad space” / “misty atrium.”

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ruined orchard is not backdrop; its skeletal trees and diffused light literally become Elara’s pigment. The fresco fragment and fog function as micro-setting that constrains every placement of film strips. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: damp earth under knees, sun-warm apricot memory. Final image of prismatic droplets re-uses the fog as collaborator, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.3)
    The sonic garden is rendered through tactile sound and brass flora; the fountain-lotus constrains the climax, its petals literally tuning the outcome. Selective sensory detail (hum, fracture, chord) keeps the space alive without cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse’s humid jungle and drone’s red blink constrain tactics—Lysander learns the rattle here, later returns to send the hawk-shadow signal. Gardens shift from safe grid to trap, then to untraceable proliferation; setting actively shapes choices. Sensory detail is selective—chlorophyll stains, spectral green light—filtered through Lysander’s urgency. Micro-setting (gourd rattle as tool) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shell’s nacre walls and bioluminescent light constrain Elara’s posture and echo her internal state. The postcard’s final pulse recharges the nebula image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.6)
    The opal shelved clouds, crystal ghost-flowers, and fracturing wind-tool each press tactics: the setting’s frost altitude demands the humming body itself become a resonator, charging the final image when the last petal sighs. Sensory detail is curated rather than exhaustive, always filtering through Elara’s selective attention under low light.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    Archive is rendered through selective sensory cues—dust motes in starlight, towering shelves leaning inward—each filtered by Elara’s urgency. The glass ink well doubles as micro-setting, its mercurial gleam guiding her hand and later glowing with spent warmth. Spatial choreography is clean; the room’s silence amplifies the internal hum. Environment constrains choice: only here, only now, before dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    The volcano’s breathing rhythm and the chain’s tactile feedback constrain every tactical choice; the crumbling amphitheater is not backdrop but pressure source. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through Elara’s professional eye. Final hum recharges the opening sigh, locking environment to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    The attic’s dust motes under the skylight function as micro-setting that constrains her meditation and later recharges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—decaying paper, cold stone—filtered through her courier’s precision. The bookshop itself is sketched just enough to anchor space without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The corn-maze-turned-energy-labyrinth, the prism terrace, and the farmhouse interior are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice—e.g., the terrace’s crystalline surface becomes the literal map. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms. The “fractured hush” atmosphere modulates with pressure. Could edge higher if the terrace’s physical rules were even more tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.2)
    “Pressurized labyrinth of hums and shadows” and the ionized barrier give tactile limits; the platform’s spatial logic is clear. The deep’s black dome and the fireflies’ “lazy, luminous scripts” mirror Elara’s internal shift. Setting constrains choice—she cannot leave—yet gifts the fireflies as resource, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The iridescent geode and crater glass function as micro-setting that constrains every beat: the glass translates emotion, the cave refracts light to mirror Elara’s shifting stance. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The seedling at the entrance charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    The tidal arcade’s salt-tinged hush, sodium glare, and dormant rides set an atmospheric shell, yet the board itself—not the arcade—generates constraint. Micro-setting works when pieces scratch cobblestones or speakers thrum beneath the table, but larger pier geography stays vague. Meets adequacy for 600w space yet lacks the 9-gate constraint via environment.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.9)
    Garden, moonstone, and her own arm function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only twilight yields usable light, only one speck of pigment remains. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. Final image of glowing arm against mist charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    Pearl Bay’s dawn mist and the prism atrium are rendered with selective, purposeful detail; the glass lens physically refracts the earlier water rings, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent, though the jetty-to-workshop transition is compressed rather than staged.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    The moonlit ridge, cold ash scent, and granite’s retained warmth anchor place and mood. The porcelain box operates as micro-setting that constrains her gesture. Sensory selection is filtered through firefighter priorities—smoke, ash, cool porcelain. Environment subtly guides the final release of ashes to the wind.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.8)
    “Tide-polished grotto” is sharply sensuous; echoing drip synchronizes with the gauge twitch, environment guiding choice. Yet grotto never physically constrains her path—spatial grip could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    Atmosphere is ivy-eaten decay filtered through Elara’s “corridor echo” lens: “dappled green” and “silent, still” air narrow her perception to acoustics. The hearth diaries and mantel cracks anchor the room and later guide the acoustic hunt; setting acts as tool. Final image “world before the shifts” via negative gives charged specificity but stops just short of constraining a fresh choice.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prism parapet and rain-beaded spires are not backdrop; they literally supply the pigment and conduit for the climax. Micro-setting (terrace stones, wet blossoms) constrains footing and scent, guiding Elara’s slow dance. Final mirror image recharges the parapet’s earlier spectrum. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terrace’s warm flagstones and the valley’s “patchwork of vibrant new growth” anchor place and mood; the twin suns function as a live clock that constrains the final choice. Micro-setting—the clipboard’s constellations—becomes the decisive tool. One minor drift: “ancient terrace” could be any terrace without a sharper sensory cue.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt flat is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic properties and crack-map guide every step and final placement of the egg. Sensory selection is urgent—dust on trousers, thunder lull narrowing perception. The setting constrains the choice of release point and charges the final image when the rain begins to erase the map. One hairline slip: “town shimmering on the far edge” is slightly postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The silver courtyard under snow is rendered with selective sensory detail that mirrors Elara’s isolation; moonlit snow becomes blank verse. The prism sanctuary, though off-stage, is evoked through refracted color and crystalline song, charging the final image. Environment constrains choice only implicitly; the snow is backdrop more than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Radar dome’s skeletal ribs and meteor-quiet function as micro-setting that literally arches over the decision; stick’s tactile carvings constrain her pivot. Sensory hierarchy obeys calligrapher’s eye—ink, line, texture—filtering the Cold-War relic through her urbane bias. Final image of city lights “fallen constellation” reprises sky motif, charging the pamphlet choice with cosmic scale.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Verdant grotto, cloudlight, and mossy stone are never backdrop—they compress distance, throttle movement, and determine how slowly Elara can kneel to free the wing. The setting itself supplies the thicket trap and the silk stem anchor, charging the closure image with micro-geography that matters to the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    The icebound sanctum, aurora light, and casting tools constrain every move; heat versus cold becomes tactical. The reconfigured rope itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vine-draped bunker as micro-metropolis, roots cracking silver foundations literalized inside Foresight’s dream-body-city; this constrains her choice to hatch (egg metaphor). Rewilded forest and storm charge final image. Sensory compression matches AI perception: dust, grit, silence-of-light from wafer seal.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Palace shadows and ochre light filter through Kalanu’s astronomer gaze; the tile’s cool weight and glowing lattice constrain his final choice. Micro-setting (tile as cage) charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective, never ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    The soundless sanctuary is vivid—dust motes drift without a whisper, stained glass now a nebula. The micro-setting (library rotunda) constrains the encounter to intimate stillness, amplifying every breath. Sensory selection is biased by Elara’s pacifist attention to silence and Kael’s tactile grip on the cylinder. The shifting city is kept off-stage, but the window’s metamorphosis charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fog, frost, and skeletal trees constrain movement and perception; the orchard’s haze literally limits how close she can get before the ritual. The broken sextant and mirror act as micro-settings that shape posture and breath. Final image of glowing blossoms re-uses initial descriptors with reweighted meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Orchard canopy and shattered window anchor who/where early; cathedral interior offers tactile access and light palette for the finale rainbow. Environment serves tactical use: rafters as workshop, stone as grinder. Scale of description is selective and purposeful. One prop (quartz shard) constrains the final choice, satisfying the 9+ micro-setting gate.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    The crystalline orchard is selective, sensory, and purposeful; its wrongness constrains Elara’s hesitation and later choice. Micro-setting (gazebo of woven light) provides the only unobserved space, directly enabling the epiphany. Final image—the fruit’s nebula-light flowing through her—charges the closure. One minor spatial blur: “petrified root” could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mountain-bookstore is atmospheric and specific—“shifting pages and settling dust” filters through Elara’s perception. Micro-setting (crumbling alcove, ozone breeze) constrains her search and later enables the corridor. Spatial choreography is coherent; no floating rooms. Final image of shadow-and-starlight shelves charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ship-as-mind micro-setting constrains every move: rotting boards, salt-rot, silent carousels mirror fractured identity. Fog and dusk narrow perception in real time, guiding Elara to the bow. Final bedroom reveal re-uses the emerald card as charged object, satisfying 9+ gate. Selective sensory detail never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clock-tower mechanism room is vivid, selective, and constrains choice: cool air preserves parchment, ticking metronomes her methodical pace, and the impossible door’s shimmer is spatially coherent. Micro-setting (rope knot) functions as charged object. No slips touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.9)
    The harmonic caves are not backdrop but instrument: their “soft, resonant songs” become the stake, their silence the antagonist. Micro-setting (ice patterns, still pool) constrains her method and charges the final image. Sensory specificity is selective—cold solidity, static hum in teeth, silver constellation of cracks—always filtered through her trained perception. The energy beings’ shift from invasive hum to “respectful bass note” shows causal environmental evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.7)
    Observatory, crystal stones, and solidified fog are vividly selective and constrain choice: only platform exists, edge is fatal, crystals dictate in which direction regret travels. Final image of “infinite star-dusted blackness” above and “perfect, silent sea” below charges the ending, re-weighting the observatory as the last intact human realm.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    Setting is filtered through Elara’s artisan perception—cloying mortar, vaulted ceiling, “starless black.” The Blooming Fortress functions as an architectural lung: its stone petals receive luminous rain that reweights the ending’s air. Micro-setting is tactile, but fortress-scale geography remains lightly sketched; thus short of the 9+ gate requiring constraint to final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto’s bioluminescent walls and mirrored pool constrain the choice to look into possible futures; the jade cicada itself functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (“smelled of deep water and wet quartz”). One minor spatial hiccup: the flashlight sweep feels disembodied for a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The xenial trellis is vivid, selective, and immediately tied to Elara’s anti-bunker desire for open air. Micro-setting (porcelain doll) constrains her grip and later becomes the site of transformation. Sensory detail is filtered through claustrophobic bias: “smooth, concrete walls” vs. “sun-drenched emptiness.” Only minor drift: “planetary core” as ceiling is briefly disorienting before inversion rule is accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Canals, drifting terrace, and storm glass are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains choice: the terrace’s glass absorbs sound, enabling the final crystallization.

    Setting is selective and purposeful: the “auric lagoon” constrains movement and charges the final image with toxic beauty. Micro-setting (phone booth base panel) functions as lock for the key. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Weather (spring shower) creates the puddle map, directly shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prism atrium is not backdrop but instrument: its facets refract doom, its mist drinks sound. Dewdrops act as micro-lenses warping perception, directly constraining the timing of the harmonic counter-attack. Spatial choreography is flawless; the grotto breathes with the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ashen arbor is evoked with selective sensory strokes—“gnarled living wood,” “veins of silver and gold”—and the workbench-as-micro-setting constrains the final act. Spatial anchors are present early; the sky’s transformation is legible and causally tied to the seeding.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ash-fields mill to glass-shard greenhouse; subterranean roar and mist charge all five senses with latent fertility. Waterfall’s spray, sound vibration, and fertile soil in jar physically enable her shift to planter. Spatial choreography clean: grate, tunnel, curtain of water. Environment not backdrop—it offers the new medium the compass senses.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rain-washed foundry is rendered through selective sensory detail—wet ash, cold iron, dripping roof—filtered by Elara’s alchemical priorities.

Final image of creeping green ceiling literalizes the organic network she’s grown, charging the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is not postcard forest—it is ultrasonic, bone-resonant, and literally acts on Elara’s sensorium: “the forest around her did not rustle; it hissed…hollows of her bones.” Sensory specificity constrains her only viable sense (touch), turning physical environment into tactical resource. Final ring/monolith micro-setting supplies the closure constraint. Only small deduction: momentary tourist phrasing “great dance” for constellations is slightly generic, not character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    The station’s flicker, gravitational “humming,” and the anomaly’s distortions are vivid and selective. The pen’s cool barrel and the console’s click anchor the final action. Environment constrains the climax: only the anomaly’s shear allows the message storage and the pen’s calibration.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Moonlit harbor is not backdrop; its “luminous path” becomes the staff on which she writes her score. The camera’s brass and the groaning pier supply tactile constraints. Final image of dawn light recharges the opening moonlight, reweighted by loss.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    Glass dome, perfumed air, and grit under boots function as micro-setting that directly alters tactics: the climate-controlled calm dissuades violence the way a weapon-free zone would outside. The rose itself becomes a tactile proxy for a new rule-set. One minor drift—“shimmering, silent haze outside” is atmospheric but not tied to consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The sound wave garden is not backdrop but active antagonist: blossoms shatter under wrong steps, violet fog thickens resistance, and the final tonal shift confirms the setting’s agency. Spatial choreography is exact; the rail spike’s final warmth charges the image.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    The observatory’s echoing dome and brass telescope are vivid and thematically apt, but they serve more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint until the final image. The rosewood pen functions as micro-setting/object and does constrain choice, nudging toward the 9-band gate, yet the larger environment could be swapped without breaking the arc. Strong specificity, slightly under-leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The amber warehouse’s honey-lit dust and the hourglass frames are not backdrop; they constrain movement and supply the literal mechanism that must be flipped. The setting’s silence and color charge the final image when light floods upward.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.6)
    Mist-soaked fir, unstable cornice, and the silver hush create immediate pressure on movement and visibility; body-as-micro-setting when numb fingers fumble the box. Setting constrains every step onto the cornice, charging the retrieval beat.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gutter, fog, and river-bank are filtered through Elius’s biased attentiveness; the final kneel by the water uses setting as both altar and threshold, charging the closing image, yet the hills themselves remain slightly silhouettes rather than tactile constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    The red dust, bleached hives, stubborn lavender, and lantern glass are not backdrop but instruments: the glass constrains perception, the clay records memory, the kiln smoke marks time.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fire-escape micro-setting, moonlit harbor, and the gauge-tooth all constrain choices and co-create the final image. Harbor reflection prefigures the splintered starlight that later hits the wall, turning setting into active collaborator rather than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tidal library is not backdrop; its breathing corridors and atomically reflective walls actively channel light onto the sundial, enabling the final ignition. Micro-setting (brass warming under focused photons) constrains the decisive beat. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. One anachronistic flicker—“atomically reflective” feels like physics lecture, not lived perception.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lotus pond and temple function as a palpable, mirrored constraint; the pier serves as stage for communal witnessing. Micro-setting—rain-dark planks, candlelit vellum shadows—charges the final image. Minor drift: spatial relationship between pedestal and temple could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    The radio-station office is sketched with selective sensory anchors—flickering lights, subsonic thrum through floorboards—that constrain her tactics and charge the final silence. Charts evolve from maps of stars to “ancient history,” reweighting the setting itself.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    The star-ceiling, spherical prison, and crystal lens are not backdrop but instruments: the false constellations focus through the lens to project the map, directly enabling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The quarry’s “bowl of furrowed hush” and coiling mist act as pressure vessel; the ribbon fragment becomes micro-setting that constrains her reconstruction. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful. The final ray of sun striking the wall recharges the opening image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.3)
    The station’s “overgrown sensor arrays,” headstone’s “verdigris light,” and stagnant air constrain Elara’s movements and mood. Specificity in spatial choreography and object handling remains coherent, tracking nail and spade with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Quartz arbor functions as living character: mist transduces sound, crystals’ violet core reframes human rage as planetary memory. Micro-choice—leaning against wounded tree—constrained by its glowing hollow. Late-night driveway passage is atmospheric engine, not set dressing. Specificity over breadth: one grove, two shards (car, tree).

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard and loom are not backdrop but instruments: the “perpetual green twilight” feeds the silence she harvests, and the loom itself becomes the map that must be broken. Micro-setting (amber bead as fossilized moment) constrains her final choice. A hairline slip: “gnarled fruit trees struggled” is generic amid otherwise precise imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard planet’s dying soil and floating rock arches frame the stakes early; the mine’s crystalline dome and fissure of sky become micro-settings that constrain tactics and charge the final image of “blue defiance,” satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    Micro-setting of repair bay and the shard itself constrain choices (shard’s warmth limits further jumps). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: “phantom scent of ozone,” “echo of long-silent alarm.” Dockyard silence and derelict hulls are tactile; final shift to same bay with living regret reweights the backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lantern room’s cold brass, moaning wind, and stacked stones are filtered through Elvan’s wary gaze, constraining his decision to relight the lamp. The sea glass on the sill reappears in the final image, charging the closure with spectral continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    The Emerald Lighthouse, the glass lens, and the reef-shadow channel are not backdrop but tactical terrain; the beam’s total internal reflection and the hidden channel constrain Silas’s final choice, charging the ending with physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea house and valley mist are not postcard backdrops; the suspended silence and filtered sun literally enable the dye master’s sun-trail method, constraining how the climax can unfold. Micro-setting (wing as sky-fragment) charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective sensory detail—“mossy stones,” “ozone,” “violent flashes”—grounds the labyrinth and tower without catalog bloat. The sextant itself becomes micro-setting, its brass gleam constraining the final choice. Weather and moonlight are not backdrop but causal agents. One hedge: the western quadrant remains a vague spatial marker.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Crystalline orchard pressures every decision (resource scarcity, memory threads as tools); closing blanket of light is charged by its constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    Library’s “listening silence” and moon-framed window are selective, atmospheric, and directly constrain tactics (she must become silence to survive). Café-bank arch is a fresh spatial paradox that gates the scene. One notch from 9+ only because the plaza exterior is sketched more generically.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    The overgrown courtyard tea house is not mere backdrop; its wildness supplies the saved seeds and hidden space that enable the guerrilla gardening. The sterile concrete wall at the ex-bakery site constrains where the first seed can be planted, making the act a deliberate transgression. Sensory selection is biased through Elara’s grief-tuned perception: “silent, pale gray” sky, “gritty, fragrant dust.” The final calendula flower recharges the opening emptiness.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen library is tactile and selective—quartz hush, frost-veined floor—yet it never physically constrains his choices; it remains atmospheric rather than instrumental to the final turn.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rotting-pier market is vivid, selective, and filtered through Elara’s practiced eye; salt/decay/whispers anchor atmosphere without catalog. The fob functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice, but the broader environment could have pressed one more tactical limit to reach 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lavender bluff and aurora are not mere backdrop; their scent and light are siphoned into the compass, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography is clean; the ring’s warmth and the bending lavender track. Micro-setting (ring, taste) functions as setting and charges closure. One hairline slip: “lavender around them bent” could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    The mildewed library and luminous crystal cave are filtered through Elara’s painterly perception; the “auroral sorrow” light constrains her final act by supplying both overwhelming stimulus and raw material. Spatial choreography is clean: door groans, staircase descends, canvas lifted. Sensory selection narrows under crisis—charcoal smudge, cold brass, resonant hum—supporting urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Glass-latticed Veridia, the brass scent of decay, the zinc fragment’s tactile chill—details are selective, bias-filtered, and culminate in the Aviary’s skeletal avians charged by the final glow; one setting element constrains the choice.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The kinetic sculpture functions as character, tool, and setting—its icy shell must be broken for Elara to access sound; the whispering bluff’s altitude constrains time and wind, directly governing the melt timeline.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Glass dome, metallic roses, and fossilized-heart box are specific and constraining; the box becomes the literal ignition key, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail is selective and urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    Courtyard is tactile—terracotta tiles, olive leaves, ivy-draped niche—yet never ornamental; the eastern arch’s shadow literally guides the search. Micro-setting (mailbox niche) constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy favors curator’s curator-eye detail over tourist catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken dome’s groaning pressure and brass lock are tactile and constraining; the die glows as final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and sound over sight, matching urgency. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from grating to vault to rising water. Environment directly forces the climax—structural failure after the die is taken.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    The salt chamber’s “gleaming silence” and fluctuating gravity physically constrain Silas’s crawl and final stance. Dockside hiss and lantern hiss echo later in the chamber’s hum, knitting setting to theme. One more sensory tether inside the crystals (taste of brine?) would have nudged 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Brook, moss, willow, and paper wing are tactile micro-settings that constrain the summoner’s method; the wing’s final ascent charges the cosmic closure. Sensory selection is purposeful and POV-filtered; no orientation drift. One notch below 9+ only because the environment does not actively resist him—constraint is more conceptual than physical.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rooftop garden’s living soil and meteor-lit parapet act as micro-setting that constrains the final choice; the seal must meet stone here, now, under falling stars, making place inseparable from the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    The velvet garden is no decorative backdrop; the night-blooming jasmine, tide salt, and failing starlight all constrain her workspace and signal elapsed time. Micro-setting (the shell, tuning forks) doubles as tool and setting, literally vibrating against her ribs to guide pacing. No drift in spatial or temporal anchors. Environment guides choices—she must finish “before the last star fades”—without scenic bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and dripping stalactites are not backdrop; the chill stone bench steels her resolve, the shifting light foreshadows revelation, and the drip cadences her patience. The rose thorn and vellum function as micro-settings that constrain every move. Final image: pearl-grey aurora recharges the opening jade-and-violet veil, now morally recolored. Only the brief “ancient wrong” lacks tactile grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    The canyon’s night inversion, the seashell’s alien pearlescence, and the star-kissed arch all constrain Lyra’s path and charge the final image; spatial choreography is precise, and sensory selection mirrors her narrowing focus.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Glacier shrine’s cold actively constrains Elara’s breath and posture; the melted globe’s warped glass becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy (ice-light, pluming breath, fused plastic) is filtered through her professional eye. One beat of spatial vagueness—“alone in the quiet ice”—keeps it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet’s wet stone, prismatic droplets, and mist-soaked pines are filtered through Hideo’s net-mender gaze; every sensory note serves the thematic weave. The bamboo whisk and moonlit moss constrain his posture and ritual, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the parapet edge) literally shapes the firefly circle’s geometry. A touch more tactile interaction with the stone could have nudged it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard’s shimmer and vitrified soil are rendered through Kaelen’s skeptical gaze, constraining every choice: the diamond’s cold weight, the dust under fingernails, the grating metal panel. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure—first the visual flicker, then tactile cold, finally the hum in the bones. The setting evolves from lush mirage to dead husk in lockstep with plot. One minor slip: “ochre haze” repeats twice without new inflection.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stormlit observatory and cobalt portico are not backdrop; the portico refracts lightning and later becomes the metaphorical lens Elara rejects. Weather and architecture constrain every move—equipment grounded in copper veins, glass fracturing light. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through her fatigue.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drift-ice marina is vivid, selective, and causally active: grinding floes dictate urgency, frost-rimed pylons ground spatial choreography. The lighthouse lens and key function as micro-setting objects that constrain tuning choices. Final golden light recharges opening sunset, crystallizing transience. No static cataloging; every detail either pressures or mirrors Elara’s arc.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vivid, selective details (basalt chamber, ice-glint, lodestone hum) consistently constrain choices: the iron viaduct literally pulls his metal boots, anchoring the final decision. The micro-setting of the magnetic viaduct becomes the final image that reconfigures the horizon; lake and rock function as one mutable frame rather than ornamental postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    Subway tunnel’s damp gravel, rust, and culvert topography constrain every move; lantern’s placement at the dry streambed charges the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful; drought residue tightens stakes without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.3)
    Antique shop is rendered through scent, dust, ticking, and prismatic light; every detail either pressures Eli’s guilt or enables the epiphany. The heart itself becomes micro-setting that constrains choice (only one key, one winding). Light mechanics are physically plausible and thematically charged. No spatial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    The acid sea and floating workshop constrain every move; the brass disk’s final schematic is charged by the corrosive environment. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. Spatial anchors are clear by line 3; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.9)
    The humming server cavern and derelict warehouse are sketched with selective sensory detail that guides Elara’s choices. The patch’s velvet and vibrant thread act as micro-setting that charges the final image. One minor spatial slip: the safe’s location behind a “loose panel” feels generic.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lighthouse orchard, frost-bitten apples, and groaning ice are selective and atmospheric; the vintage store’s claustrophobic mirrors constrain movement and perception. The shard’s light bleeding into glass is a micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but pressure: creaking dock, frost-slick wood, moonlit collisions dictate stance and tempo. The parasol tip functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices what thins her membrane, ignores tourist detail. One hairline slip: “distant snow and salt” is generic filler amid otherwise razor-sharp selection.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    The amber pavilion and autumn vines are not backdrop; they supply the graft metaphor that reframes Leo’s loss and Elara’s response. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through her caretaker gaze. One spatial hiccup: “eastern edge” is mentioned once and never re-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pavilion’s psychic pressure, the blistering sand, the grinding parapet bones all constrain Elara’s steps and tactics. Each setting element is tactile, hot, and weighted; the conjured clearing is a second micro-setting that materially changes what can or cannot enter. The desert hush replaces the final image, underscoring the isolation the prophet’s echo carries.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lavender field and ruined factory are rendered with selective sensory weight; the stalk tip in the photograph physically constrains the final placement and reconfigures the panorama, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; scent lingers like “benevolent ghost,” charging exit image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The suspended hush is environment-ear; soundless dust motes and skeletal chandelier generate pressure. The crystal’s whispers mirror the “hush,” then reweight it as pregnant potential. Micro-setting (body-crystal) charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fog garden, chalk circle, and rusted bus function as micro-setting that constrains Silas’s movements and charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: “fog-thatched arches” mirror his mental haze; the cold metal of the bus becomes a stethoscope. Environment evolves with action—ivy slowly consuming the bus mirrors time’s consumption of the body. One hairline slip: “physics of vapor” is slightly ornamental, not tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lunar observatory is sketched with selective, sensorial strokes—“deep, metallic groan,” “polished floor,” “main viewport”—that ground the crisis without encyclopedic clutter. The station’s failing gyros function as both literal threat and metaphorical instability. The clock hand becomes micro-setting that constrains the final fix. One minor drift: “above the clouds” is never re-anchored, but the spatial choreography remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.5)
    “Radiant haven above the clouds” micro-setting frames the bed as floating altar; oxygen-rich scent, distant sky-light subtly pressurize the calm. Hospice room anchors are crisp; however, the larger cloud-haven doesn’t actively block tactics—the room itself already suffices—so full 9+ gating point not met.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating-isle observatory is sketched with selective sensory strokes (“cold mosaic floor,” “ozone from levitation cores”) that filter through Elara’s scholarly attention. The brass automaton functions as micro-setting and tool, constraining her choices until its reanimation rewrites the rules. Spatial choreography is tight; no impossible moves. The final image of the “seam in the world” is charged by the earlier star-chart desk.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear spatial anchors by line 3 (“stood over the small, still form in the clearing”). Garden’s bioluminescent blossoms and humming fireflies constrain choice—light guides the path, the blossom becomes the keepsake. Micro-setting (Fae’s fractured wrist) directly shapes the climax, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The grotto’s serpentine walls and mist filter light and choice; the tiny fissure is a precise aperture that enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, anchoring the POV’s coastal eye. The setting constrains the final action and charges the image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.7)
    Data-center-turned-moss-garden is vivid, selective, and constrains choices: server racks become planters, drip map guides attention. Sensory hierarchy filters through Lyra’s watchful bias. The setting’s slow decay and regrowth mirror internal recovery, charging the final image. Micro-setting (amber pendant, moss CPU) also functions as tool.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.0)
    The feral nexus in mist is not mere backdrop; its tidal logic (“everything that ever was or will be washes up”) constrains Elias’s perception and final action. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered: “salt and the murmur of things just beyond sight.” The shell functions as micro-setting object that charges the final image. A hairline slip: “feral nexus” is evocative but never fully anchored spatially, keeping it just under 8.5.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The arbor is sketched with selective, tactile detail (damp earth, copper coils) that constrains her movements and tools. The vine itself becomes micro-setting, its spindle grip dictating the final action. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure: moonlight and scent sharpen as stakes rise.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Subarctic crater, gnarled trees, and aurora are filtered through Elara’s selective attention; cold is felt in “crackle of ice-laden soil.” The copper plate and vial function as micro-setting that constrains the final sealing act. Sensory economy favors touch and sight under polar twilight. Final image of glowing map recharges the orchard’s latent life.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble cavern is not backdrop but instrument; its acoustic curves constrain every tactic and deliver the final harmonic chord. Sensory detail is selective—veined floor, drip metronome, indigo evening—filtered through Elara’s locksmith ear. One hairline slip: the “natural flute of stone” arrives late and could have been seeded earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The bronze grotto, star-slit roof, and crystalline walls are not backdrop; their cosmic orientation literally reorients her weaving. Sensory detail is selective—wet metal, old stone, starlight—and constrains the final choice. Micro-setting (lamp, pedestal) doubles as tool and axis. One hairline slip: “shingled hush” is evocative but never re-anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rain-beaded skylight and kettle hiss are selective, sensory, and tethered to Elara’s narrowed attention; the loft’s rust-hued peace mirrors her integrated grief. The ash blank evolves from raw wood to charged object, functioning as micro-setting that constrains her final stillness. Weather and tool jointly frame the closing image without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.1)
    The kinetic lagoon’s cloud-moss and ozone-mist anchor POV bias and constrain movement (soft footing, temporal drift). The camera wheel doubles as micro-setting, its cold edges anchoring Elara in “temporal soup.” Final image of the halted carousel recharges the setting as a blank page. No orientation debt; spatial anchors arrive by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    The terminal’s brutalist carcass is rendered through Elara’s engineering gaze—grime-caked permacrete, fractured dome glass—each detail constrains her redesign. The sextant fragment doubles as micro-setting and tool, its brass chill guiding alignment. Spatial choreography from gantry to planting bed is clean. Final image of rising steam recharges the “maze of intentions” with new flow.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting (guild hall, crystal forecourt, brass bear) is filtered through Elara’s precise, tactile attention; each object constrains or enables her final choice. Crystal sculptures and petrichor return in the closing image, reweighted by the restored symphony. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Canal, narrowboat, and sundial are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action (cold water, bruised-purple light). The sundial evolves from salvage object to key that reconfigures meaning. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Micro-setting (cabin lamplight) charges the final image. Minor: the town itself remains off-page, slightly blurring social context.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    The golden dock under snow, the fog, and the salt-stiffened rope function as micro-setting that constrains movement and attention. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; the rope’s texture and the fulgurite’s warmth guide the final choice. Environment charges the closing image without ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.5)
    Damp earth and chrysanthemum decay anchor the micro-setting; garden air tightens during the sensory flood, constraining Elara’s next step. The carpet’s oceanic geography literalizes stakes without cliché. Vividness doesn’t alter a final choice, keeping it from higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    The suspended palace, glass sanctum, and brass city below are not backdrop but pressure sources: height isolates, chains groan, geothermal conduits power the device. The ghost passing through glass recharges the dome as both setting and symbol. Sensory selection is urgent—oil smudges, humming crystals, fog-shrouded abyss—filtered through Kaelen’s strained attention. One minor drift: “geometric sprawl” is slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is tactile and selective; the obsidian lagoon and black sand constrain movement and mirror internal states. Micro-setting—the scarred tree—becomes the altar where closure occurs. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true. One minor drift: “kelp-drift peace” is lovely but risks ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    City, box, and migrating geese function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: the sealed box’s geometry forces Elara to trace leaf-veins instead of smashing glass; the geese’s pause supplies the hush that makes the unheard possible. Sensory selection is POV-biased and purposeful; fountains flow with light, not water, integrating setting into theme. No spatial drift; the plaza remains anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nebula garden is not backdrop; its magnetic fields and dust acoustics become the medium through which she weaves the extinct culture, constraining how the archive can be “shared.” Sensory hierarchy is biased to Elara’s sonar perception, keeping description purposeful. Final image of the garden as “museum of failure” recharges earlier serenity with new weight.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.8)
    The greenhouse is not backdrop but pressure chamber: broken panes admit the butterfly river, humidity condenses on the ribbon, ferns frame the ghost-table. One more sensory constraint (e.g., a thorn tearing her sleeve) would have nudged 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The obsidian ridge and brass pendulum bob are rendered with tactile specificity and directly constrain her final choice; the ridge becomes the monument to fallibility. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: volcanic glass under boots, bruised sky. Micro-setting (rake handle) functions as charged object. One notch from 9+ only because the village itself is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake are atmospheric anchors, but the kingfisher feather quill is the micro-setting that finally constrains choice—its iridescence against monochrome charges the act of writing; spatial grounding is immediate and tactile.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    The ember alcove, candle, mist, and radio dial are selective, sensory, and purposeful; the dial’s green glow becomes a “secretly luminous sun” that charges the final image.

The setting subtly mirrors internal pressure without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    The velvet library and autumn hush are filtered through Anya’s resigned attention; the zither itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the only possible lesson. Sensory detail is selective—dust motes, muffled silence, faint leaf scent—rather than catalogued. The rosette’s pattern is not just visual but tactile and acoustic, guiding the final image. Could be sharper on spatial choreography (table, chairs, distance).

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    Greenhouse rust “weeping orange tears,” gravity of collapsing glass, and silver-green moonlight all compress into an object-setting that physically constrains every choice. At closure the lattice of glowing leaves recharges the initial image of ruin-made-beauty, satisfying the constraint gate.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    The tower’s stone, gears, and lightning rods are tactile and constraining; the lacquer box functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—hum, flash, velvet—filtered through Elara’s anxious attention. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. Environment guides choice: the rods literally redirect the lightning that saves the hive.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Attic “dense watchful quiet,” salt-tinged air, and the streetlight bleed are tactile, precise, and integrated into the ritual handling of objects. The bay itself stays backdrop but each object’s placement alters spatial intimacy, constraining final placement of Elara’s new stone. Near 9+ but environment itself doesn’t tighten tactics—objects do.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The underwater garden is not backdrop but active constraint: pressure, kelp, pearls all re-signified by the ending. The fluted column’s hairline fracture is a micro-setting that enables the decisive action. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through the Statue’s mineral perception. One notch off 9.0 only because the historian’s suit tech remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.8)
    The infinite staircase is not backdrop but pressure engine: its grey stone constrains every step, the mist limits sight, and the sudden soil on the ruptured step re-weights the final image, turning confinement into medium for growth.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rooftop greenhouse, smog, and moonlight are filtered through Elara’s exhausted perception; the moon-tipped brush itself becomes micro-setting that constrains every artistic choice.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Aqualith’s cold spray and the emerald lens’s magnification of honeycomb letters weaponize micro-setting—darting moisture limits fire, the lens reframes destiny; environment is never backdrop but active antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse gallery, hunger stone, and low-tide exhale are selective, tactile, and thematically charged; the stone’s reprise in the final paragraph reweights the premise. Micro-setting (workbench, spindle) constrains the build.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    The funhouse’s grit, ozone, and shattered mirrors are selective and POV-filtered, constraining movement and echoing internal fracture. The clasp’s evolving luminance functions as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Weather is absent but not missed. One anachronistic phrase—“photographically cursed”—slightly jars the decayed carnival texture.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.9)
    The floating orchard, the glowing lemon, and the salt-twisted trunks are not backdrop; they are instruments that literally channel the storm’s force. Micro-setting (the mallet, the etched bark) constrains every tactical choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: Kai notices cloud fractals before he smells salt.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The turtle-shell city, sun-bleached dread, and stone watchers are rendered in selective, purposeful detail that constrains choice: the rusted gate is a literal barrier, the watchers’ spiral palms a directional map. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kaelen’s cartographer eye—spirals, fractures, load-bearing stress—integrating setting into action. The environment evolves with the crack and the humming wind, charging the final image. Micro-setting (the whistle, the gate’s rust) functions as setting and tool.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    The disused station’s damp air and moss-covered bench are vivid, selective, and filter through Aris’s historian’s eye. The rosebush and petal function as micro-setting objects that trigger the entire plot. Spatial choreography is clean; bodies and distances track. Environment does not merely decorate—it times the meeting and charges the final image with autumnal decay.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    The submerged pavilion is not backdrop but active constraint—cold water, algae-slick columns, and the locket lodged in a joint all shape tactics. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered.
