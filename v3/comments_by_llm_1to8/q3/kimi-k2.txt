    The musical crystal cave is vividly sensorial and actively shapes events: steps chime, spires retune, walls become ribs, a mirror/gate opens. The environment constrains tactics (sound as mirror/gate; the corridor of fire within the cave’s body) and charges the final image (the cave’s “final chord” and lingering violet). Specific, evolving details track physical changes. Setting and object interlock without postcard excess.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    The harbor, lighthouse, seawall, and weather are not postcard backdrops; they dictate tactics and yield resources (ink‑bled labels, cracked lens, barnacles’ “doors”) that shape each beat. The trumpet valve functions as an object‑as‑setting, culminating in a beam that literally configures the space and her history into a staff. Sensory texture is selective and POV‑true, with maritime detail working as apparatus rather than decoration. The environment decisively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Place and object are vivid and functional: cracks in pavement form arrows; a misted, starlit vault frames a liminal journey; the phantom punch actively gates access and charges the final image. Sensory specificity is selective and POV‑true (“upholstery patterned with constellations she had once sketched”). The environment constrains options (follow arrows, take the train) and evolves (mist lifts at dawn). World rules feel consistent within the dream logic.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    The tower, sea, and migration are tactile and specific, with sensory range beyond the visual (salt wind, humming arches, whale song).

The spiral fragment operates as micro‑setting/tool, constraining ritual acts and charging the final image. Sensory specificity is purposeful and POV‑filtered (ink‑smelling mud, reeds moaning, pages like gills). Environment evolves with events (mist thickens, then lifts into a corridor of pages) and directs the route to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    The arbor, moonlight, vine, and crank are vividly filtered through Liora’s sensibility and folded into action rather than postcarded. The environment constrains timing (moon at horizon, gathering hush) and charges the final image (tendril-bracelet, lingering glow). Sensory specifics stay purposeful and tonally unified. Slight lushness never muddies spatial logic or rules.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    The subarctic crater orchard is tactile and operative: cold, silence, and fragility constrain movement and tempo. Tools and objects (plate, obsidian seal, discarded items) are interwoven into action and the final image.

    The treetop village is rendered through Ari’s nose and fingertips; cedar stairs, orchid-bark cradle, and tide-breath all constrain her ritual choices. Sensory hierarchy is strict—salt, pine, clove, thunderstorm—guiding attention. The final bloom’s scent drifting down through bridges makes the setting charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The inverted river, floating arches, and luminous spores are not backdrop but tactical terrain: Kael navigates by water flow, uses zero-G to reach the mother-tree, and escapes the re-sealing arch. The arrow-tip constellation inside the cavern constrains the final insertion and charges the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift. One missed sensory layer (smell) is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Container labyrinth is tactile—salt-stained concrete, corrugated walls, swinging bulb—yet always filtered through the investigator’s goal-directed attention. Silk ribbon and bulb cord become micro-settings that constrain tactics: ribbon snaps, bulb bursts, cueing the final act. Weather (tide, wind) is causal, not backdrop. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ice cavern, aurora, and marble block constrain every choice; the marble literally reshapes under her touch, charging the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (cedar, lullaby, first snow). Environment evolves causally with events; no static repetition. Micro-setting (prism-song bells on her wrists) functions as tool and constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.6)
    Thunder-echo range and canyon hush function as active pressure: the “moaning crack” and “bell struck once” shape the keeper’s ritual. Driftwood markers and basalt shelf constrain body placement and spiral geometry. Sensory detail is selective—wind shift, gold leaf warmth—filtered through keeper’s guilt. Final image of range exhaling recharges the quiet as shelter, not accusation.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Topaz roof, copper glow, and ink stone anchor early; micro-setting of chase and halo constrain final reversal. Sensory hierarchy narrows to pulse-cold glass and starless hum, mirroring internal erasure. Environment evolves: walls thin into transparency, floorboards pace—setting actively pressures the choice to reverse the press.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.6)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway is never mere backdrop; its shifting green and violet pulses mirror Mira’s heartbeat and tighten the dawn deadline. Micro-settings—the tollgate bell, the shared fire—constrain choices and charge the final cliff-edge meeting. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. The pendant itself functions as micro-setting that alters social encounters.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard’s moss, dew, cracked basin, and twisted apple boughs are filtered through Lira’s grief-narrowed perception. Micro-setting (the stump as workbench, the bead as lens) constrains her choices and charges the final image. Sensory economy favors touch and temperature over visual catalog. One minor spatial drift: monks’ rummage sale location relative to orchard remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock arches and azure crystal seams are not backdrop; they constrain tactics—crystal source, lattice transport on cart rails—and charge the final image when azure threads climb bark. Sensory selection is urgent: “gravel like old bones,” “water tasted of storms.” Setting evolves with stakes: failing orchards → luminous fruit.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Abandoned bay and shard-as-micro-setting constrain every move; the bay’s rust and sideways corridors guide redirection. Sensory specificity (“oil-stained deck,” “recycled air”) filters through Lira’s map-maker bias. Final image—shard sealed in the crack—recharges the setting as map.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lantern room, sea glass, and salt-lilac scent constrain every beat; the glass reappears in the final image to charge the flask. Spatial choreography is tight; no white-room drift. Just shy of 9.0 because the reef itself remains off-stage abstraction rather than active constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Emerald lighthouse, reef, and black-sun pupil constrain every tactical choice; the lens array and fractured wick are micro-settings that alter possibilities. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Kael’s storm-tuned perception. Final image reweights the entire setting as the green dust seeds the new dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating rock, wing-glass, and valley mist constrain every move; the tea-house lanterns and condensed-memory staircase charge the final image. One spatial hiccup—“valley mist wonder thickened” reads as filler—prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.7)
    Stormlit tower, moonlight, and oak roots are vivid, selective, and purposeful; each constrains choice (roots break through wall, moonlight heals brass).

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    Broken palace, moss swallows marble, lantern-lit wisteria doorway—details filter through the noticer’s eye and guide movement. The courtyard rectangle of darker stone is used as actual planting bed, not postcard. Spatial choreography—silence on moss, kneeling—remains coherent. Minor late appearance (-0.1) but element shapes final act.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The frozen library is not backdrop; its hoarfrost stairs and quartz walls constrain movement and echo the crystallization of memory. The lantern’s brass cradle and the aurora pages are tactile tools that shape the ritual. Final image of walls returning to water vapor links setting dissolution to choice. One hairline slip: “vaulted halls of ice and glass” is slightly generic before specificity arrives.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.5)
    The pirate market’s kerosene-cinnamon-gun-oil triad anchors tone and supplies pressure; the cedar box’s micro-setting ultimately charges the final image. 9+ gate met.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Whispering Bluff's wind, basalt, and cloud ceiling are not postcard backdrop but active forces: wind powers sculpture, clouds receive droplets, stone erases footprints. Micro-setting of sealskin and tuning fork serve as portable architecture where memory lives. All physical laws remain consistent; only the impossible droplet orbit is explicitly motivated by sculpture's sympathetic resonance. No anchor drift; altitude and temperature stay intact through descent.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    Desert, dome, roses, and even Lumen’s metal skin are vividly particular and become active constraints—glass fogged with condensed memory, mirrored surface that deters the wildfire—yet the environment could have pressed even more visibly onto the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Courtyard tiles, rosemary scent, and welded mailbox constrain Mira’s path and charge the final image. Micro-setting (mailbox iron) functions as crucible. One hairline slip: “muted amber” sky is slightly stock.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.6)
    Glass corridor's chill, strut-spinning spider, cube of finger-bone dice — each object constrains stance or clocks time. Over-description of flood-city atmosphere risks postcard drift once.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    Gravity itself functions as setting; ceiling pulls feet off the ground while waist-level pressure kneecaps—literal constraints on how Mara can move. Salt columns and luminous memory-pool anchor spatial choreography; the final descent beneath the tiles is spatially tracked. Dock and chamber feel singular enough that relocating the tale would break its physics.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The brook, moonlight, and paper wing function as micro-setting that actively constrains tactics: the water’s ripples are the enemy code, the wing becomes a canopy and then a bridge. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (“moonlight silvering the water into a mirror of smoothed hush”).

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sparse, exact detail: cedar scent on wax, verbena in tin cans, cornices flexing like eyebrows. The rooftop garden meteor shower is not backdrop but oracle, constraining the final communal interrogation. Sensory hierarchy mirrors escalating awe.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.9)
    The velvet garden’s neural blooms and marble lectern are rendered with selective sensory density that constrains Mara’s path.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Glacier, shrine, candleflames, and narwhal-tooth locket are all vivid and specific; micro-objects (globe, locket) constrain final action and charge the ending. No contradiction, and the cold/heat polarity feeds internal tension. Meets the micro-setting gate for 9+ but lacks a constraining environmental obstacle beyond temperature memory.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.1)
    Black-water harbor mist, teal-glint whisk shadow, firefly constellations become tactile constraints of care; each object constrains motion and refines next action, culminating in moon path reprise that articulates cost.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    The orchard is no backdrop; its radioactive dust, hybrid trunks, and quartz stillpoint actively shape tactics—she reassembles letters beneath translucent quartz because the place widens time. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: iodine-cinnamon wind, flawed glass fruit, Geiger-silent dawn. The setting constrains the final act: only here can the Apple become a tree of memory. Micro-detail (saddle-leather satchel, paper compass) grounds the speculative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory above clouds, cobalt portico, and stormlit static are rendered with tactile specificity; the portico constrains Cassia’s movements and ultimately folds open to birth the silhouette, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.9)
    The loft’s broken louvers and breathing dunes constrain every move—sand rattles like applause, dictating haste. The music box’s blistered lacquer and frozen ballerina function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory selection is urgent: iron-tasting dawn whistle, wax the color of old piano keys. One minor slip: “feral loft” is vivid but momentarily disorients before “beneath the dunes” grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Drift-ice marina is not backdrop but instrument: its acoustic properties force the ritual and glow with the final chord. Every sensory choice (shattered-glass floes, ringing hum) tightens the scene’s stakes. The lighthouse beam at the end recharges the setting as resonant chamber.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    Basalt, frost, lake ice, moon glare, and compass needles constrain every tactic; the viaduct’s buried rails literally shape the fracture pattern. These material anchors physically reconfigure in the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tunnel’s mineral drips, rust patterns, and compass-scorched bricks constrain Maya’s measurements and later reveal the route’s history. Lantern light reconfigures the space into a map of escape; the final image of rain tapping grates charges the setting with applause-like release. Micro-setting (toolkit satchel) also functions as setting-object hybrid.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The cedar-and-brass shop, the velvet pad, the chapel’s pipe organ all constrain choices (only Vale can repair, only the chapel allows the final scene). The storm’s single silver shaft literalizes the “light through crack” motif and charges the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.0)
    The floating acid-sea workshop (setting+tool) constrains tactics—corroding hull, boilers fueled by obsolete maps, bronze molten in hostile air. Every surface is tactile; space and physics hold. Setting subtly guides every choice and recharges final silence as crystallized sea.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archive’s “chilled silence” and humming towers are not backdrop but pressure—temperature readouts and server racks literally guide her to rack 117.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Fog garden, driftwood markers, and stacked-television sculpture are not backdrop; they channel physical movement (spiral path, chalk line) and modal shift (static → recording tone). Specific resource—bleached driftwood as compass needles—constrains placements until center shell closes ending image. Micro-setting object/tool identity charges final sculpture, making element indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dome, brass gear, and moon-dust grains are handled, not catalogued; each constrains choice (tilting the lens toward the void instead of Earth-light). Sensory selection is biased by Elara’s profession—precision tools, “brass casing,” “silver blur”—and the final image repurposes the reflective hand as fractured moons. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The environment actively charges the closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    The radiant haven above clouds is sketched with selective sensory detail—skylight, slate-rain scent—that constrains Mara’s toolkit (smuggled turntable, forbidden shards).

    The feral nexus is evoked through selective sensory detail (ink-scented mud, unlit lantern) that constrains movement and mirrors the novelist’s inner swamp. The spiral seashell functions as micro-setting, its warmth and erosion guiding her choices. Spatial anchors are clear early; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.7)
    The arbor’s dew-laden dawn and amber moon-slit canopy directly pressure choices (public vs silence, risk vs ritual) and returns as charged final imagistic echo; specificity never drifts into static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.8)
    Subarctic orchard, copper plate, and paper animals are rendered with tactile specificity; the frost “remembering it was once water” charges the final image. Environment constrains choice—cold demands slowness, dead roots supply ritual objects. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room. Micro-setting (plate as altar) functions as setting and tool. Weather and darkness directly shape pacing and stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marble veins, frost fingers, and duplicated candle-flames are not backdrop but instruments: the cavern’s reflective geometry dictates the 43°/31°/0° angles that drive every choice, and the final empty mirrors re-echo the loss. Sensory hierarchy is locksmith-precise, filtering wonder through tool and light.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sensory economy drives stakes: bronze drip, oxidized ribs, whalebone reverie across walls. Micro-setting becomes active—walls accept burdens, exhale after settling weights. Spatial anchoring sustained ("under starlight filtering through cracks") and mirrored in burner shadows. Constraints crystallize final stance: stone not flesh now holds. 9+ gate test met: grotto calcifies to constrain and carry her absolution.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.7)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is not backdrop; its condensation, chains, and eaves-drip constrain Mara’s tactile method and echo her interior state.

Micro-setting (salt runes, sea-smoke) constrains footing and mood, integrating with Elara’s tactile ritual. One notch below 9+ only because the ridge’s agency is more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    Selective, urgent detail—yew hush, marble angel’s hand, dew on every blade—grounds every beat. The cobalt silo’s curved wall and the tapestry’s whispering threads constrain movement and choice. Micro-setting (sovereign case, lantern, spade) functions as extension of body. One hairline slip: “velveteen gloom” repeats enough to edge toward motif checklist, but it modulates with pressure and charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Obsidian spire’s warmth and volcanic memory constrain her tactics—she must ground innovation in geological fact. Frozen lake’s seasonal melt becomes the literal energy source she models; micro-setting (frost on vellum) functions as tool. Sensory hierarchy favors tactile and thermal detail over visual catalog.

    Orchard actively constrains choices—the roots’ growl responds to spices, petals form ritual carpet—while the pouch of rare spices becomes micro-setting that charges the final image through recurring sensory specificity ("cinnamon and memory" perfuming constellations).

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Cracked saucer constrains every choice: alignment as compass, thread emergence, sealing as scar. Final image—saucer "whole enough to hold the future"—charges closure through prior object logic. Sensory details (glowing moss, iron-lavender repentance) serve urgency without checklist overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.3)
    Emergency blanket's silver thread constrains Lin's action (stitching photographs) and charges the final image as "lanterns of shadow"; hydroponic basil and flaking deck plates create lived-in specificity that directly enables the dimensional breakthrough.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.3)
    Volcanic sand actively charges closure: footprints filling with light, glass handprint trapping bug light. Environment constrains choice (beach as detour) and evolves causally (sand→glass). Meets 9+ gate—final image’s trapped light reweights giving’s texture through setting.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.3)
    Bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting, constraining three key choices (sigil, sundial alignment, bird programming) and charging closure via "glinting like a secret kept." Sensory specificity in "hot metal and parchment" scent elevates beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.3)
    Tidal bluff constrains every choice (rock placement on frictionless sand, jar-filling at edge); "borrowed dawn" motif charges the final image ("inside of a shell"). Aurora isn't backdrop but active pressure shaping the dust-harnessing ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Darkroom timer and bus timetable function as micro-settings that constrain choices (routes as stitches, backward-ticking seconds); final image charges scars-as-roads motif with undeniable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.2)
    The half-painted sundial constrains every choice—aligning needles to facets dictates direction—and charges closure when breeze shifts it to "depart together." Brook’s reflection projecting constellations onto palms makes micro-setting indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.2)
    Rusted library isn't backdrop—it enables action (bullet-holed skylight for paper birds, mildew/gunpowder scents). Coffee tin's false bottom constrains choices (hiding map, seedpods). Final image charged by birds "sprouting" from broken roof, reweighting concrete as resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    Tidal arbor's silver leaves and broken clock constrain choices (rewinding film, modulating music) and charge final image (lily-clock blooming on bough). Sensory hierarchy reflects pianist's urgency: "sea-smell though no ocean" mirrors emotional dislocation.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.0)
    Ridge functions as micro-setting: composted song soil dictates planting depth, monsoon clouds "counting down days" constrain tactics, and final "ridge straightened" charges closure with embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.0)
    The compass constrains choice by directing Helini’s ritual ("tucked beneath her tongue, felt its cold point whispering left"), charging the final image where it aligns her breathing with "water returning to stone." Micro-setting (lace, moss-lined box) actively shapes tactics, meeting the 9+ gate for environmental constraint.
