Environment shapes tactics by requiring dawn light and the cathedral’s glass to decode.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vivid, tactile settings (zeppelin library; sun‑scorched dunes; obsidian lagoon) shape tactics: debris messaging, phantom wind scattering, dunes threatening burial. The lagoon functions as a charged object that shades the enforcer and the pact’s location, and it colors the ending’s meditation. Environmental pressure is integrated into action, not pasted on. A hair more spatial choreography at the lagoon’s edge would perfect it.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    Paper‑Lantern Cove feels specific and atmospheric, with lanterns and sea rhythm filtered through Elias’s purpose. The amber bottle and lanterns function as charged objects; the final image (real flame) reweights prior illusions. Detail remains selective and purposeful.

The score is capped from a higher tier due to flaws elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting of the blooming fortress is exceptional, acting as both atmosphere and a thematic mirror for the protagonist's struggle.

While the environment enables the narrative, it stops just short of directly constraining a key choice, which would be required to elevate it into the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.2)
    The setting is exceptional, moving from the specific clutter of the workshop to the decaying greenhouse and the roaring waterfall.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Gallery is micro-cast as a resonant chamber: “curved stone walls...voices carried like secrets” constrains motion (the echo-path Alex must trace) and delivers the final auditory proof of success. Atmosphere is distilled rather than broad-brushed; every spatial cue is filtered through Alex’s ear. The pawnless board and the “high slits” of light return in the climactic image, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mountain-bookstore is tactile and selective: “stone veins twisted into endless shelves,” “chamber carved from the mountain’s core.” The setting constrains choice—only within this labyrinth can the stone be found—and the orb’s shards become part of the final image. A touch more spatial anchoring in the alcove scene would have nudged it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    Limited physical setting, yet the platinum crevasse of labyrinths and sonic-absorbing tapestry function as "environmental tools," constricting tactics and embedding cost (tactile maze burns/de-curses).

Place never drifts; canal bank, barge, and lantern remain spatially coherent even underwater.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Golden dock, snow, fog, and rope form a micro-setting that constrains every choice: visibility narrows, cold exacts stamina, rope becomes archive. Sensory hierarchy is POV-filtered and purposeful. The dock’s planks reappear in the final image, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Selective sensory layering—autumn leaves, damp earth scent, moss texture—grounds the single scene without over-cataloguing. Garden architecture (ancient cathedral ribs, crimson ivy) serves atmospheric counter-current to internal loneliness. No prop thread or body constraint visibly rewrites choice; it’s backdrop not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The suspended palace is not backdrop but active constraint: its quakes dictate Elandor’s tremors, its geothermal vents power the cradle, its stalactite teeth frame the final image. Sensory selection is urgent—crystal spires quiver, dust falls like stars—mirroring internal stakes. The cradle itself becomes micro-setting, its brass gears and vines constraining assembly choices. One minor drift: “forgotten teeth” metaphor is vivid but slightly over-cooked.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Obsidian lagoon, volcanic sand, and kelp strands are filtered through Elara’s fire-trained senses; each detail constrains the grafting ritual.
