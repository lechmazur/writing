The crystalline panels and frost formations charge the final image when they transform into the visual symphony.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.2)
    The underwater library with floating books and kelp-wrapped columns creates vivid, purposeful atmosphere that enables the resolution. The broken lens constrains and enables the final choice perfectly. Minor deduction for some generic descriptors ("flat, leaden plate").

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.6)
    The terra-cotta arbor and sandstone paths create specific constraints that shape the midnight runs. Sensory hierarchy works well—"the note seemed to hang in the air, amplified by the quiet, a sound so pure it felt like a physical thing." The setting doesn't quite reach 9+ because while atmospheric, it doesn't decisively constrain the final choice.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Exceptional sensory layering - "night-blooming jasmine," "indigo rays," "fog soft and gauzy." The viaduct setting actively constrains choices through the camera obscura's inverted projections. The physical environment (brick, wisteria, fog) mirrors and enables the spiritual discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The living bridge garden setting directly constrains choices (where Elara finds the fragment) and provides the laboratory for her temporal experiments. Sensory details like "scent of freshly-cut yew" and the fragment "cool-to-the-touch" ground key moments. The maze's non-Euclidean geometry becomes essential to solving the problem, though some descriptions lean abstract ("texture of time itself").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned carnival setting pressures choices through its decay and hidden vault. The piano's "horribly flat" note and "dissonant, stumbling chord" embody the world's brokenness.

    The emerald silo, the rust streaks, and the shard’s cool glaze create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere filtered through Leo’s sensibility. The environment supports action (a garage‑sale table outside the silo) and charges the final image via the object‑as‑setting function of the shard. Details balance specificity with economy; the mechanical bird and postcards feel lived‑in rather than touristic. While the silo doesn’t impose hard constraints, it meaningfully colors choices and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.1)
    The lagoon after rain shapes action and meaning: the shallows receive the kite, shore‑grass becomes material, and the still water mirrors the transformation. Details are sensorially precise and POV‑filtered (burnished hush, lap of wavelets). The environment charges the final image (the feather blazing against the rock in that hush). Setting is not postcard; it constrains tools and frames the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.0)
    The temple orchard and living stone pillars are tactile, sonically alive (“geothermal song”), and integral to tactics and outcome. The environment directly constrains the method (copper-branch-to-stone bridge) and charges the final image (stone and flora weaving architecture). Sensory detail is selective and POV-shaped, avoiding tourist cataloging. World rules (vibration/stone communication) remain consistent and dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.1)
    The environment is vivid and purposeful: the rainwashed tower, overgrown sculpture path, and “bronze” soundscape frame and constrain the ritual. The path functions as an engineered setting that exerts pressure and delivers the message; the fly amber operates as a charged micro‑setting object. Sensory selection matches POV (scientific instruments against metallic hush) and charges the final image (aged metal warmth). World rules are learned through observation and action, not dump.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the blooming jetty, bioluminescent algae, skeletal reef, and salted flats filter through Elros’s priorities.

    Greenhouse, storm, and linden leaf constrain every choice; mossy trellis trembles with anticipation, charging the final sketch. Sensory hierarchy (ozone, wet earth) filters through Aris’s botanist gaze. One hairline slip: “half a mile away” is an unmotivated precision.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal island’s twice-daily reshaping is not backdrop but constraint: the western shore is accessible only because the storm has scoured it. The geometric stone pattern is a micro-setting that literally channels choice. Sensory detail is selective—salt, bruised sky, gleaming sand—and filtered through Kaelen’s painterly eye. One missed beat: no tactile interaction with the stone grooves.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Cathedral of Song is evoked with pitch-perfect sensory economy; each crystal’s note, the middle-C waterfall, and the velvety blackness constrain tactics (sound as weapon, darkness as threat). The setting actively shapes the climax—light fracturing shadows—earning its place in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rain-scrubbed harbor of bone-color stone is not backdrop but pressure: the wet quays force careful footing, the memorial’s angles become legible code, the puddles mirror both sky and skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    The subterranean lagoon is atmospherically rich and thematically resonant, yet its capacity to physically constrain action is under-deployed; the water is present but does not dictate Silas’s move—it serves awe more than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    Storm-tossed archway is not backdrop but antagonist; its fracture lines literally diagram decay and guide the carving. Driftwood’s “iron-hard” grain and the turbine-hum wind supply tactile constraints that shape the final sculpture. Sensory hierarchy stays sculptor-centric, never tourist-catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is selective and purposeful: the amber pavilion’s light, the cathedral’s dusty shafts, and the melting snow all constrain visibility and timing. The moon-sap diagram etched in glass becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The obsidian lagoon is not backdrop; it is Kenneth’s prison and the medium of dialogue, constraining every choice Elara makes. Sensory detail is selective: “violet light” from within the black water, “phosphorescent seaweed” spelling a name. Spatial choreography is coherent—rope ladder, dunes, flat shore, lagoon edge—guiding her path to the parley.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ghost town’s salt-sprayed observatory, cove of paper lanterns, and dust-choked library are rendered through Elara’s selective perception—she notices “the scent of baking bread ghosted from a bakery’s cold oven,” a sensory detail that guides choice. The lanterns evolve from “feeble” to “warm, welcoming,” mirroring the internal shift. The amber bottle itself functions as micro-setting, constraining her tactics until she redefines its use. Minor slip: “hollow whispers” leans generic, but the specificity elsewhere compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystalline orchard atop the skyscraper is vivid, selective, and thematically resonant; its eternal blossom contrasts the steel city and charges the final dread. The brass phonograph functions as micro-setting that constrains her choice in the last beat.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.7)
    The icebound atrium is no postcard; its glass dome, frozen shelves, and starlight prism constrain every motion and refract the final warmth.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    The windblown sanctuary, brass dials, and cathedral bell are not backdrop but instruments that constrain tactics; the bell’s bronze voice literally replaces the electric siren. Sensory selection narrows under pressure (“wind fell utterly still”). Final image of the rope and storm turning charges the setting with conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.7)
    Station is sensuously rendered—metal “mirror finish” under starlight and cosmic hush—but micro-setting’s most potent charge is the lantern glass; removal would blunt the final constraint, so meets gate.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The beekeeping oasis is tactile—dust, rot, cool glass—yet never catalogued. The stained-glass box functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: its panels force Silas to accept custodianship. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. One minor spatial vagueness: “beside the window” could track cleaner.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    Obsidian seed’s body, lake’s icy water, silver orchard—each constrains choices. Seed freezes in hand; lake stilled becomes arena. Vivid, selective specifics root the final crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt glade is not mere backdrop; its stones, roots, and scarlet shadow constrain movement and charge the final image. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, meeting the 9+ gate, but one moment of slightly generic “world dreams bleeding in” caps it at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.6)
    Catacomb orchard is sensory, selective, and<|reserved_token_163752|>ester-pinpoint: roots constrain reach, fungi dictate light. Final image uses same roots to reweight the theme; no space is wasted.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    The quarry shed’s rusted machinery and diesel ghosts mirror Silas’s internal corrosion; the speaker cloth scrap on the desk anchors the trailer micro-setting.

Meets 9+ gate: environment shapes the decisive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.4)
    Crystal caves’ resonant hush and the oyster shell’s spiral mouth anchor early; the pearl’s glow later re-illuminates the same hush in the woman’s living room, charging the final image. Selective sensory detail (salt air, quartz facets) filters through Elara’s professional eye without tourist clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ivy-choked ticket hall and patched bellows operate as re-mended extensions of Elara’s psyche; they both house and constrain her final choice—she walks out carrying the tangible “map of a soul” that would lose all charge without the station’s damp decay.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glowing, mist-shrouded library is sketched with selective sensorial detail and supplies both resources (the watch’s resonance) and pressure (immense silence), constraining every action.

Environment shapes tactics and final image—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is never mere backdrop: the perpetual violet twilight is weaponized, its sterility pressing against Alder’s eyelids until it finally buckles into genuine darkness. The geode laboratory constrains choices—“hollowed-out geode thrusting from the central mass”—its crystalline walls become surfaces Alder must touch and later scorch. Sensory texture (rose, violet, mercurial pool, hissing elixirs) is selective and character-filtered. The moment the helix ignites, the environment visibly reconfigures (twilight deepening toward promising night), charging the closure with felt shift of the ambient light that had once imprisoned him.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)
    Ruined corridor debris, bioluminescent cable colony, and the oppressive “cathedral of ruin” are vivid, selective, and feed the stakes; the wet-sand countdown gives the body-as-clock texture. Undersea cables are rendered as stakes-internal symbols rather than mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.5)
    The dome, brass console, and inkblot are selective yet tactile; the spilled ink even doubles as a literal galaxy. Setting steers every tactic—only the console’s surface offers Julian’s prison. Micro detail of porcelain in her glove adds bodily constraint. However, the perpetual snow outside remains atmospheric rather than shaping an on-page choice, capping at 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is not backdrop but coercive force: the bone spires and wind turbulence literally shape the sonic grammar she must obey. Micro-setting (the diamond, her copper veins) constrains the final choice—veins become permanent conduit. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven, narrowing to tactile memory under pressure. One minor spatial blur: “balcony of fused rib” could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden’s “gravitationally playful” physics directly constrains the climax: the arrowhead orbits instead of cutting. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Aris’s researcher gaze. The underground cavern and its warped rules anchor every beat without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “narrow crevice between a bakery and a bank” grounds space economically; starlight refracted through dust motes becomes a functional map that guides the ritual. The ribbon’s texture and faded dye recur as tactile anchors. Only the cosmic timeframe remains slightly abstract, keeping it from 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drowned greenhouse is more than backdrop; debris angles, refracted starlight, and petrified root systems guide the final dive. Tactile specificity (knee-deep icy water, salt-bleached trees) is selective and character-lensed. Environment could more actively constrain breath/air choice under water, holding it just shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.0)
    Glass domed cliff chamber, fracturing starlight, and coiled net are select, sensorially sharp, and serve the climactic charge; they shape tactical access (light for sight, net as memory channel) rather than mere backdrop. Still, they provide setting rather than final constraint, capping high 8s.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.9)
    The vault’s rain-scoured stone, oculus light, and floor-crack are tactile and constrain every move. The miniature henge recharges the setting in the final chamber, making the environment an active participant. One notch off perfection only because the fresco ceiling fades to backdrop after introduction.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    The library’s decay—shelves “bloated with leather-bound books that sway like kelp”—is tactile, selective, and constrains movement.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.7)
    Frost-tight stone halls, whispers from gorse, and bronze gears scraping wall are all vivid and POV-coded. Micro-setting (pedestal, copper wings) constrains his final choice and reweights the sky as lit path. Missing anchor on year or country feels intentional. One slip: “graceless beauty” told rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is selective and purposeful: the braided ravine’s “constant division and reunion” mirrors the thematic question. The limestone shelf and river foam act as micro-settings that directly enable the insight; however, the ravine itself does not physically constrain the final choice, keeping it just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glass orchard is not mere backdrop; its flickering leaves become the diagnostic screen that quantifies absence. Spatial choreography is clean: lectern, bottle, filament, exit onto clouds.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto’s mist, serpentine paths, stone “teeth,” and inverted ceiling-floor reversal are sharply drawn, filtered through Elara’s scientist-archivist gaze. Gravity inversion is tactile: “pebbles shivered… down became up.” Sensory economy is admirable—no excess tours—while the same setting simultaneously constrains tactical choices after inversion. The grotto’s rule change is both atmosphere and pressure, satisfying the 9+ quick test but capped at 8.9 by the minor genericism of “clinging mist.”

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.4)
    Grove functions as micro-setting: the alder trunks physically constrain arch placement and supply heartstring fibers. Porcelain insulator evolves from passive listener to active mediator, charging the final image. Sensory selection is POV-filtered—she “feels for the latent song,” not tourist catalog.

Slight over-purple “silken quiet, thick and deep” risks cliché but is isolated.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The vine-bridge canopy is tactile and spatially coherent. Sensory hierarchy is filtered through olfac POV bias: “wildflower hush” versus “pungent memory.” Only the hut’s limited micro-setting constrains final choices—sunshift access to pot—but environment does not rewire tactics, so remains just below 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    Verdure’s floating rock arches and upward-flowing water are vivid, selective, and immediately tied to navigation. The crystalline geode functions as micro-setting that constrains the final revelation; its light and silence absorb all sound, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lantern room is rendered via temperature, metal clangs, and salt grief, all filtered through Elias’s wary practicality. The stones on the bluff are never visually described; they function as abstract semaphore, so the micro-setting is under-furnished. Still, the room’s gear teeth and grating cold actively constrain the cairn act, and the sea glass warms in hand, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.2)
    Valley-mist and sun-pools are vivid, selective, and bias-filtered through Hira’s chromatic eye. The hovering rock and vine anchoring are sketched with just enough spatial coherence to orient. The tea-house micro-setting constrains the final revelation, charging the morpho-wing projection.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.8)
    Greenhouse, starless void, silver-bough trees, and mica window are vivid and selective. The mica window constrains the final choice—singing into it—and the swaddled fruits become literal threads in the closing tapestry. Spatial anchors are immediate; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The courtyard’s curated decay constrains tactics—only those who see can enter, and the crocuses must be planted along a path “only they would ever walk.” Sensory detail is selective and urgent: “hollow, silent chill,” “sour earth,” “soft, inner light.” Micro-setting (the bread in hand) becomes a charged object that alters state. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystalline spires, frostbite air, and resonant light filter gorgeously through Elara’s perception. Crucially, the reimagined Great Hall and the slide’s internal geometry physically reconfigure stakes (“a recipe for resurrection”), proving the setting is not mere wallpaper.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rotting pier’s skeletal legs and dissolving market constrain movement and mirror Elara’s crumbling trust; the recorder’s copper horn becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (salt/decay/spices) and filtered through Elara’s criminal fluency.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lavender bluff and aurora are not backdrop; their scent and light constrain Kael’s path and charge the final image. Micro-setting of the vibrating ring functions as tactile terrain. One minor drift: “valleys that only voted in twilight” is vivid but momentarily disorients before re-anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    “Forgotten estate on the city’s edge” and “crumbling stairs” orient spatially; crystal walls flare “from sorrowful blue to vibrant gold,” functioning as transformative catalyst. The easel and living crystal wall are objects that constrain the final act— only their surface can receive prismatic energy— meeting the environment-as-constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    The greenhouse tiers, toxic sky, and subterranean root-vents are vivid yet selective; the cavern of voices becomes a living setting that charges the final image. Micro-setting (glass studio, warped floorboard) constrains early action. Only the brief plumber scene keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    The bluff’s stone cold, thin air, and copper wires constrain possible motions and tune delicate weights; kinesthetic detail makes tool, setting, and body inseparably fused in each escalating beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass dome, pulsing roses, and archive vault are sketched with sensory economy; the roses’ organic stems literally accept the compressed chaos, constraining the final choice. Spatial anchors are immediate and coherent; no white-room syndrome. The setting evolves with the magnetic storm, charging the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.2)
    The courtyard’s “sandstorm calm” and the locked mailbox function as micro-settings that constrain tactics: the mailbox’s sealed slot forces Elara to listen instead of deliver. Sensory detail is selective—tarnished silver, dry rustle of Mrs. Gable’s voice—filtered through Elara’s curator gaze. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    The corroded brass cathedral and anti-gravitic sphere are not backdrop; they constrain movement and supply the dice that generate every lock. Sensory detail is selective—viscous fluid, mournful pressure—filtered through Elara’s dancer’s proprioception. The setting evolves as the chamber fills with liberated light, recharging the opening image of murk.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt cathedral constrains breath, movement, and light; the chamber literally reconfigures the final image when the crystal shell cracks and memories spill. Sensory specifics—bitter coffee sludge, sharp air, gleam—are filtered through Elara’s task, never touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Smoothed hush made tactile: stone hums dim, leaves stop rustling, crane’s glow dims. Environment as tool constrains summoner’s every inhalation; final quiet is reweighted via place.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop garden is not backdrop but living lexicon: soil scent guides her first step inside, parched autumn stalks mirror the thinning lies, and the meteor shower finally burns away the veil. The seal’s bronze weight anchors the final image, constraining her to permanence.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Garden’s velvet dusk and Archive’s stone plinth are tactile constraints; the shell’s phosphorescence becomes the literal light source for the climax. Spatial choreography holds as Elara moves boot-to-plinth without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble walls, subterranean chill, pearly aurora and her thorn tool create a crucible: each constrains the forged strokes (cold limits drying time) and bathes the final image in iridescent justice. Sensory selection biases under threat; the space is never a postcard. The seal-bearing compartment’s near-invisible seam finally rewires the whole sanctuary, charging the closure with tangible spatial cost.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The stone arches, starlit ceiling, and acoustic properties constrain every movement and echo, shaping the climax by literally amplifying her voice. Sensory selectivity mirrors her auditory focus—canyon walls “whisper” and stone “remembers,” never generic.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glacial shrine is not mere backdrop; its “borrowed starlight” and “compressed light of centuries” charge the final image when the candles reflect in the melted globe, making the ice itself seem to hold its breath. One more sensory constraint on choice would have nudged it to 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Whispering parapet, wet stone, and bamboo whisk as micro-setting constrain Ren’s tactile choices and charge the final steam image. Selective sensory hierarchy (sound of dripping, glow of flies) mirrors theme without cataloging. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Radiant wasteland orchard, dust storms, rusted lockbox, and the diamond’s null-energy pocket are vividly specified and physically active—they dictate dig site access, storm shelter, and the choice to re-bury. However, these elements shape tactics more in retrospect than during the immediate scene; they contextualize rather than constrict the final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt portico is not mere backdrop; it channels lightning into brass mechanisms and finally refracts the new sun, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (console, tubes, pliers) constrains Cassian’s precise, minute adjustments under pressure. Weather evolves from lashing storm to parting clouds, causally linked to his act. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—he hears static others dismiss.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sand-scoured shipwreck loft and dawn whistle are sharply etched; the salt air and creaking beams physically dictate quiet movement and frame the final release of the song. Sensory specifics steer choices (stealth in drifts, low lamp over box) and charge the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drift-ice marina is not backdrop; its groans and shifting plates physically constrain Kaelen’s tactics and charge the final image of “soft, clicking harmony.” Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered. One hairline slip: “fleshly ethereal” momentarily lifts register above the rest.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and rain-beaded viaduct are rendered with selective sensory detail that constrains action (cold limits movement, magnetic stone channels energy).

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tunnel’s wet concrete, rusted pipes, and metallic echo are selective and purposeful, guiding Elara’s discovery and constraining her exit. The lantern itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image. No orientation drift; spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The antique shop is vivid—lemon polish, disemboweled music boxes, single bulb—yet it never constrains choice; it’s atmosphere more than obstacle. Micro-setting of brass heart-as-body works better: its bent pivot arm literally blocks motion. Sunbeam through storm glass is a charged final image that reweights the heart’s glow. Meets 9+ gate only on the heart-as-object, not the shop.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.4)
    Acid sea and grinding workshop are pressure sources, not wallpaper: gears literally push them ahead of decay, acidic scent alters crew posture. Setting constrains tactics and feeds the frequency hunt.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    The humming archive-body, the patch’s felt weave, and the ghosted song-echoes are tactile and selective; they charge the final absence rather than decorate it. Coordinates in petabytes and “glow of screens” fulfill orientation by ~120 words; no prop or setting detail later constrains a choice on its own, so it stays vivid but one notch below gate.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes” is vivid, selective, and immediately grounds stakes; the orchard’s light and the grinding floes constrain every choice.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Amber Pavilion’s “translucent panels that glow like a captive sunset,” the cold ripe fruit, and ash caught on “a breeze that smelled of earth” all charge the final image. Setting actively mirrors and constrains Elara’s stance—the vineyard demands patient return rather than frantic bloom. Object as micro-setting—the burned edge—anchors closure and avoids static postcarding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marble columns’ hum, heat-haze shimmer, and kinetic parapet are vivid, selective, and constrain tactics: the parapet’s gears literally shift the dune. Micro-setting (warm sand under hand) charges the final sealing. Sensory hierarchy narrows to skin prickle and distant saddle-creak under rising pressure. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from pavilion to clearing to sinking pearl.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly drawn and filter through Elara’s perception; the scent and color actively contrast decay.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Lunar observatory, telescope housing, quartzglass, and the spinning clock are lived-in tools constraining stance and finale. Sensory priority shifts under crisis: metallic groans override perpetual hum; sight narrows to the dying Earth silhouette. Environment sculpted so the mechanism’s trigger must be an external “leaf-fall” analog—non-negotiable pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hospice room is sketched with spare, sensory strokes—“antiseptic,” “sunlight on a windowsill”—that constrain Elara’s choices. The broken vinyl functions as micro-setting, its sharp edge grounding her resolve. The imagined porch-swing haven is rendered through sound and scent, charging the final image. No spatial drift; anchors are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    The nocturnal observatory isn’t scenery; its low sun and dim star-charts physically determine the shadow puzzle and the automaton’s calibration. Micro-setting details—thin cold air, star-globe with hidden key—become tools that pressure how Elara works and what she can retrieve.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.1)
    The garden’s iron-weeping fountain and oak-door constrain the rescue path; sensory detail is selective and filtered through Aris’s historian gaze. Spatial choreography is clean—needle-thin gap, cradle of roots, woven branches. The mirrored twilight world is sketched with just enough specificity to feel sharper, not generic. Micro-setting (tooth, sticks, linen) functions as charged objects that alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The serpentine grotto, mist, and sea glass form a micro-setting that constrains every beat: darkness demands touch, dampness slows polishing, the curved walls trap and amplify the revealed light. Sensory selection is POV-filtered and purposeful; the grotto’s final gleam charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    Environment (data-moss hall) constrains the choices: seclusion enables the scene and the drip pattern literally carves the map Elara sees. Sensory hierarchy reflects her watchful state—silent servers, emerald vines, honeyed drip rhythms—each detail filters POV bias and charges the final hush. No spatial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The peat, salt air, and coiling mist are selective and POV-filtered; the spiral shell functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows under crisis—mist “like a living thing” mirrors Kaelen’s mental fog. No static cataloging; every detail either pressures or reflects. Could edge higher if the outcrop rock had one tactile beat.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    The arbor’s hush, dew, and moon-filtered canopy are selective and sensory; the brass sphere and withered vine function as micro-settings that constrain choice. Final image of moonlight-threaded history charges the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crater’s bowl, skeletal apple trees, and perpetual twilight are not backdrop but pressure—silence thick enough to hold breath, cold that dictates slow, reverent motion. The rusted tripod and spherical alembic are micro-settings that physically constrain her reach and timing. These details charge the final image: the orchard’s shadows merge with the glowing map, environment becoming text.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The marble cavern is not backdrop but active constraint: its quartz veins guide light paths, its fissures birth the final note. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—Elara notices acoustic shifts before visual grandeur. One nit: “metallic dust from some far-off calamity” is evocative but floats unanchored; still, it does not derail spatial coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Bronze grotto is rendered through tactile detail and metallic light; the lamp’s flame and the calcifying wall become micro-settings that constrain action. Sensory selection is urgent—cold, damp, metallic—mirroring Elara’s internal state. Spatial tracking is flawless; no floating rooms. The grotto’s starlit shimmer charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    The skylight loft, ash blank, and kettle form a micro-setting that actively constrains choice: the kettle’s hiss is the literal clock, the loft’s isolation enables controlled grief, the blank becomes the vessel. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered (linseed oil, sawdust ghosts). The rain-beaded glass returns in the final image, recharging the earlier grey murmur into refracted light. Missing the 9+ gate only because the loft itself does not physically impede or enable the carving act beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lagoon’s arrested motion and the camera wheel’s micro-crystals constrain every beat; the frozen carousel literally prevents escape. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through Elara’s scavenger gaze. The final image recharges the “fractured stillness,” satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    The terminal’s corpse-cold tiles, fractured dome, and dripping conduit are filtered through Elara’s engineer gaze, constraining every move. The sextant itself becomes micro-setting, its brass arc guiding body placement and tool use. Sensory hierarchy is tight—ozone, condensation, starlight—each cue tied to choice. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cathedral’s glacial hush and crystal forecourt are not backdrop; they constrain Elara’s movements and literally feed the bear. Sensory detail is selective, filtered through her professional gaze, and the setting evolves as rainwater channels shift. The final image fuses body, tool, and place into one resonant constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    “Twilight barge canal,” body-object details (sundial to tapestry), and sensory restraint create a micro-setting that pressures action without ornamental excess. Some spatial anchors (warehouse jut, crippled oak) feel inserted rather than lived-in.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.9)
    Golden dock under snow functions as micro-setting that melts/re-freezes, steering tactile choices; fulgurite and rope fibers become texture-environment. Fog as oceanic hush deepens closure without over-describing.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden’s autumn decay is not backdrop; its skeletal birch and skittering leaves mirror the Countess’s emotional bareness and physically host the carpet-thread revelation. Weather (first cold raindrops) forces the interview’s end and marks the cost. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible positions. The carpet itself functions as micro-setting that constrains the Countess’s memory and Elias’s task.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.8)
    The suspended brass-and-silver palace is not backdrop but pressure: its ticking, humming sterility is the antagonist Kaelen must overcome. The fossilized egg functions as micro-setting, constraining the final design and charging the last image. Sensory selection is urgent—oil, steam, mist, vacuum hiss—filtered through Kaelen’s exhausted priorities. One detail short of 9+: the palace itself could have physically impeded the final connection.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Obsidian lagoon, black sand, and driftwood shards are not backdrop; they are surgical tools that constrain graft choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—volcanic grit under fingernails, kelp-drift hush—mirroring internal state without overt symbolism. One micro-setting slip: “kelp-drift peace” is slightly generic, but the lagoon’s mirror-sky specificity compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.9)
    The City of Forgotten Fountains is not backdrop but antagonist: every dry basin and cracked cherub withholds the memory Elara seeks. The stained glass box, the lion pedestal, and the shifting constellations are micro-settings that physically constrain her tactics and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The tidal obsidian ridge is not backdrop but active antagonist: its groan and spiteful tides pressure Silas’s task. Micro-setting of brass gears and scarred wood constrains every adjustment. Final image of moonlit, peacefully glistening ridge shows environment reconfigured by restored rhythm. Sensory hierarchy is POV-bound—oil scent, pendulum’s gleam—anchoring orientation early.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.7)
    Set anchors early and specific: velveteen gloom, cobalt silo, starlight beam, all tactile. The chest and tapestry directly constrain choices (decoding border threads, handling case). Minor slip: the silo functions more as evocative chamber than active spatial obstacle during the untangle beat, so misses the higher band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Obsidian spire, frozen lake, geothermal whisper bring micro-pressure via natural containment; freshwater-ice cap constraints map directly into the reactor design. Specificity overlaps stakes and inventiveness rather than mere ornament.
