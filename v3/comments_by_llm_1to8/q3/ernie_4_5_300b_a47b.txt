Environment constrains tactics (thick air, wind, rope mechanisms) and charges the final image. A few familiar similes appear (“howled like lost souls”), but overall the setting’s logic is consistent and consequential. The tool-as-setting (bell/ropes) effectively functions as a pressure device.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vivid and functional: plateau, domes, obsidian, aurora, and the crater shape movement and mood. The yellow lantern operates as micro‑setting/tool charging the final image and guiding action. World rules remain consistent and integrated through action. Atmosphere and specificity elevate theme without static cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.0)
    The emerald silo and its innards (hatch, coil, mercury) are tactile, sensorial, and integral, not postcard. The environment actively supplies constraints and resources (broken capsule, pooled stillness) that enable the key turn. Details are filtered through Elias’s priorities, maintaining atmospheric pressure. The setting charges the final image by making the surrender of the fragment meaningful in place.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lagoon after rain is vividly rendered and supplies resources and constraints (storm debris becomes material; water responds to her hum). The setting’s sensory detail aligns with Lira’s priorities and charges the final image (amber/violet water; feather in fading light). Environmental logic is consistent and integrated into action, not bolted on. The kite, heron, and fisherman enrich atmosphere without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    The temple orchard and living pillars are vividly tactile and govern tactics—the copper must bridge oak to stone; the pillar’s heartbeat cues acceptance. Setting evolves with events (rumble, glow, hum) and charges the final image. Details are POV‑filtered through Lira’s botanical craft. The environment and tools constrain choices and shape closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    The rainwashed tower, sculpture path, and “bronze quiet” are vivid and purpose-driven. The kneeling statue and its outstretched hands concretely constrain the choice and charge the final image. World rules (resonance field, amber dissolving) are taught through action, not dump. Sensory selection is precise and filtered through Lirael’s mind.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and integrated: damp sand, shell fragments, salt decay, and the jetty’s brackish edge shape tactics (“water sparingly,” bone/ash mix). Weather escalates pressure, charging the last image with approaching storm. Specificity filters through his trained attention—bird cries as soil cues—avoiding postcard description. The environment both constrains and energizes the final stance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    The scrapyard settlement and cracked wasteland are vividly selective and filtered through Hush’s sensory bias. Recurring objects (the cylinders, the waxed leaf) function as micro-setting and charge the final image. World rules (resource-scarcity, travel-as-currency) feel coherent and learned through action. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain tactics, it meaningfully inflects choices and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observation deck and corridors are vivid and functional: the dilation rules and abandoned machinery generate the glimpse and isolate him. The compass rose acts as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image. Details stay POV-filtered (scientist’s material focus) and evolve (from décor to guide). World logic holds without expo-dump sprawl.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vivid, economical worldbuilding: icebound ledge, slit window, bioluminescent fungi, and the chessboard all feel tactile and purposeful. The environment constrains access and shapes action (slick ledge, narrow entry, tremors during swaps). Recurring objects (sundial motifs) charge the final image. Sensory balance is strong without tourist‑catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The whispering gallery’s acoustics and the living chessboard are vivid and integral; sound pressures her and the board charges the final image. Detail is economical and POV-filtered (stones “questioning,” paintings leaning), avoiding museum‑tour genericness. The environment subtly shapes tactics (walking pattern, reversal) rather than serving as wallpaper. Strong object‑as‑setting work with the board constraining moves.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain‑bookstore and cavern are vivid and purposeful, with tactile objects (stone, feather) integrated into action. Environment actively pressures the climax (quake, falling rocks) and charges the final image (silver‑lit peak). Details filter through Lirael’s sensibility (mercury skin reflecting lanterns; bioluminescent fungi), avoiding postcard excess. World rules are taught through use, not dumped.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.9)
    The time‑frozen village, platinum labyrinth, and storm‑hushed square are vivid and functionally constraining; environment and recurring objects shape tactics and the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful (thunder’s lull, gleam of platinum, pulsing threads). World rules stay consistent and are learned via Alaric’s actions. The setting meaningfully charges both the midpoint (thread‑winnowing) and the ending (village reborn).

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The canyon of echoes, bone towers, and misted spire are vivid and functionally integrated: echoes carry poetry, the tower is climbed/painted, and the spire charges the final image. Details are POV‑filtered and tactile (ink seeping into bone; the hush before storm). World rules stay legible through action (chanting, refracting light). Strong environmental pressure without over‑touristing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The acid sea, copper hull, respirator, and grinding gears constrain options and charge the final image; environment and objects act as setting with consequence. Sensory detail is vivid and POV‑filtered (alchemical inventory, “vials of liquid light”). Spatial logic remains stable as gears shake loose and the sea surges. Occasional symbolic mirroring is pronounced but integrated through action rather than static tableau.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harbor and cave are vividly realized through selective sensory detail (cool air, narrowing walls, warm pool), filtered through a painter’s eye. The environment shapes choices (fork, stooping, the fissure’s light dictating where he sees and draws) and charges the final image. Recurring objects (mirror/shell/water) integrate with the place rather than float as symbols. Economy holds; no tourist-catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse, garden, dawn light, and rain are vivid and purpose‑driven; dawn “kissing” the cork and the salt‑air garden directly enable the method. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara’s priorities (herbalist, hum, scent). The setting constrains choice (height, window, light, proximity to village) and charges the final image. A hair off 9+ only because environment’s constraint is gentle rather than inescapable.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    The signal station, ocean, and censer foot are tactile and purpose-driven; she harvests materials from the station and centers the foot in the build, which charges the final image. Sensory selection fits her vocation (wires, solder, static, chants), and world rules stay consistent. The environment constrains/empowers tactics rather than serving as backdrop. A hair more pressure from the elements could have pushed this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.3)
    The orchard-in-ravine and incoming storm shape tactics (urgency to reach the oak, detour to hut) and color the mood. The glass eye as micro-setting/tool is integrated into perception and action. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful; environment mirrors stakes without over-signaling. Strong, though the storm’s physical constraint could tighten consequences even more.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Vivid, selective sensory detail (opal dock, mist, brine, rust) filtered through Elias’s sensibility creates strong atmosphere. Setting shapes action via the hidden hatch under the dock, not merely postcard texture. The boutonnière and lantern function as charged micro-setting objects that recur and reweight the final image. While constraint is present, it’s more enabling access than forcing trade-offs, keeping it just shy of 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.4)
    Vivid, economical setting—ants in double lines, ivy‑veiled mouth, bioluminescent fungi, obsidian pedestal—filtered through Lila’s sensibility. Environment guides action (ants’ path, hidden entrance, pedestal as focal constraint) and charges the final image (following the ants home). Sensory detail is purposeful and consistent. Minor reliance on familiar images (“frozen tears”) slightly tempers distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vivid, sensorial, and filtered: condensation on stone, ozone scent, “bruise” of the clouds, gravel that sparks. The ridge and slickness shape action; the grotto’s light literally pools in her hands and charges the final image. World rules are conveyed through observation and interaction, not exposition. The environment consistently mirrors and pressures her internal state without feeling schematic.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vivid, selective details (ember nexus, cooled lava shards, prismatic lens) are filtered through Elara’s professional bias and charge the final image as the nexus warms. Objects-as-setting (shell and engine) concretely shape tactics and outcome. The environment’s cold/fading heat applies soft pressure rather than hard constraints. Sensory balance and world rules remain consistent and economical.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The utility tunnel and booth are vividly tactile (damp earth, old copper, flickering bulbs) and filter perception through Mara’s priorities. The recurring object (glass harmonica disc) functions as micro‑setting and charges the final image. Environmental constraint meaningfully shapes the job’s isolation and the plausibility of payphone misdials. A slight bias toward lyric description over constraint prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The jetty, flowers, salt and jasmine, and walnut ink form a tactile, integrated atmosphere filtered through Elara’s archivist eye. The environment subtly pressures action (wind rattles the locket; the jetty’s bloom redefines ritual) and charges the final image. Rules of this slightly magical world are consistent and inferred through detail rather than explained. It’s vivid and purposeful without feeling like a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Vivid, selective details (ivy “second heartbeat,” moss‑carpeted platform, tracks vanishing) create lived atmosphere and mirror the loneliness theme without overstatement. The station/ivy are not mere backdrop; they house and signal the ghost (ivy shivers) and locate the lever where the catalyst is placed. Environmental logic remains consistent and spatially coherent. The setting pressures mood and action but only lightly constrains choice.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ultrasonic forest is sensorially specific and functionally constraining (teeth-aching thicket; Silver Vein’s inverted flow; constellations as a clock). Details are filtered through a blind tactile/haptic bias, deepening authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.7)
    The harbor is vivid and sensorially economical—moonlight, ropes, and water rhythms integrate with the act of “mapping silence.” The camera as recurring object charges the final image and helps anchor the environment’s logic. While the setting doesn’t force a decisive choice, it shapes the ritual and tone. Specificity stays within scene needs without touring.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archive’s rooms and materials (acid burns, astronomical maps, forgotten languages) feel tactile and purposeful. Setting and objects are not backdrop; they enable choices and charge the final image through the portrait’s transformation. Detail selection tracks Mara’s priorities and maintains mood. While constraint is more thematic than logistical, it’s still integral.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vivid, sensorial, and integrated; environment materially participates (plants hum/sway, lagoon intensifies in response to drumming). Details filter through Eli’s bias and actions, not a tourist catalog. The setting charges the final image and offers resources/constraints tied to vibration. A touch more constraint (e.g., a trade‑off enforced by the garden’s rules) could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    The container labyrinth, ozone‑tanged storm air, flickering lights, and vibrating metal are vivid and purpose‑driven, constraining tactics (silence, listening, symbol‑reading).

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful: the lens groove in the console teaches world rules; the cave acts as instrument; equations on walls bridge lab and cavern. Sensory detail (golden shadows, damp earth, vibration through bones) is selective and in-character. The environment constrains tactics—the lens as key and the cave’s acoustics dictate action—and charges the final image. Scale and spatial choreography are coherent across the two shards.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.8)
    The observatory, lanterns, and glass dome are vivid and functionally integrated: they enable and constrain the ritual (alignment, projection, visibility for miles). Tools and materials (meteorite iron, vellum, mirrors) filter through Elias’s craft‑mind. The final image of the beaconed dome and pendant returns setting objects as charged closures. Minor risk of lushness never obscures spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.6)
    The loft and skylight are vivid and tactically used (lay cards where raindrops fall; skylight as lens/prism). The measuring tape functions as micro‑setting, constraining attention through distances and reprise at the end. Weather affects method and atmosphere rather than being a postcard backdrop. World rules feel consistent and filtered through Elara’s analytic–mystic bias.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vivid and POV‑filtered (bronze prism pagoda, constellations, glowing carvings) and charges the final image (liquid gold pooled at her feet).

Environment meaningfully colors tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “misty courtyard above clouds” and the storm aren’t postcard detail; weather, stone, and the wall’s “ghost in code” integrate with action. The flower press bolt plate functions as a micro‑setting object that charges the final image via the bluebell. Sensory detail is selective and voice‑filtered, maintaining tone without clutter. Constraint is mostly atmospheric rather than tactical, keeping this just shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Vivid, purposeful setting: the icebound spire, elevator, and scattered light shape perception and meaning rather than decorate. Tools-as-setting (goggles) and micro‑environment (frosted glass, veins in ice) directly constrain what can be seen and thus chosen. The final threshold image is charged by place. A small increase in environmental constraint on action (not just vision) would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    The gondola, brass telescope, lanterns, and cloud typologies create a vivid, coherent environment filtered through a meteorologist’s bias. Setting lightly constrains choices (string snapped, thermal lurches, drifting) and charges the final image. Sensory economy is strong without touristic cataloging. The object‑as‑setting (telescope) returns meaningfully at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)

Sensory specificity is selective and character-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Setting is vivid and functional: cold, frost, and mirror logic shape tactics; the “reflection that did not belong” is a spatial rule that governs access. Objects (vial, crescent lock, runed gears) are integrated and the environment charges the ending’s renewed brightness and ticking clock. Sensory detail is selective and POV‑filtered. It stops short of a hard constraint with a price, but it’s strongly embedded.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Luminara’s orchards, floating arches, and the nebula are vivid and purpose‑driven, not postcard filler. The arches’ decay directly motivates the plan, and the bell returns to charge the final image. World rules stay coherent and are learned through action. Atmosphere aligns with tone without bogging momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    The lighthouse, cliff, fog, and pane are vivid and purposeful; sensory choices are filtered through a mechanic’s eye and salt-heavy air. The pane functions as micro-setting/tool that constrains choices and charges the ending image. World rules (fractal glass translating song) are learned in action, not dumped. Minor note: the lighthouse itself pressures less than the pane, but the mood scaffolding is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    The environment and recurring object constrain choices: birds actively patrol and threaten punishment; frost clock presses; the fountain and hidden door shape tactics; the nut functions as micro‑setting/tool. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Kael’s bias (discordant birdsong, sap “like blood”). World rules are learned via action rather than dump. Final images (frost glazing, roots thrumming) charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    The braided ravine and foam are vivid, professionally filtered, and central to meaning; setting details are selective and purposeful.

A single spatial slip: the control panel’s “faint buzz” after years of abandonment strains plausibility, a hairline nick.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.1)
    Raft-city grit is vivid, selective: diesel-fried air, drowning-clown mural, gilded barge. The chip and graffiti act as micro-settings that constrain tactics; spatial choreography is clean across the Alley and tower plaza.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    The moonlit summit is vividly sketched—“silver path through the dust,” “cold silence softened”—and the crater’s sharp rim constrains the placement of the vial. Earth’s crescent on the horizon mirrors the loneliness, but the setting never physically impedes or enables her action beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mist, depot, and basin function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the mist limits visibility, the basin’s refracted light becomes Lira’s diagnostic tool. The anchor lift’s creaks supply a temporal metronome. Details are filtered through Lira’s tactile POV, never touristic. The basin’s glow charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.2)
    Frosted window, rusted outpost, and glowing ice shard all constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective—pine-resin cigarette, hissing stove—anchoring POV bias without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stone, bell-tower, cobblestones, and tuning fork are tactile and specific; the fork’s vibration charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean, though broader geography beyond the square is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The red stone corridors, cracked pedestal, and returning tide pools are selective, tactile, and mirrored in Lira’s body (raw fingers, glowing pocket). The labyrinth’s pulse constrains her path and supplies the literal canvas for sewing. A hairline slip: “the canyon had no sky” slightly blurs temporal anchoring, but the final reflection in the tide pools recharges the setting as closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    Catacomb orchard root-bones, incense, murals, all vivid and selective; the sundial pedestal matches shape with cinematic precision. Environment subtly guides motion—roots coil, spring appears—acting as active micro-settings rather than backdrop. No setting element constrains final choice directly; glow on walls is atmospheric, not tactical brake. Still, consistency across senses grounds reader in world rules without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arcade’s refracted dawn light and solar-gel fountain actively constrain tactics: Lira must read light spectra to locate the compartment.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    The opal library above clouds is sketched with prismatic light and stained-glass shelves that fracture into “whispers,” anchoring the fantastical without over-cataloguing. The cracked bamboo tube and the orchids’ petals serve as micro-settings that directly constrain Lirael’s choices—she must work within the tube’s remaining resonance and the orchids’ humidity needs. Weather (last night’s storm) and spatial choreography (kneeling at the apex, stepping to the library’s edge) track cleanly. One minor slip: “auroras” feels like a generic placeholder rather than a specific sky phenomenon.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive’s dust, mothball scent, and sagging shelves are filtered through Elara’s obsessive focus, constraining her movements and pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The volcano-amphitheater is sensuously alive—“molten-red stone,” “breathing arches”—and the surveyor’s chain functions as micro-setting that constrains her decryption process. Spatial choreography is tight; every click of the chain anchors us. The environment’s breath directly times the climax, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.0)
    The attic’s skylight, dust motes, and pigeon cages constrain every move: Elias maps dust because the room’s geometry limits perspective. Sensory detail is selective—sunflower seed, wood polish, tape hiss—and filtered through his obsessions. The setting quietly guides the final choice: leaving the attic means leaving the only map he has.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prism terrace’s refracted hush and shifting corn compass-needles are vivid, selective, and pressure-relevant; the final disappearance of the terrace reconfigures the visual motif into loss. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from terrace to maze heart to field edge.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    The grotto’s moss, mist, and color-shifted sky are vivid and selective, but the setting never physically constrains her choices; it’s atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical obstacle. Micro-setting (the silk lattice) does charge the final image, lifting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The sanctum’s ice, rope, and aurora are not just atmosphere; they exert literal pressure (cold that numbs scarred fingers, rope mechanism that dictates speed).

Micro-setting (the shell in his pocket) functions as extension of body and memory. Spatial choreography is clean; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    Cobalt tower staging is concrete and reactive: rain scents the air, salt streaks guide Elara’s footfalls, vial glass captures dawn. The lighthouse garden doubles as climatic bell-lute, mirroring internal vibration; removing it guts the sound palette and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Station hull scrap metal, body-temperature censer, and moonlit salt mist pressure her tactics; micro-setting (tool, body) constrains assembly. Despite broad strokes, specifics anchor geography and sharpen choreography under pressure. No white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ravine orchard is vivid—branches “bent low under the weight of truffles,” boots sinking in damp soil—and the storm actively narrows choices, forcing the hut retreat. Micro-setting (glass eye, ledger) constrains tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    The opal dock’s mist and salt-slick planks constrain movement and hide the hatch, directly enabling the discovery. Sensory detail is selective—bruise-purple sky, cobweb mist—and filtered through Elias’s maritime gaze. The Edelweiss reappears in the final image, charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Setting is selective and sensory: “emerald shards” of light, “frozen tears” of stalactites. The cavern’s bioluminescent fungi and obsidian pedestal constrain her path and frame the final image. Micro-setting (chip in palm) charges closure; no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Vivid, sensory terrain (“cobalt grotto…bruise beneath her feet,” “pooling in her palms like liquid silver”) anchors POV attention and steers footing decisions; ember-lit walls actively constrain movement and perception during climax.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.1)
    The floating rock, mist, and forest canopy are rendered with selective sensory economy; the platform’s tremor and the mist’s parting directly constrain Kael’s next step, charging the closure. Micro-setting (the obsidian cups, the quill) functions as tactile extensions of interior stakes. No spatial drift or white-room gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Archive dust “smelled of regret,” piano keys “yellowed with age,” chainsaws waiting “as if for a signal”—selective sensory triangulation anchors mood and stakes. The orchard outside functions as looming deadline, but the archive itself does not physically constrain choices beyond atmosphere; hence capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.1)
    Library atmosphere breathes with tactile specificity ("aged paper," "resounding hush") and the blank dictionary on last pedestal anchors the final image; however, spatial choreography between corridors fades, keeping it below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    The station’s salt-streaked walls, the mirrored fjord, and the brass mechanism’s hiss are selective and POV-filtered.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    Observatory’s rusted telescopes, cracked dome, and moonlit stone constrain Elias’s every step; the stencil’s alignment with constellations physically links grief to cosmos. Lantern-lenses, cracked glass beams, and stardust vials are not backdrop but instruments that guide the ritual. Final image of beacon light slicing rural night demonstrates setting actively reconfigured to serve closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rain-beaded skylight loft is not mere backdrop; its glass drips constrain where cards can be laid and its refracted light literally reveals “cracks in the city’s mask,” charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean; weather guides every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.1)
    The bronze prism’s reflections, dust motes, and serpent carving are filtered through Lirael’s biased gaze; the pagoda’s glow finally pools like liquid gold at her feet, constraining her next step and charging the ending. Spatial anchors are clear; micro-setting (her palm on warm bronze) functions as setting.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The blooming library above clouds is rendered with selective, sensory precision; the petrified-petal shelves and glass dome constrain visibility and mood, while the river stone’s shifting veins act as micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.4)
    The misty workshop under stars is more than backdrop; its cold glass, skylight starlight, and dawn lifting mist mirror and constrain Lira’s choices. The terrarium and tools function as micro-setting that physically shapes the reconstruction beats. One step short of 9.0 because the broader geography (pines, wildlife show) is sketched rather than leveraged for choice.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.9)
    The tower’s damp stone and ivy roots constrain movement and whisper intel; the scar itself becomes micro-setting that guides choice. Selective sensory detail (frost crackling in teeth, coffee-ring edges browned) supports urgency. Final image of dawn light reframes the tower from crypt to threshold. Environment does not merely backdrop but shapes the descent and return.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Projection booth environment is texture-dense via dust motes, rotary reels, and lilac scent; it supplies the splice kit and primer room that enable the final splice act. Micro-setting pressure alters tactics as Mara’s knee knocks the splice tool to realign the cut.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    The aurora-lit archway and sextant function as micro-setting that constrains choice: only their alignment opens the chamber. Sensory detail is selective—ozone taste, frost-prickle—filtered through Kael’s synesthetic bias. One minor spatial blur: the exact distance between arch and chamber isn’t tracked, but the dissolve into sky repairs orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Bioluminescent sand and crystalline towers are vivid and selective; the dune’s pulse constrains Kael’s footing and later erupts into light at climax. Spatial choreography is coherent; the chess clock functions as micro-setting that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mechanical Rainforest pulses through gear-leaf hybrids, steam-veins, and tone-rich wind; every sensory choice feeds the theme. The revelatory clearing acts as micro-setting that constrains the final action: once gear is locked, rotation forces forest-brain shift; gear’s leaving charges closure. All world rules track cleanly; selectivity economy rewarded.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    The ridgeway’s mutable geography is vivid and selective—salt-iron air, vanishing paths—yet it never physically constrains a choice; the setting remains atmospheric rather than tactical. Micro-setting (the mossy stone for the punch) does charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible moves.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    Cobalt walls, frozen mercury, moonlight cloth, and the piano bench create a tactile micro-setting that constrains action (bench must be steady for music to heal). Details are filtered through Elric’s caretaker gaze; the bolt and bench return in the closure image, charging the final note. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    Setting functions as pressure system: the “ancient… air hummed,” “walls bore carvings,” “mosaic of stars” trapdoor are not backdrop; each constrains path and signals knowledge. Economy is strong—three focused settings (library aisle, hidden chamber, revealed sky) with tactile specificity (ink pellet cold in hand). Temple geography is internally coherent; star-map mosaic as tactile lock plate tightens final image.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    Station, atoll, and bioluminescent storm are rendered in selective sensory strokes that mirror Lira’s urgency; the atlas page and tapping rhythms act as micro-settings that constrain choices. The final reef image charges the closing beat, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.1)
    Spaceport bay is tactile—rusted cranes, half-buried drones, cool floor under bare feet—and the stone circle’s hum constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to vibration and wind, charging the ending image with ozone and iron.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.6)
    Volcanic hot springs are rendered with tactile heat, sulfurous scent, and moss-slick rock; the setting actively constrains digging time (“before the drones return”) and supplies the womb-like cradle for the embryo. Final image of glowing water recharges the opening steam.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Arboretum, cliff, salt wind, and lavender sprig are not backdrop; the stone bench literally steadies Lila’s hand and the salt scent cues the somatic anchor. Micro-setting (bench, pocket, coat) constrains the final choice. Sensory hierarchy is POV-biased: painter’s eye for texture, PTSD-narrowed hearing. Weather (gust that rattles gates) triggers flashback, then is re-inscribed as neutral stimulus. Spatial choreography clean; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.1)
    The library-lighthouse is evoked with salt-rot, warped spines, and stolen lens; these details constrain Elias’s movement and supply the thread material. Micro-setting (thread in box crack, candle at stair summit) directly shapes the final composition. One minor drift: “gap where the sea should be” is atmospheric but not spatially anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sand, wind, fading eclipse light, drone wings, disappearing ink, and the child’s scratched circles are vivid, selected, and tied to choice (ink patterns are read, the drone’s hologram anchors next move). Micro-setting objects (vial, drone) constrain options and charge the final image; no over-descriptive stall.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    The echoing, snow-burdened library is vivid, selective, and thematically apt; frost and silence act as active pressure. Micro-setting (cryo-chamber glass, ice blooming under palm) constrains the pivotal choice. Spatial choreography is clean. A touch more sensory narrowing under stress would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.4)
    Selective, sensory-rich grounding—“petals unfurling in the artificial breeze,” “glass refracting…a thousand shades of fire”—establishes the dome’s containment as operative constraint. The roses, sand, and dome all recur to weight Lira’s final choice; setting constrains tactics and charges closure. Only the off-page sandstorm remains decorative rather than generative.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sound wave garden remains tactile and specific; emitter, spikes, and crystal trees constrain every tactic. Sensory economy is vivid (warm-hued ripples underfoot) and consistently filtered through Kael’s fisher-mechanic eye. The garden itself co-defines the final image, just shy of 8.8 only because first spatial anchor is slightly slow.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.9)
    The echoing, gear-driven observatory supplies micro-pressure (isolation, secrecy) and its rosewood desk doubles as "setting" that charges choices. Density is high but slightly unbalanced—visual dominates, acoustics underused.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.1)
    The laboratory’s ozone-regret air and fractal amber light are selective and purposeful, guiding Lira’s attention to the insect-key. The nursery shard functions as micro-setting, its empty crib constraining her choice to kneel and read. Spatial choreography is coherent; no white-room drift. Environment could have tightened tactics further inside the firmware maze.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto’s tactility—damp moss, hovering flake, breathing silence—constrains every move; fog complicates depth perception and the acoustic chamber governs choice of silence vs. speech. Palette evokes mood while the tile’s lilac light explicitly charges the final projection. Occasional mist-as-skin cliché is offset by integrated sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    The plaza, minaret shadow, and tessera texture constrain Elias’s movement and charge the final image; the stepping stone literally guides his act of renaming. Selective sensory detail (ash, ozone, chipped glaze) filters through his retrocognitive bias. No spatial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    The orchard-hedge maze is tactile and synesthetic; apples taste of “autumn twilight,” gravel hums minor key. Setting constrains tactics: maze paths rearrange to the coin’s design, enabling the final convergence. Micro-setting (coin as anchor) charges the closure. A few phrases drift toward postcard lushness but never stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    Neon-blue ligature, ozone, acrylic scent, hologram projections tether reader to the cramped studio; spatial and tool use track cleanly as Elias manipulates geode and rig. Environment does not merely stage but actively supplies resources (static rig, prismatic light) that enable the final alignment beat—yet lacks full atmospheric pressure that would push choice.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.0)
    The coastal cave is rendered through touch, scent, and tool interaction; the damp sand, brine gust, and bioluminescent algae all constrain how Lira moves and sees.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.1)
    Silver hush, mist-clung cliff, frost-kissed gravel—details are selective and filtered through Mara’s tactical eye. The bluff’s isolation directly enables the vouchsafe act; the setting constrains choice by muffling sound and eavesdropping, charging the final image as she descends into “a sliver of sunlight.”

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.7)
    Fog, ticking gutters, and the creaking hull are vivid and selective, filtering through Thaddeus’s professional attention. The yarn needle functions as micro-setting, but it never constrains a choice; it merely accompanies reflection. Environment guides mood, not tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.6)
    The skeletal hives, rusted pump, and improbable sunflowers are filtered through Mara’s potter-eye (“soil clings to life like clay on a wheel”), constraining her method and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and light over cataloguing. Micro-setting—the lantern glass itself—functions as portable oasis.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Harbor moonlight, salt diesel, iron fire-escape groans, jasmine and geranium texture—all felt through Elias’s gardener perceptions, never staged as exposition. The bitting gauge tooth serves as micro-setting handled at pulse and fingertip across beats. Spatial anchor is immediate; only a slight dip under 8 reflects the fairly expected moon-dock palette rather than a constraining surprise.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tidal library is rendered with tactile specificity—coral walls, shifting floors, moon-breath shelves—and the sundial’s brass surface constrains Lirael’s final choice by literally glowing with the spiral. Every detail is filtered through her perception and feeds the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.1)
    The lotus temple and pond are rendered with selective sensory detail; the glass orbs floating at dusk become the micro-setting that constrains Lila’s choice. The environment’s prismatic quiet modulates with the stakes, charging the final image as the orbs sink and the water “rippl[es] like liquid light.”

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sub-basement maze of cables and green-wave screens is tightly filtered through Lila’s need to “sync her laptop to the transmitter”; the gear physically constrains body movement and tactic (kneeling beside oscilloscopes). Outside quad and “hum of the transmitter” anchor time and place early. Only minor redundancy: “relics from when radio was the only link” restates transmitter vibe without fresh gain—nips 0.2 from top band.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.1)
    Stone, starlight, and shifting corridor walls are vividly filtered through Elias’s urgency; the compass and organ act as micro-settings that constrain tactics, though the cathedral’s larger geography remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Mist-clung quarry walls, charcoal grit on lenses, and lantern-shadow geometry constrain Clara’s perceptual choices and charge the final portrait. Sensory hierarchy reflects her face-blind bias toward texture and shadow. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from easel to pit to locket spot. The quarry’s tomb-like atmosphere mirrors internal stakes without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    The brass dials, frosted glass, and salt-ozone air are filtered through Clara’s map-librarian gaze, constraining her path (only the eastern tower soil is soft enough to dig). The spongey gray sky and sickly green climax charge the final image, but the station’s interior layout remains slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.6)
    The pullout’s resin-and-oil scent and the van’s glovebox anchor us quickly; the mountains “rising like ancient sentinels” mirror Elias’s watchfulness. Micro-setting (the flake in palm) constrains the final act, but the environment itself does not tighten tactics—more backdrop than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The abandoned circus train is vividly sketched—“ivy and the last light of day”—and its decay mirrors the startup’s collapse. Yet the train never constrains Elias’s choices; it’s backdrop, not obstacle or tool. Specificity is strong, functional use is moderate.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The observatory’s frosted dome, brass sextant, and prism constrain choices and charge the final image; the temple hologram’s mosaic floor grounds the climax. Sensory selection is urgent and POV-filtered, though “silver moth trapped in amber” edges ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    Orchard described with tactile vortex pressure; flesh-eating plant acts as micro-setting that charges final image—supports rather than stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt glade’s “heather” and “condensed time” walls are selective and purposeful; the clipped topiary literally becomes part of Lirael’s body, charging the final image. Spatial anchors are clear by line 5. While evocative, the Glass Labyrinth’s reappearance is more atmospheric than constraining; it doesn’t limit tactics until the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    Catacomb orchard is vivid, selective, and purposeful: torchlight, bioluminescent fungi, bone-fed roots all constrain movement and echo internal decay. The skeleton beneath the final tree functions as micro-setting that literally supports the stitching act. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure—soft earth on knees, heartbeat in fruit. One minor drift: “amber and violet” sky at exit feels postcard after the subterranean specificity, but it serves as tonal release.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    Trailer’s mildew, desk-lamp flicker, and granite chasm ground every beat; the cloth itself serves as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Sensory selection skews visual; one missed tactile return to rain-soaked boots after Gus exits.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The magnetic arbor is rendered with tactile specificity (“iron roots coiled through the stratosphere,” “lodestone leaves hummed”); the setting actively constrains Elara’s method—she must work within the magnetic lattice—and the final image of shifting roots recharges the opening stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    Crystal throb and obsidian shards are vivid, selective; setting constrains via slippery floor and light-flare, but absence of spatial detail during spiral pass makes choreography shaky. Environment charges final image through illuminated shadows; succeeds as crystallized cathedral without over-cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    The station’s damp rust, ivy-choked arches, and sluggish tributary are selective, POV-filtered, and constrain choices (ivy preserves graffiti, drainpipe leads to water). The accordion’s warm bellows functions as micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. One minor redundancy: “disused railway station smelled of damp earth and rust” could trim “damp.”

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Glowing mist shelves and humming watch are vivid and tightly filtered through Lira, but environment never physically obstructs or wounds—no shelf crumbles, no shadow chills. Micro-setting remains atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint that scars the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
