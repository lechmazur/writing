Micro-setting (seed-wrapping paper) doubles as ancestral archive, constraining her method and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating arch-water inversion world is tactile from the first sentence; magnetic anchors gripping ceiling-rock under reversed gravity show environment constraining action. Sensory hierarchy suits urgency—Kessa notices warmth of metal, rush of spiral water, silence that “presses…like frozen waterfalls in reverse.” Each detail feeds the dominant imagery of graceful defiance rather than tourism. The setting itself delivers the final, wordless answer.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Port labyrinth is both obstacle and magnetic map: containers lean, bend, fingerprint wind. Micro-settings (digits, anemometer, disturbed coins) constrain every footfall and tighten spatial pressure. Metallic scent and dust under fingernails root the esoteric in sweat and rust.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ice cavern as instrument is richly specific—each bubble a “frozen note”—and directly constrains the climax: the walls must resonate for the aurora to descend. Spatial choreography is tight; the setting is both stage and co-performer.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    “Avalanchingly quiet mountains” and shimmering winter-heat canyon become felt constraints; driftwood markers track movement while silence itself becomes an active presence pressing eardrums, guiding the final image toward the seed exchange.

Only the faintest excess of visual layering keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    “Aurora’s green ribbons,” “weathered vertebra humming,” and pendant vibration against her collar offer sensory micro-setting that actively limits tactics—every tremor channels the harmonic. Coherent but not yet constraining future choice; hence capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bamboo-ruined orchard is more than backdrop; its encroaching stalks physically constrain movement and acoustically amplify the raveling silence that makes transmission possible. The amber bead itself becomes micro-setting, a luminous prison that anchors the loom and charges the final bead formed from Mei’s tears.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Floating stone arches and drifting cherry blossoms are not backdrop; they model the planet’s negotiated gravity and foreshadow Korin’s refusal to “fall” as failure. The abandoned mine shaft’s thin-reality chambers constrain forging method—intention shapes metal—charging the final blade. Sensory selection (cooling iron, impossible silk colors) stays urgent to the task. Environment, tool, and body converge in the charged image of blossoms “falling upward.”

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Repair bay iterations are sharply particularized—bioluminescent fungi, sideways gravity, underwater bubbles—each filtering through Kira’s synesthetic lens. The bay-as-nexus finally constrains the choice to mend rather than roam. Micro-settings (shard, nexus threads) likewise guide tactics. Sensory overload is disciplined to urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The impossible library above a train station is sketched with selective sensory cues (crumpled paper, telegram creases) that constrain choices—secrecy demands silence, architecture allows hidden corners. Micro-setting (table between them) becomes the charged space where distance is negotiated. One stray: “impossible architecture” is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The jasmine hedge, thornrose gap, and candle-lit tea house are rendered with sensory economy; the palace wall and ghost-echo birds constrain Lila’s path and charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.1)
    Lavender bluff, boreal forest, and aurora are not backdrop but active agents: electromagnetic pulses from root networks force Marina’s implants to strobe, the spruce “transmits” coordinates, and the aurora responds like neural fire. Micro-setting (tin ring on tongue) constrains every beat. Spatial choreography stays clean as figures converge from distinct vectors. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—copper-sweet north, aluminum-southwest—anchoring orientation without cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The crystal cave is more than backdrop; its acoustic and tactile properties literally enable the climactic act of drawing on stone. Spatial anchors are immediate, sensory range is balanced, and the setting constrains the final choice. A hairline slip: the “cathedral of stone” phrase edges toward grandeur not yet earned.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Greenhouse city is rendered with tactile immediacy—“sweating condensation that smelled of copper and regret”—and the micro-setting of junction seven’s crystallized message wall constrains choice. Spatial cues remain coherent across the maintenance crawl; the toxic sky hovers as persistent external threat without becoming scenery.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)

The dice as micro-setting object charges the final image when it glows and reveals engravings. Spatial choreography is coherent; no impossible positions. One minor over-description: “shafts of green-filtered sunlight that danced across Maya’s shoulders” could lose “danced” without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The salt-crystal chamber, cemetery gravity pockets, and lantern flames are vivid, selective, and directly constrain Marina’s movements and choices. The whale’s body functions as macro-setting that warps micro-settings. Final lantern image recharges earlier motifs. No spatial drift.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nocturnal haven is not backdrop but instrument: stones, reeds, brook-mist all recruited to muffle destiny. Micro-setting (the flat stone, the brook’s murmur) constrains every tactical choice. Final image of morning light “brighter but somehow less real” recharges the setting’s transformation. One minor redundancy: “terrestrially cosmic twin” is vivid but slightly self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    The rooftop garden, meteor shower, and antique seal function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the open sky invites cosmic scale while the seal’s brass weight tethers Elara to human time.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The feral loft, salt-stiffened blanket, and warped boards function as micro-setting that constrains Marcus’s hermit life and later welcomes visitors. The music box’s worn carousel horses and Elena's bench are tactile, selective, and mirrored in the final jar. Sensory detail is filtered through Marcus’s collector’s bias. Weather and spatial choreography remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drift-ice marina is tactile—groaning platforms, frozen rivets, honey-blood sunset—and the lighthouse itself constrains every move, culminating in the beam that now carries Mira’s song. Micro-setting (vault door, suspension field) directly shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Basalt columns glazed with ice, moonlit reflections, and the magnetic hum under Kira’s palm create a tactile micro-setting that constrains every step and tool placement. Weather and freeze are not backdrop but clock and crucible. The sanctuary’s geometry literally guides the circuit she builds; remove the setting and the entire mechanism fails.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tunnel’s damp acoustics, brass lantern, and rain drumming above are selective and pressure-driven. The lantern functions as micro-setting that constrains the final choice. One over-tidy echo: “the drought had broken above ground” restates the rain without fresh sensory gain.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shop’s brass, dust motes, and fractured light constrain mood and echo the broken heart; the music boxes serve as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial anchors arrive early; weather shifts mirror internal states without cliché. Light through storm clouds is integrated, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The gears-and-cogs workshop, acid sea, and kaleidoscope apparatus are rendered with selective sensory density that constrains choice: the acid limits flight paths, the workshop chains restrain Pioneer until the final leap. Micro-setting—the arrow tip under lenses—functions as crucible. Environmental details evolve causally; acid reacts with etched brass to produce new light spectra. One missed beat: exact spatial relation between workshop pontoons and bay door is vague, preventing 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    The archive’s “towers of obsolete servers” and the maintenance elevator anchor space early; the Apollo-X patch returns in the final image to charge the transformation. Micro-setting (the jacket against her chest) constrains the last choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.8)
