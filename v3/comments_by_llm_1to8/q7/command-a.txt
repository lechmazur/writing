  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose clarity suffers from abstract phrasing and conceptual loops. "Gradual change" and variants appear five times; "decay" six times. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("It was as if..." appears twice; "She had begun to..." twice). The butterfly emergence paragraph contains three filter constructions in succession, dulling immediacy during the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Several template phrases weaken momentum: "her mind racing with plans," "renewed determination," "sense of belonging." The phrase "drifting resonance" appears twice verbatim. Filter constructions like "she realized" and "she felt" accumulate in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clean but suffers from paraphrase loops: "seeking to rectify what had been lost" restates her musician-to-translator arc unnecessarily. Template cadence appears in "She had tried everything—composing melodies...teaching herself...attempting to recreate" which lists without pressure. The phrase "unshaken marvels" appears twice without evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias had come...," "Elias had no idea...," "Elias opened it...") and abstract descriptors replace concrete detail in crucial moments. The phrase "chased stillness" appears without clear meaning, and the final transformation sequence relies on telling ("water above began to part") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose relies on worn metaphors ("embers of a dying fire," "ghost through the night") and abstract descriptors ("gently persistent," "amplified quiet"). Template cadence appears in parallel structures: "She spoke of... She lifted..." Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly around the concept of unity being restated without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose demonstrates competent control with varied sentence structure and atmospheric description, but suffers from overwriting in figurative density ("viaduct stretched like a skeletal ribcage," "sky bled into hues," "wellspring waiting to be shared"). Template mystical phrasing ("pure of heart," "spark that refused to extinguish") and abstract emotional summaries ("heart fuller") weaken specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose demonstrates competent rhythm and varied sentence structure, avoiding major artifacts. However, abstract phrasing dulls momentum: "a revelation that left her breathless" summarizes rather than embodies the peak experience. The story relies on conceptual descriptors ("otherworldly glow," "ethereal light") over concrete sensory detail, reducing immediacy at crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows well with varied sentence structure and strong imagery. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "massive barrier erected by those who sought to control" could be tighter, and abstract phrases like "gesture of defiance against a dying world" slow momentum. The final paragraph contains unnecessary scaffolding about what the liberator "would" do.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several passages suffer from abstract inflation: "imprint memories...into the very fabric of existence," "gaps in her own recollections," "beauty in collecting absences, there is wholeness." The metaphysical mechanics lack concrete grounding, creating opacity around the central action. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("trembling," "breath caught"). Information density is moderate but hampered by conceptual vagueness rather than concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some evocative imagery. However, multiple instances of telling weaken momentum: "quietly savvy," "movements calculated," "motives hidden," "curiosity piqued." The phrase "luminous disbelief" appears twice as a label rather than embodied description. Some redundancy exists between "illuminated moments" and various light/glow references that don't accumulate meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose achieves clarity but suffers from abstract phrasing and metaphor density that slows momentum: "The thawing heart, her own and others', was a process, not a destination." Several paraphrase loops appear ("craft safe zones for inquiry"/"spaces where questions could be asked without fear"). The dramatic narration device adds texture but the overall information density remains low with multiple sentences restating the same emotional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structure. Some overwriting appears ("the library's timeless embrace," "shadows deepening as if acknowledging her resolve") but doesn't obscure meaning. Information density is adequate though several passages could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density through phrases like "storm-tossed ridge" and "flaking gold leaf," but suffers from repetitive structures ("The oracle's voice...The oracle's eyes...The oracle smiled"). The metaphor "marbled hush" contradicts earlier "ambered hush," and several sentences paraphrase similar content about silence and darkness.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied syntax, though several passages drift toward abstract philosophizing: "echoes of something greater, something it had always been a part of" lacks concrete imagery. The recurring "remarkably composed" and variations on "something more/deeper" create mild redundancy. Information density suffers in the transcendent sequence where vague descriptions ("everywhere and nowhere at once") replace specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "transparency could mend what had frayed"/"honesty felt like a risky bridge" restates the same conflict. "Ambiguously clear" appears three times without earning its repetition. Template phrasing emerges in "As she stared...she noticed," "As the night deepened," "As the night wore on." The prose achieves moments of beauty but lacks consistent propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from abstract phrasing ("testament to his patience," "symbols of resilience") and repetitive "Elias [verb]" constructions. The paraphrase loop between "true beauty lies in the effort, not the result" and later thematic restatements dulls momentum, though the final image of mingling light achieves specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from template phrasing ("loomed like a metallic scar," "breath fogging the air") and repetitive constructions. Multiple instances of telling rather than showing ("defined her," "fueled by years of being dismissed"). The "icy warmth" oxymoron appears twice without earning its paradox through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clear prose with evocative phrases like "the water damage creating images that seemed almost deliberate" and momentum through Clara's discovery sequence. However, abstract repetitions of "in between spaces" (4x) and "wordless conversation" (2x) create mild loops, while some metaphysical descriptions like "time itself seemed to stand still" lean toward generic rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and atmospheric density ("The station seemed to breathe around her, its metal frame expanding and contracting"). However, abstract phrasing accumulates heavily ("swaying certainties," "auroral sorrow," "occupy the margins") without concrete grounding, and the final paragraph contains conceptual loops about transformation and resilience that blur rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and good momentum through action beats. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Minor overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("weight of a swallowed truth" mixed with ghost imagery) and some template phrasing ("She stood, the valve wheel clutched in her hand, and followed the noise"). The final paragraph contains slight redundancy between "weight lift" and "sense of peace."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.6)
    While the prose achieves atmospheric density, several passages contain abstract scaffolding ("fragile balance she sought to preserve," "deeper understanding of the fragile beauty of existence") and conceptual redundancy. The transformation sequence particularly suffers from vague descriptors ("vast emptiness that was both terrifying and liberating") that could be replaced with concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("as if each step were a note in a symphony only she could hear") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstraction. Several passages edge toward purple prose ("the ridge seemed to hum with life, the roots beneath their feet stirring with stories yet to be told"). Information density is moderate, with some sentences doing single duty rather than layered work.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from template phrasing ("her steps measured, her gaze sensitively perceptive") and abstract descriptors ("bronze quiet of forgotten eras"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "displaced axis" concept is restated without advancement. The phrase "sensitively perceptive" appears twice verbatim, suggesting scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.3)
    Extensive paraphrase loops plague the text: "cryptic fortune cookie writer" / "enigmatic fortunes" / "cryptic nature" cycle the same concept. Template cadence appears throughout ("Li Wei's latest batch...Li Wei had stumbled...Li Wei worked...Li Wei set down"). Abstract phrases like "transpose life into a new key" and "conductor of fate" lack concrete grounding. The text reads as extended scaffolding without sharp, propulsive sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose shows competent rhythm and varies sentence structure, but abstract phrasing dominates ("vast and enigmatic space," "cosmic event," "pure assumption"). Several paraphrase loops appear: "silence wasn't empty but resonant" followed by describing silence as "not an absence but as a presence." The writing lacks the concrete specificity and information density needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, especially in the symphony description cascading through parallel structures. Information density is high in memory-mapping sequences. Deductions for repetitive "seemed to" constructions (appears 4 times) and some abstract padding ("ancient energy," "cosmic urgency") that doesn't advance specific pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from extensive paraphrase loops: "The labyrinth of self was not something to conquer but something to embrace" immediately follows the same realization stated differently. Template cadence appears in "She saw versions...others who...still others who." Filter verbs proliferate ("she felt," "she knew," "she saw") without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose shows strong moments like "walls hummed with echoes of rhythms long forgotten" but suffers from abstraction loops—"emotional numbness," "constant companion," "shield against pain" restate without advancing. The transformation sequence relies on telling ("Colors seemed brighter, the air sharper") rather than concrete embodied detail. Template phrasing appears in "She realized then that" and "In that moment."

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional but relies on telling phrases ("credibly curious," "resolve hardening") and generic descriptors ("eerily empty," "lingering unease"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "sanctuary"/"refuge," "burden"/"promise" without added pressure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than crystallizing in image.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between present and memory scenes. Information density good in descriptive passages. Minor loops appear ("thick with sorrow"/"voice thick with sorrow," "crystal shadows" repeated) and some elevated diction in peak moments ("indescribably familiar") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "pattern" that serves the accumulative structure. However, multiple filter constructions ("seemed to" appears 5+ times), some abstract phrasing ("texture of time" remains vague), and the awkward "passionate subtlety" construction detract. The template phrase "Elias [verb], his [noun] [verbing]" appears too frequently.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose shows strong moments of sensory specificity and rhythmic control, particularly in the musical passages. However, abstract phrases like "beauty in the unfinished" and "chronic hush" lack concrete grounding, and some elevated diction ("serene defiance," "pulse with quiet urgency") creates distance without clear purpose. Minor template cadence in "She knelt...She sat...She thought."

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is solid with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some abstract phrasing ("tapestry of feeling"), occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew"), and slight overwriting in metaphorical language during the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.0)
    Template cadence pervades ("Elara realized," "Elara felt," "Elara knew"). Abstract descriptors replace specificity ("meaningful," "important," "enriched"). The phrase "cycles of compassion" repeats without variation. Information density is low with multiple sentences restating the same emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstract summarizing ("boldly sympathetic nature," "quiet warmth") and repetitive structures. The Echo scene particularly lacks concrete detail, defaulting to telling over showing. Some elegant moments ("where the sky bled into the earth") are undermined by scaffolding phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("interrupted cadence," "untainted time," "spaces between moments," "eternal song of time") creating opacity. The phrase "across the span of a giant's nap" requires multiple reads to parse. Some redundancy appears: "clutched tightly" could be "clutched," and the pendant's warmth is mentioned three times in similar ways.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive structures ("She recalled...Now, she wondered," "she felt...she sensed") and some overwriting ("vast underground cavern," "secretive conjurer"). Several paraphrase loops appear: "patterns aligned perfectly, revealing a hidden sequence" followed immediately by redundant deciphering description. Information density could be higher—many sentences do single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from abstract telling ("their heart filled with purpose") and repetitive structures ("They thought of... They knew..."). Several paraphrase loops appear: "to become visible to those who needed them" restates across multiple paragraphs. Information density is moderate—many sentences do single duty. The "sense memory" description provides specificity but the phrase "weight of a story half-forgotten" remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from abstract declaration and concept-loops: "fear, longing, possibility of change" restates without advancing; "resistance to acceptance, from control to surrender" duplicates. Template phrasing appears ("She had always been," "She knew what she had to do"). The phrase "circuitously sincere" repeats without clarifying meaning. Filter verbs and abstract emotional labels dominate over embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery ("droplets formed trails that seemed to lead somewhere"). Some overwriting appears ("tapestry of parched lands and reclaimed seas," "ancient sentinels") but doesn't obscure meaning. The ending paragraph maintains momentum while landing the transformation, though "haggard awe" feels forced as a callback.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstract language ("gnawing doubt," "surge of purpose," "testament to the steadily unpredictable nature of existence") creates distance. Template phrases like "As Elara ventured deeper" and "Without hesitation, she reached out" signal algorithmic construction. The transformation sequence relies on telling rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though some phrases strain for effect ("navigated absences," "reactively visionary"). Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition in "fragment/fragments" appears four times, and some elevated diction ("petrichor," "testament") occasionally drifts from the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from template constructions ("After what felt like hours," "as though it had been waiting"). Several metaphors strain ("mist curling around her ankles like a living thing"). The paraphrase loop of "trembling certainty" appearing twice identically triggers deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structure, though abstract phrases like "entangled memories" and "sculpt space for reflection" feel grafted rather than organic. The "unheard symphony" metaphor recurs without clear sensory grounding. Several passages tell what could be shown, particularly the villagers' reception of her discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.3)
    Several passages contain redundant phrasing: "endless, aching void" followed immediately by "monotonous cycle" restates emptiness without added pressure. "Curiosity, a feeling long dormant, stirred within him" tells what the previous paragraph already showed. The prose reaches for elevated diction ("prismatic escondite," "kaleidoscope of dimensions") that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the action.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structures and selective detail. Several abstraction loops weaken momentum: "It was unsettling but not unwelcome" followed by the simile restates rather than advances; "the mathematics of a fair trade" appears three times without evolution. The ending accumulates abstract nouns ("balance, honesty, and the courage") that dilute the concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("blooming labyrinth," "gilded-leaf stationer") and some template phrasing ("Her hands moved with precision, each gesture a testament"). Several passages tell what could be shown: "This was not just an invented history; it was a memory." Information density is moderate but could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, avoiding template cadence. However, abstract phrasing dominates ("whispered secrets," "filtered reality differently," "symphony of lives intertwined") without sufficient concrete grounding. The paraphrase loop "They were not just a survivor...they were a guardian" restates rather than advances. Information density remains moderate with some lines doing single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose achieves moments of strong sensory writing, particularly in the cello sequence, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("the whisper of closing pages brushing against her skin") and abstract phrasing. Several metaphors strain clarity ("standing at the edge of time itself"), and the final paragraph contains redundant thematic statements that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from abstraction loops and template phrasing: "whispered in promises," "pull of something hidden, something vital," "beacon of possibility." High-pressure beats summarize rather than dramatize—the entire festival climax compresses into telling ("grand display," "rallying cry") without scene-level specificity or embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong sensory detail and varied sentence structure. Information density is good - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for redundancy ("documenting every detail...meticulously documented"), some filter verb clustering ("caught her eye," "formed in her throat"), and the somewhat purple "universe whispered secrets."

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("She + verb" dominates) and unnecessary abstraction ("negotiation between her and the machine, a silent dialogue"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "her blind eyes, clouded yet keen" followed by redundant explanation of her non-visual methods. The "anchor" metaphor in the final paragraph strains when applied to Elara's shop as both sanctuary and force.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between reflection and discovery. However, several template phrases appear ("stretched before her," "heart quickened," "tears welled") and the figurative density occasionally overreaches ("cutting through the stillness like a silent herald") without consistent payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("his steps were measured, his movements deliberate") and abstract descriptors that don't advance pressure. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the rhythm concept. The writing lacks the information density and propulsion needed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence pervades ("Maya reached," "Maya realized," "Maya discovered," "Maya felt"), creating mechanical rhythm. Abstract phrases like "lonesome splendor," "gathered hush," and "harness the ephemeral" repeat without gaining specificity or embodied meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose shows strong moments ("The air grew colder, heavier, as if the lighthouse itself resisted his descent") but suffers from repetitive abstract declarations. Template phrasing appears in emotional summaries: "he wanted to be heard, to tell his story without fear of disbelief." The final paragraph contains multiple telling statements that should be dramatized: "in that truth, he found his freedom."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "bound by a debt"/"debt she owed"/"to repay what was owed" cycle the same concept. Template phrases like "for the first time in lifetimes" and "far from over" read as scaffolding. The "lovingly venomous" and "mournful elation" oxymora feel forced rather than earned through the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.2)
    Pervasive abstraction and template phrasing weaken line-level craft: "her mission was clear," "a task she had dedicated her life to," "her story became one with the canyon." Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("mend what had been fractured"/"mending"/"mended"). The phrase "hauntingly optimistic" repeats three times without variation. Filter-heavy construction ("seemed to," "allowed her to see") dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose clarity suffers from overwriting: "tree roots snaked between ancient bones like veins through forgotten history" stacks metaphors unnecessarily. Template phrases appear throughout ("trembling hands," "heart quickened"). The paraphrase loop "It was more than an object; it was a bridge between the past and the present" restates without advancing. Information density remains low with passages that could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting and abstraction: "futuristic nostalgia," "ethereal glow," "cryptic communication." Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "codes in children's sidewalk chalk were her latest discovery, a method so unconventional it had eluded everyone else" restates information. The writing reaches for literary effect through elevated diction rather than precise, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts (shorter during tension, longer for description). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("the fabric of reality thinned," "nexus of adjacent possibilities") but stays within genre conventions. Information density is adequate—most sentences advance plot or atmosphere—though occasional redundancy appears ("The conspiracy was vast, but so were the stories of the stars").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from overwriting in figurative density—nearly every sentence in atmospheric passages contains metaphor or simile. Template phrasing appears in "Elara knew," "Elara realized," "Elara felt" constructions. The paragraph beginning "The unsent letters were fragments" explains concept that should emerge through action, creating momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("condensation that clung to the surface like tears") with varied rhythm. However, abstract scaffolding appears throughout: "fragile peace," "jagged edges," "weight of what she was about to do." The phrase "lotus-hearted ache" appears twice, creating unnecessary loop. Some sentences rely on telling rather than showing emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flows well with varied sentence structures and effective atmospheric description. However, several abstract phrases weaken impact: "something elusive," "strange warmth emanate," "renewed sense of purpose." The ending paragraph contains unnecessary summary ("would remain lost...would live on") that dilutes the final image's power.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose achieves basic clarity but suffers from repetitive constructions ("As she worked," "As she restored," "As she hummed") and abstract emotional labels. The phrase "methodically playful" forces an oxymoron without earning the paradox through action. Several passages contain conceptual redundancy, particularly the final paragraph's circular restatement of the certainty/curiosity exchange without adding new insight.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts during tension. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. However, several generic intensifiers weaken precision ("chaos converging," "encroaching darkness"), and the final paragraph accumulates abstract declarations that could be more grounded in image.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from abstract declaration loops ("centuries of longing" appears twice verbatim) and reliance on telling over concrete action. Multiple passages restate the same concept without advancement: "transform pain into beauty" cycles through various phrasings. The template progression "Hours turned into days, and days into weeks" followed by "As the weeks turned into months" creates mechanical time passage without specific incident.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: "crystalline tears," "haunting melody," "luminous floor" pile up without earning their elevation. Template phrases proliferate: "her heart quickened," "trembling hands," "hold its breath." The paraphrase loop "preserve the sound of forgotten names" appears four times nearly verbatim.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates competent rhythm and variety, though several phrases approach purple territory: "symphonies of truth, melodies woven from the purest intentions." Some redundancy appears ("fractured her bond"/"mend what she had fractured"). The writing is clean but occasionally overwrought, particularly in describing the magical elements without grounding them in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose generally maintains clarity and momentum, with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Strong moments include the tactile description of the chain and the breathing amphitheater. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "testament to a time when gods and mortals might have shared the same stage" and redundant emotional labeling ("doubt and hope," "fear and curiosity") that could be trimmed for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose generally maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "blooming and withering" (appears 3 times), some abstract constructions ("paper trail of half-truths"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("symphony of blooming and withering").

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery. Information density is generally good, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("desperate to piece together" follows established searching). The "fractured hush" and light/shadow imagery effectively support atmosphere, but occasional abstract phrasing ("navigating a maze invisible to others") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from overwriting density—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphors ("stars trapped in a jar" alongside "shadowseam wonder") and elevated diction occasionally obscure rather than illuminate.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "missing pieces of her latest recollection—fragments of a memory she could almost grasp but not quite hold" restates the same idea. Template cadence appears in "She closed her eyes... She picked one up... She realized... She gasped..." Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "seemed to") dull immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure, though several abstract phrases loop without advancement ("maestro of the unexpected," "philosopher of chance"). The "calculated wilderness" oxymoron and repeated abstractions about serendipity create density without concrete progression. Template phrases like "ready to happen again" and "a little less ordinary, a little more alive" feel formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some elevated diction borders on purple ("shadows stretched like whispers across dewy petals") but remains controlled. The repeated "obsidian grace" and occasional abstraction ("cosmic verse on mortal skin") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive stems ("He saw... He saw..."), abstract assertions ("moments of clarity that shone like stars"), and philosophy-speak that replaces scene work ("the mundane and the magical intersected"). Multiple paraphrase loops restate the pattern-finding concept without advancement. The template cadence and conceptual redundancy prevent momentum, particularly in the atrium sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from significant overwriting with mixed metaphors ("smoke" that "clings," boxes that "breathe," cracks that "glow"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("He thought of...He thought of..."). Abstract philosophizing ("bargained innocence resonated within him") and therapy-speak ("enlighten himself...with acceptance") dull immediacy. The piece needs aggressive cutting of scaffolding and ornamental language.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "Hope, she realized, was not something to be calculated, but something to be felt, to be lived" restates what the previous sentence already conveyed through "harmony of the design itself." Abstract phrasing like "serene upheaval" and "trial balloon of her own making" relies on prompt language rather than earned imagery. The prose achieves moments of clarity but suffers from conceptual redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor issues with occasional overwriting ("twisted like a serpent," "breathing with whispers") and some abstraction that could be more concrete ("the legacy's burden, a weight passed down"). No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with figurative language in most sentences ("air hummed with promise," "spectrum of colors," "shimmered like a dream") without pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("A child who...saw; a man who...saw; a woman who...saw"). Information density is moderate but momentum stalls during abstract passages.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, abstract phrasing ("weight of her mission," "beacon of hope," "ritual significance") creates distance, and some passages rely on telling over showing ("The negotiation was grueling"). The filter verb "felt" appears multiple times, dulling immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("silence of once-thrilling bird songs") but suffers from abstraction loops ("symbol of what humanity had destroyed, and what she hoped to reclaim" restates rather than advances). Several template constructions ("She had acquired it," "She followed them") create mechanical rhythm. The phrase "fractured grace" appears twice, creating unnecessary echo.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "bodily poetic grace" feels forced, and there's template repetition in "She knew...she also knew she had done." The phrase "harvest of echoes" gets recycled without evolution. Information density is moderate - some sentences merely restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant overwriting pervades: "silent sentinel," "flickering flames," "quiet yet powerful force." Template phrasing appears throughout ("As he sat," "As he began," "By the time"). The metaphor density in reflective passages ("conduit for half-lit epiphanies, moments of clarity that shimmered like embers") slows momentum without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose flows with varied sentence structure and creates atmospheric density, but suffers from overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language or elevated diction ("fragment of a forgotten dream," "haunting whisper"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the grotto's mystical qualities and Elara's connection to the unseen.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty: "the aurora above pulsed with colors that danced in time with her movements." However, abstract phrases like "bridges to the future" and "spark of hope" lean toward conceptual summary. Some filter constructions ("she felt," "seemed to") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstraction dulls momentum: "intricate balance between order and chaos," "deeper truth that lay just beyond the veil," "vast, uncharted territory." Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same mystical concepts without advancement. The prose favors vague intensifiers over concrete imagery, creating distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose suffers from abstract inflation and repetitive phrasing—"encrypted devotion" appears four times, "covenant" five times, "dusky harmony" three times. Sentences favor abstract concepts over concrete action: "His motivation to seal a covenant with the unknown stemmed from a deep-seated belief..." Template cadence appears in parallel constructions. The writing prioritizes elevated diction over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive telling over showing: "Elara smiled softly, her scheming mind already at work" and "his resentment palpable" exemplify the pattern. Template dialogue tags proliferate ("she replied," "he muttered," "he asked"). The prose relies on abstract emotional labels ("genuine compassion," "raw" voice) rather than concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong rhythm, particularly in "The fog swirled around her, but she felt no fear." However, several instances of overwriting appear: "ethereal beauty of her creations," "otherworldly energy," and the extended metaphor of "glass mountains." The phrase "synchronized rhythm of her breath and the whispered dreams" pushes into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose achieves moments of clarity ("branches swaying in encouragement") but suffers from paraphrase loops ("mending wasn't about restoring what was lost but about creating something new from the pieces" restates the deciduous metaphor). Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("for the first time in months, she felt hope") and abstract summaries dominate over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with abstract philosophizing: "inheritance wasn't just about what was passed down; it was about what was discovered, what was unearthed between the first and last page of existence." Multiple instances of telling over showing ("Her thoughts were interrupted," "Elara felt a surge of purpose") diminish immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structure and appropriate pacing shifts between exploration and discovery. Some passages achieve strong imagery ("air hummed with whispers of forgotten tomes"). Deductions for redundant phrasing ("twisting corridors"/"twisting and turning"), abstract descriptors ("weight of discovery," "weight of unlearned wisdom"), and the vague final "symphony of secrets."

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("suspended in the air, was a door—not made of wood or metal, but of swirling mist") but suffers from abstract telling in peak beats ("embrace the unkindled solace within herself"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("memories altered"/"memories shifting"), and figurative density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. Information density is moderate; several passages could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive overwriting weakens momentum: "legendary as the tower itself," "symphony," "labyrinth," "tapestry," "sanctuary," "beacon"—figurative language appears in most sentences without earning its elevation. Template phrasing proliferates: "Her task was," "Her method was clear," "Her heart quickened," "Her hands moved." The final paragraph's abstract moralizing ("proving that even the most complex truths...") abandons scene work entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose flows smoothly but suffers from overwriting - "shimmered with a gently luminous glow," "walls humming faintly as if singing." Template fantasy phrases appear throughout: "her heart steady despite the weight of her task." The writing is serviceable but lacks the precision and economy that would create true momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple template phrases weaken momentum: "moved with quiet purpose," "heart raced," "watched in awe." The prose suffers from telling over showing ("She felt a sense of peace") and filter-verb clusters ("she noticed," "she felt," "she realized"). Information density is moderate but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in peak moments ("crystalline stones that shimmered like liquid moonlight") and repetitive abstract phrasing about memory and identity. The story contains multiple paraphrase loops, particularly around Elara's role as preserver. Template cadence appears in "She was...she was" constructions, though rhythm varies adequately elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract descriptors. Template phrases like "her heart ached, but her resolve deepened" and "voices trembling but growing stronger" rely on emotional telling. The recurring light/shadow imagery becomes mechanical rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of abstract telling ("Her motivation was singular," "She foresaw a future") and some overwriting in metaphorical density. The repeated "foresaw" construction creates mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythmic variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Some elegant phrases like "a symphony of nothingness that filled her lungs." However, there's occasional overwriting ("her tone stretching contracted") and some redundancy in describing the bunker's oppressiveness. The "she would never be the same" ending feels slightly clichéd.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with purposeful rhythm matching the serene journey, though several abstract passages lack concrete grounding ("curate those moments," "emotional currents"). Template phrasing appears in transitions ("As they approached," "As they resumed"). The "fluidly logical" descriptor feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows competently but suffers from template fantasy phrasing ("ancient scrolls," "otherworldly light") and repetitive sentence structures in action sequences. The filter-heavy construction ("She saw," "Lira understood," "she felt") dulls immediacy, particularly in moments requiring peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing ("encroaching darkness," "suffocating presence," "chorus of resilience") and template fantasy language weaken line-level impact. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the darkness threatening/pressing/encroaching without variation in specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Elara realized," "Elara returned," "She knew") and abstract phrasing ("tangible force," "pure thought") that dulls immediacy. The text relies heavily on telling over showing, particularly in the transformation sequence where "pressure began to condense" summarizes what should be the story's pivotal dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose maintains readability with varied sentence structure and some evocative phrases ("first yawn of evening"). However, abstract descriptors proliferate ("forgotten dreams," "bridge of intuition"), and the final paragraph loops through synonymous descriptions of Eleanor's role without advancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting pervades peak moments ("storm of light," "fabric of the greenhouse," "weaver of possibility") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in "He stepped...He reached...He closed his eyes" sequence, and abstract phrases like "possibility itself had taken root" replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from abstract emotional labeling ("broken-hearted," "tactfully hopeful," "heart lighter") and repetitive constructions ("She had," "She decided," "She began"). The metaphor "dust on the shelves seemed to shimmer, as if approving" strains credibility, and several passages paraphrase rather than advance ("It was a way to mend her own brokenness, to find meaning").

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose shows competent clarity with varied sentence lengths and some evocative phrases like "heavens had spilled their secrets." However, multiple clichéd constructions appear: "weight...pressing on her shoulders," "beacon" of rebellion, "ghost in their machine." The phrase "tyranny of indifference that had suffixed humanity's spirit" contains an awkward verb choice that disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several passages contain redundant phrasing: "muffling the world in its damp embrace" followed by mist "swirling in patterns" and "heavy and oppressive" repeats the same atmospheric note. Template cadence appears in "He played... He knew... He felt... He played on..." The prose achieves atmosphere but lacks precision—"otherworldly," "ethereal," and "sacred" blur together as vague elevations.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows adequately but contains repetitive structures ("She learned that... She spent days... She was not just...") and abstract declarations ("something had shifted forever"). Template phrases like "magnitude of her discovery" and "fabric of her world" lack specificity. The ending paragraph summarizes transformation through telling rather than charged image: "Elara stood transformed, ready to carry the message."

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("The tinkerer..." appears 11 times) and occasional purple patches ("swirling leaves danced in the drafts"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "embracing uncertainty, not fearing it" followed immediately by "befriended uncertainty" restates without advancing. The metaphorical language sometimes strains ("inexplicable pull toward the object, a sense of uncertainly certain purpose").

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the transformation sequence. Some abstract phrasing weakens momentum ("factually mystical blend," "luminous regret"), and the visions paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes. Generally clean execution with good paragraph variation, though information density could be higher in expository passages.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Some redundancy appears ("weight of her mission"/"weight of all the souls") and filter phrases like "she felt the ache" and "feeling its warmth" reduce immediacy in moments that need directness.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=5.1)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "reminder of her resilience"/"symbol of her determination" and repeated forest descriptions. The phrase "ultraviolet" appears seven times without evolving meaning, and abstract concepts dominate over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of elevated diction ("testament to the resilience of intuition") and abstract phrasing ("eternal instant") reduce immediacy. The phrase "elusively tangible" appears twice, suggesting template language.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and decent momentum. However, multiple template phrases weaken impact: "chill ran down his spine," "heart pounding," "warmth spread through him." The paraphrase loop around Marcus's gift (paragraph 1 and 4) and some filter-heavy passages ("he felt a pull," "he noticed") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm. Information density works well in key passages ("The clouds spoke to her, their voices a chorus of rustling awakenings"). However, several phrases border on purple prose ("swirling sea of clouds," "painted the clouds in hues of pink and gold") and some transitions rely on convenient summarization rather than dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery, though some passages tend toward overwriting ("torrents of luminescence that danced across the spires, leaving behind fleeting visions"). Minor redundancies appear ("defunct revolutionary" concept repeated) but don't significantly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several passages show strong imagery ("clock struck midnight," "chip from the philosopher's stone...holding a stolen fragment of dawn"). However, template cadence appears in journey description ("took him through...Along the way, he met"), and abstract phrases like "tinkersong wonder" and "sense of potential waiting to be unleashed" lack concrete grounding. The prose tends toward ornamental metaphor over propulsive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is generally strong. However, some overwriting appears in metaphorical language ("silent sentinels," "hinge between worlds") and the final paragraph contains abstract philosophizing ("touched something infinite") that dulls the closure's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract inflation ("timewoven alliances," "scaffold complexity with simplicity," "turbine-hum reverie") that obscures rather than clarifies. Template progression ("She stepped forward... She approached cautiously... She placed her slide") and conceptual loops ("reimagine" repeated without advancing meaning) drain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose shows competent variation and some lovely phrases ("fragments of history that whispered stories") but suffers from abstract inflation ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") and repetitive constructions around the central metaphor. The text loops the flowers-at-night question without advancing its meaning until the final declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flows with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Some overwriting appears ("shadow stretching like a dark whisper," "burned like a torch") without pattern-teaching. The phrase "retrocognitively trapped" feels forced, and abstract declarations like "truth would finally be set free" lack concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose is functional but relies on telling over showing ("Her motivation was clear," "The cove was dead"). Template phrasing appears throughout ("stood at the edge," "heart pounding," "smiled, knowing"). The transformation sequence uses vague abstractions ("something greater," "vision solidify") rather than concrete imagery. Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and paragraph lengths creating appropriate rhythm. Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing discovery or atmosphere. However, some passages contain mild redundancy ("a message, a prophecy") and occasional overwriting ("gnarled trees heavy with fruit that seemed to hum"). The filter verb "seemed" appears multiple times, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose clarity suffers from abstract conceptual language ("decreasing entropy," "texture of borrowed time") that never gains concrete meaning. Several passages contain near-paraphrase loops ("restore the world"/"heal the world"), and the piece relies on telling over showing, particularly in emotional transitions and thematic revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias felt," "He wondered," "He reached") and abstract phrasing in crucial beats ("revelation," "heartbeat of the world"). The final paragraph contains multiple template phrases that dilute impact: "testament to the power of listening" reads as summary rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract elevation ("eternal canvas," "paradoxical truth") and template phrasing ("She began to see," "She realized"). The line "flourishing stillness crystallized in her thoughts" exemplifies the tendency toward abstract summary over concrete embodiment. Information density is moderate; some passages do multiple jobs but others merely describe.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=5.1)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with phrases like "symphony of solitude" and "shade of time" that prioritize poeticism over clarity. Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("whispers of forgotten dreams"/"whispers of the wind that carried secrets"), and the prose relies on abstract descriptors rather than concrete action, particularly in the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.5)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstract phrasing ("testament to its endurance," "profound sense of purpose") and repetitive constructions. Some effective imagery exists ("metallic surface was cracked, revealing fragments of memories") but density remains low with single-function sentences. The final paragraph loops conceptually, restating belonging and connection without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstract phrasing ("harmonized discord," "coherent verses") and repetitive structures. Multiple filter constructions ("she noticed," "she examined," "she asked") dull immediacy. The phrase "warmly attentive" appears twice verbatim, suggesting template language rather than organic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "determined to foster interspecies respect"/"to foster respect between humans and the natural world"/"interspecies respect he sought to foster." Template phrasing like "Days turned into weeks" and abstract declarations ("The orchard was alive, not just in its leaves and roots, but in its spirit") replace specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstract philosophical language ("existential," "nexus," "phenomenon") that creates distance. Several passages read as summary rather than scene: "Her motivation was singular" tells rather than shows. The density of figurative language ("mosaic of artificial pilgrimage") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing weakens line-level precision: "narrow vastness," "weight of centuries," "twilight's embrace." Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly in paragraphs 5-7 which restate the transformation theme without adding pressure. The phrase "narrow vastness" appears three times without evolving meaning. Template cadence emerges in "The coachman's [noun]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose generally clear with good momentum, though some sentences carry abstract scaffolding ("testament to his desire for solitude"). Information density varies—strong in sensory passages, thinner in transitional moments. The phonograph sequence effectively varies rhythm to match discovery. Deduction for filter-heavy construction in places ("Elias realized," "he understood") and occasional overwriting ("amber and ash").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "blessed pariah" appears 4 times, "true north" 6 times, "echoed silence" 3 times, creating a loop effect. Abstract phrases like "fragility of existence," "inevitability of change," and "force that transcended" replace concrete imagery. The prose relies heavily on telling ("It was a vision both beautiful and terrifying") rather than embodied showing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Several template phrases appear ("mix of cautious abandon and unyielding determination," "sharp as ever," "cold and relentless") that feel like writing-prompt artifacts. The phrase "apprentice of wonder" appears twice without variation. Information density could be higher—some passages describe without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose tends toward abstract elevation ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence") that occasionally obscures concrete action. Some template phrasing: "She felt a kinship with it," "Elara felt a strange sense of liberation." The walking sequence could use more physical specificity about how steps create words.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=5.9)
    The writing flows adequately with varied sentence structure, though it suffers from abstract descriptors and conceptual redundancy - multiple variations on fragmentation/wholeness without advancing pressure. Lines like "The pain of remembering had grown too sharp, too raw" and "heavy with the promise of hidden thunder" rely on telling emotional states rather than showing them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "weight of unspoken histories," "shadows that clung to ancient stone walls," and the repetitive use of "frayed" dilutes impact. The filter verb "seemed" appears frequently enough to dull immediacy. Information density is moderate but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("light coalesced into shapes—shadows of people she had wronged") but suffers from density issues. Figurative language appears in most high-pressure sentences without always advancing the story. Some redundancy exists ("swirled faster now" after already establishing swirling), and the elevated register occasionally obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "memories quilts together"/"quilts memories together," "edge of oblivion" repeated verbatim, "between breaths held underwater" used twice identically. Template cadence appears in "She saw... she saw... she saw" sequence. The prose achieves moments of strong imagery but these repetitive patterns and some abstract phrasing ("dire enchantment," "untethered") create drag.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting appears throughout, particularly "where the waves whispered secrets to the stone" and similar poeticisms that don't earn their figurative weight. Template cadence emerges in the final section with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. The phrase "temporary eternity" appears four times, creating conceptual redundancy. Information density is moderate but several paragraphs could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum, but several instances of abstract telling ("a stirring of hope, a sense that change was coming") and some redundancy in describing the vial's properties. The phrase "screaming tenderness" stands out as fresh, though some passages rely on generic descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=5.3)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "sanctuary and her prison" / "isolation...solitary"; "grueling...raw from hours of labor." Template cadence appears in "She had found...She believed...She began to suspect." The "patchwork" metaphor gets overworked without earning its centrality. Information density is moderate but could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("fractured grace," "swirling colors") but suffers from telling over showing in emotional beats ("felt a chill," "strange sensation," "strange calm"). Template emotional transitions and filter-heavy construction ("Elias felt," "He knew," "Elias hesitated") dull immediacy. The Latin incantation and the convenient one-book solution feel like scaffolding that could be cut or compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and atmospheric density, though occasional redundancies appear ("mist seemed thicker, the silence heavier"). The phrase "softly persistent" effectively recurs without feeling forced, and sentence variety maintains momentum through the investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structure and evocative imagery. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("cobblestone streets whispered tales," "silver leaves," "shadows that shift") and occasional template phrasing ("As he leaned closer," "As he approached," "As midsummer gave way").

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures and abstract descriptors. "Softly commanding" appears three times without purpose; "lacy menace" twice without clarity. Clichéd phrases proliferate: "weight settled upon her," "heart sank," "tremor in her chest." The filter-verb stack in paragraph 3 ("seemed to pulse," "seemed to sigh") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe overwriting pervades the piece with mixed metaphors (shell as "key," "palette," "fragment of star"), elevated diction incongruent with scene pressure, and template mystical phrasing. Paraphrase loops appear throughout (multiple restatements of capturing/transforming moments). The prose prioritizes ornamental description over narrative momentum, with nearly every sentence attempting figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("memories of her subconscious into coherent tales," "like wild horses refusing to be tamed") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Several metaphors pile up without clear connection (wild horses, shattered mirror, leaves in storm). The phrase "fingers brushing against eternity" in the final line strains for profundity. Some filter verb clusters ("felt herself lift," "saw herself") dull immediacy during the dreamscape sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "a bridge between generations" immediately followed by similar conceptual territory, and "quiet strength" ideas repeated across paragraphs. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions. The prose achieves moments of specificity ("threads worn smooth by countless uses") but relies heavily on abstract descriptors ("emotional terrain," "untold memories") that reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during stress moments. However, several overwrought phrases ("saturated hush of twilight," "elastic, stretching and contracting") and mild redundancy ("renewed determination"/"with renewed determination") create occasional drag without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with mixed metaphors ("threads fraying," "currents," "cracks in glass") that muddle rather than clarify. Template phrases like "her heart lighter than it had been in years" and "a warmth that wrapped around her like a shawl" lack specificity. The description-heavy passages slow momentum, particularly in the middle third where abstract reflection dominates action.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose flows competently with varied sentence structure, though it leans heavily on abstract descriptors ("weight of centuries," "fabric of time"). Some effective imagery ("dictionary's pages seemed to rearrange themselves") but pervasive abstraction dulls momentum. Template phrases like "testament to the power of" and "keeper of the" suggest formulaic construction.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstraction ("essence of time itself," "endless possibility") and repetitive constructions ("Elias's heart pounded," "Elias realized," "Elias felt"). The philosophical passages rely on telling rather than concrete imagery, particularly in the resolution where concepts replace sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose shows moments of vivid imagery ("bioluminescent mushroom farm...pulsed softly, casting an ethereal light") but suffers from abstract emotional labeling ("strange sense of peace") and filter-heavy construction ("she felt," "she saw," "she noticed"). The final paragraph contains multiple abstraction loops about revolution and understanding without concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.4)
    Competent prose with moments of beauty ("light flickering like a heartbeat") but suffers from abstraction and telling. Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("seeking answers to questions he could no longer articulate" followed by similar restatements). Filter-heavy construction ("she realized," "she wondered," "she thought") dulls immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of the melody/humming motif. Some overwriting appears ("crystalline note rang out," "tapestry of existence") and filter verb clusters in middle section ("he realized," "he began to understand"). The paraphrase loop about searching for endings/people weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.6)
    The prose flows smoothly but suffers from overwriting in places - "blooming" appears four times, creating unintentional repetition. Abstract phrases like "the weight of small moments" and "haunted euphoria" recur without gaining specificity. The writing tends toward telling over showing, particularly in passages about Elara's purpose and realizations, though no major clarity issues impede comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose generally flows well but suffers from occasional overwriting ("gnaws at the soul when the world feels too vast and too indifferent"). Some passages feel scaffolded, particularly the explicit theme statements. The transformation sequence maintains clarity but could achieve more with less. Several metaphors strain (breathing station, ivy as nature reclaiming).

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=6.8)
    Opening and closing lines effectively bookend the piece with the ultrasonic forest frame. Several phrases show strong compression ("constellation paused in their eternal shifting"). However, repetitive structures appear ("Elara smiled...Elara's story became legend") and the final third contains summary loops that reduce momentum, particularly "a tale of a blind mapmaker who found her way not by sight, but by sound, by touch, by the languages absorbed through her skin."

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and clear momentum, though several passages contain density issues: "fragments of time—moments from the past, present, and future colliding" could be more concrete. Some figurative language feels forced ("time seemed to fold in on itself like a crumpled sheet of paper"), and there's mild template cadence in the "She saw..." repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.3)
    Significant paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "mapping the silence" appears three times with minimal variation; "her hands moved/danced/began to move" creates repetitive gesture descriptions. Abstract declarations ("quiet magic," "commanding and invisible") replace concrete imagery. The prose achieves moments of clarity but suffers from template cadence and conceptual redundancy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and clear progression, though it suffers from repetitive constructions ("The arsonist's..." appears frequently) and some purple patches ("ethereal glow"). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance the plot but rarely do double work.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variety and selective imagery, though some passages lean purple ("otherworldly hue," "liquid memory"). The recurring musical/sonic metaphors cohere well. Minor redundancy appears in the memory descriptions (labyrinth/entangled/threads), and some abstract phrasing ("breathing life into a shared dream") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and strong sensory grounding. However, abstract phrasing weakens impact: "weight of the moment pressing down," "air thick with anticipation," "inexplicable pull." The final paragraph's explanatory mode ("Eli realized... Eli knew") dissipates momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several prose artifacts weaken momentum: redundant phrases like "silent figure"/"silence"/"silent language"/"silent empathy" create repetitive texture, while abstract constructions ("Their stillness was their strength") and template transitions ("As the last words faded") dull immediacy. The metaphor mixing of weaving with shutters (typically opened/closed, not woven) creates conceptual friction, and phrases like "spiralingly calm" feel forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe overwriting throughout: "the hush where past meets prophecy" appears twice, multiple abstract metaphors pile up without advancing action. Template cadence pervades ("As he...," "He would...," "And as he..."). Paraphrase loops abound—the mission to inspire contemplation is restated in various forms without progression. Filter-verb stacks in peak moments dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with evocative maritime imagery and varied sentence structures. Some overwriting appears in mystical passages ("ancient and unknowable," "pulsed with life") that could be more precise. The phrase "combative tenderness" feels forced as thematic summary. Several filter constructions ("she felt," "she realized") diminish immediacy during key revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful repetition of "whittled" and "dried flowers" that builds texture, though phrases like "emotional void" and "morally ambiguous figure" lean abstract. The final paragraph's "quiet resolve hardened" and thematic summary dulls momentum slightly. Filter verbs ("seemed to echo," "seemed to pulse") weaken key images.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors ("cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush") and elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies. Template phrases like "felt a tremor of certainty ripple through them" and "the kind that clings to the skin like a second shadow" weaken precision. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and some strong images like "concertina reed tongue lay forgotten on a stone bench, its metallic body tarnished but still humming faintly." However, abstract phrasing like "barter awakenings with the world" and "energy of the courtyard" dulls specificity, and some metaphors strain (plants "whispering secrets of color and light").

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of "lost sounds" as a motif, avoiding mechanical patterns. However, abstract phrases proliferate: "texture of connection," "auditory history," "labyrinth of lost sounds," "energy of renewal." The final paragraph contains multiple conceptual abstractions that dilute momentum: "rediscovering connection," "embracing it," reducing information density at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose generally flows well with varied sentence structures and clear momentum, but several instances of overwriting appear ("the air hummed with the weight of centuries," "ethereal glow"). The whispered theme statement "To teach withering to bloom again" creates a paraphrase loop with the established motivation, and some filter constructions ("she realized," "she felt") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied rhythm: "Her hands moved steadily, shuffling a deck of cards that shimmered with dark, liquid patterns." Some figurative density in peak moments ("labyrinth of numbers and timestamps") but avoids overwriting. Minor template phrasing in transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.3)
    Dense figurative language ("atoms of nostalgia were alive within its metallic lattice") occasionally obscures clarity without pattern-teaching payoff. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the pagoda's mystery ("remained an enigma, its purpose elusive, its power tantalizingly out of reach"). The prose prioritizes atmospheric description over narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from abstract elevation ("profound sorrow," "collective hopes and fears") and template phrasing ("surge of luminous regret," "filled with a mix of"). The transformation mechanism ("pressed the stone against the vial, and as she did, the shadow began to change") lacks concrete physical detail. Some effective rhythm in quieter passages but overreliance on abstract descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.6)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "sanctuary of reflection"/"place of reflection," "shattered"/"shaken to her core," and the triple repetition of reconstruction concepts. Template cadence appears in "She thought of...She recalled...She knew that..." structures, and abstract philosophical scaffolding ("layers of naivety, layers of fear, layers of doubt") replaces concrete action throughout the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose clarity suffers from overwriting in places: "stone walls whispering secrets only the morning light could decipher" strains the metaphor. Template cadence appears in "She saw herself... She saw a younger version" creating repetitive structure. The phrase "displaced miracle" repeats without evolving meaning. Information density is moderate—several passages restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose achieves clarity and varies rhythm effectively, particularly in descriptive passages. However, abstract phrasing dilutes key moments ("weight of each letter," "sorrow and hope intertwined"), and some passages contain mild redundancy (the extended list of letter types could be compressed for greater impact).

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting pervades with mixed metaphors and elevated diction that obscures rather than clarifies ("shadowed rapture," "symphony of light and sound"). Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same cosmic perception concept without advancement. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over momentum, creating static description rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("glowing sands swirling around her in a vortex of light") but suffers from abstract tell-phrases: "felt its weight as a reminder," "felt important," "strange pull." Several paraphrase loops appear: "divergent archive, a place where memories and dreams converged" followed immediately by restatement about "sparks of the unlit corners."

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose tends toward the ornate with phrases like "symphony of ideas" and "mosaic of experiences and truths" that pile abstractions. Several paraphrase loops appear ("searching for patterns, for meaning. But the more he sought, the more elusive insight became"). The final paragraph contains multiple template constructions beginning with "He."

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose rhythm varies effectively, though metaphorical density occasionally obscures concrete action ("the star imprint itself on her being"). Some elevated diction ("serpentine path," "gauzy light") fits the mythic tone but risks register drift in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("the air was heavy with the kind of quiet that seemed to absorb sound itself") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Filter constructions ("he saw it all") and summary passages in the revelation sequence reduce immediacy where scene work would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=4.7)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Elara's heart quickened," "stones seemed to hum," "weight of centuries" appears twice) and relies on abstract intensifiers. Template cadence appears in the escalation sequence ("She left one in... another in... and finally, in..."). The writing favors tell-mode summaries over scene work, particularly in the crucial middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and controlled with varied sentence structure and appropriate scientific register. Some redundancy appears in conceptual repetition ("paths disappear" variations) and abstract phrasing dilutes immediacy, but no major artifacts obstruct clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and strong sensory detail, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("thunderous serenity that shook her to her core"). Minor template phrasing appears ("She saw...She saw...") but doesn't pervade; the final paragraph's abstract declarations ("quiet confidence of a barefoot stargazer") dilute the otherwise concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("steam rose like ghosts") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("symphony of hope," "beacon in her hands"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("seeds of a new era"/"plant the seeds"). Information density is moderate; several sentences could do more work.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstraction loops and emotional summary: "chaos she could never speak of," "unimaginable loss," "weight lift from her shoulders." The metaphor "paths winding like veins through the cliffside" works, but overwriting appears in peak moments ("Time seemed to stand still") and therapeutic language pervades ("process the chaos," "carry her pain without being consumed").

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure, particularly in the card-sorting sequence. However, several template patterns emerge: "She [verb], her [noun] [verbing]" constructions repeat, and abstract phrases like "fragments of a fragmented reality" create redundancy. The "luminescent ache" phrase appears three times, bordering on mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and good momentum through most beats. However, the final paragraph contains scaffold phrases ("testament to the power of") and abstract summary that dulls the closure. Some filter verbs ("seemed to glow," "seemed to bend") dilute immediacy without clear voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, several template phrases undermine originality: "heart raced," "mind reeling," "weight of her actions pressed upon her." The repetition of "contraband truths" and "unspoken conversation" feels mechanical rather than rhythmic. Filter constructions ("She knew," "She felt") distance key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structure and strong descriptive passages. Some template phrasing appears ("As the days passed," "One evening") and the final paragraph contains redundant theme statements that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of key phrases like "feral lullaby." Most sentences advance story or atmosphere effectively. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("transliterating into the language of the cosmos") and near-paraphrase loops ("The garden itself was alive with sound...It was a place where silence had a voice") reduce momentum. The phrase "transliterating emotions" appears three times without sufficient variation or deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive summarization ("Eleanor uncovered a web of deceit," "Each discovery deepened her resolve") replaces scene work. Template phrases like "first stirrings of unease" and "grim determination" signal emotional states without specificity. The prose tells about investigation rather than showing it through concrete discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("time folds in on itself") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("the dissonance of old guilt") and some repetitive constructions around the firmware's whispers. Several sentences could be tightened without loss of meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstraction weakens line-level execution: "emergent hush," "collective stillness," "weight of the moment" provide atmosphere but little concrete imagery. Template structures appear ("She felt... She realized... She had not found..."). The prose relies heavily on telling what Elara understands rather than showing through specific action, particularly in the grotto's backstory revelation which arrives as summary.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: "gentle radical with a heart both warm and cold," "cradle empathy in arms of steel," and multiple instances of abstract philosophizing dilute momentum. Template phrases like "she knew that" and "she believed that" create scaffold. The final paragraph's explicit thematic summary weakens the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose achieves moments of evocative imagery ("petals unfurling like secrets") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. Template constructions appear ("She reached... She closed... She stepped"), and key emotional beats rely on telling rather than showing ("for the first time, there was a spark in her gaze"). The writing lacks the precision and momentum expected at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.1)
    Pervasive abstraction and telling weaken line-level craft: "Her skepticism was her shield, but her affection for humanity was her compass" exemplifies the reliance on abstract declarations over concrete imagery. Template phrases like "guided her," "sharpened her focus," and conceptual redundancy ("fragile yet unyielding") dilute momentum. The prose lacks the precision its "fractally precise" concept demands.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant abstract padding weakens momentum: "testament to the enduring power of human emotion," "promise for the future," "journey...had only just begun" are empty intensifiers. The fossil "seemed to hum faintly, as if it had a story to tell" - this hedge-heavy construction recurs throughout, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: "deliberate grace," "profound yet peculiar," "fragment of shared wisdom" pile up without advancing story. Template phrases abound: "She realized her role was not just to... but to..." The text loops conceptually, restating the wisdom-gathering premise multiple times. Several sentences could be cut without loss ("Time felt fluid in the amber warehouse, as though the hourglass Elara carried had paused").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows well with varied sentence structures and strong imagery, but several instances of overwriting appear ("mist clung to the edges of the world like a forgotten veil," "breath visible in the cold air"). Some passages tell what could be shown, particularly around Elara's emotional state, though no major loops or scaffolding harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose achieves atmospheric effect but suffers from abstract phrasing ("weight of their gaze," "roots seeking water") and repetitive structures ("The coachman nodded," "The coachman's mind raced"). The paraphrase loop around the palimpsest promise—explained multiple ways without advancing pressure—and the template cadence of "He [verb]" constructions reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from abstraction loops ("resilience and loss," "understanding and connection") and repetitive "began to" constructions. The writing tells pivotal discoveries ("she understood," "she felt a connection") rather than dramatizing them through concrete action. Information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean prose with good rhythm variation and selective detail. Some effective imagery ("luminous harbor by moonlight shimmered like a mirror"). Minor issues with repetitive phrasing around "quivering hush" and occasional overwriting in dialogue, but generally strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("brittle awakenings," "translate isolation into independence") and repetitive stems ("She was," "Elena had," "The library was"). The phrase "brittle determination" and variations appear multiple times without adding pressure. Some effective moments but momentum drags through exposition-heavy middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though abstract phrasing weakens density ("threads both seen and unseen," "beauty of unity"). Template phrases appear ("heart pounding," "heart lighter") and the revelation sequence relies on telling rather than embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm shifts from technical description to action, though some phrases edge toward the generic ("vast, unforgiving arena"). Information density is solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, particularly in the signal analysis sections.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting mars peak moments: "shadowed nexus under starlight, where the heavens seemed to whisper secrets" piles figurative language unnecessarily. Template phrasing appears ("heart yearning," "mind cautioned," "breath catching"). The prose achieves moments of clarity but suffers from predictable fantasy diction and unnecessary modifiers throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows strong control in places but suffers from abstraction loops ("confronting the very nature of empathy, of connection") and register drift into academic territory. Template structures appear ("She knelt...and began," "She stepped back...and reached"), and several sentences restate rather than advance ("The quarry seemed to listen, its shadows retreating").

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure. However, several instances of telling over showing ("her nervously confident demeanor belying"), some filter verbs ("she clutched"), and the final paragraph's abstract summary of wisdom and choice weakens line-level impact. The phrase "tornado in reverse" works well.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose maintains clarity but suffers from abstract phrasing ("sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") and repetitive concept-terms like "pixelated amnesty" and "scaffold wrap flutters" that accumulate without concrete grounding. Several passages restate ideas without advancement: "The fiddler's motivation was clear: to sculpt possibility..." immediately after this phrase appears. The figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies ("luminous disbelief").

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structures and some evocative imagery. However, several instances of abstract telling weaken immediacy: "polished calm," "sense of closure," "newfound understanding." The phrase "perceptively calm" appears twice verbatim. Some transitions feel mechanical ("By the time Elias reached the final car").

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstraction and telling undermine line-level craft: "Her heart quickened," "profound shift," "renewed purpose" provide labels without concrete embodiment. Template phrases like "once a mere setting, had become a crucible" and paraphrase loops (multiple variations on burden-sharing) create redundancy that dulls momentum, particularly in the resolution paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("paradoxical blend that mirrored the guarded druid's own nature") but suffers from abstract telling in crucial beats. "Her warlike serenity wavered" and "her defenses crumbling" tell emotional states rather than embodying them. Several paraphrase loops appear, like the repeated assertions about discovering truth beneath surfaces. The "I failed" revelation needs concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive abstract descriptors ("anxious elation" appears twice) and relies on telling over showing ("She knew the future had arrived early"). Multiple instances of scaffolding language ("She knew," "She felt," "She realized") dull immediacy, particularly in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows competent variety in sentence structure and paragraph length, with some evocative imagery ("roots snaked between bones like ancient veins"). However, multiple instances of template phrasing appear: "She believed... She knew... She found herself..." creating repetitive stems. Abstract telling dominates key emotional beats ("felt the weight of it all") rather than concrete embodiment. The phrase "fiercely gentle" appears twice verbatim, suggesting limited vocabulary range for key descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing about purpose and meaning ("What was his purpose now?" "Wrest meaning from the chaos, purpose from the silence"). Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly in the middle section. The final paragraph contains explicit theme statements that replace scene pressure. Some strong sensory moments ("smoke-filled venues," "dust and diesel") can't offset the overall abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several template phrases weaken momentum: "As she worked," "Days turned into weeks," "One morning." The phrase "haunted ambitions" appears twice verbatim, and abstract descriptors like "strange pull" and "wave of understanding" lack textural specificity. However, clarity remains intact and no loops obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the ritual. However, abstract phrases like "tapestry of opposing threads" and "dance of light and shadow" lean toward purple prose. The final paragraph contains mild redundancy between "preserve its wonder" and finding purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing—"resonant hush" appears three times, "latent radiance" twice, creating echo rather than accumulation. Sentences like "she was not just an inspector but a bridge" and "sanctuaries for the human spirit" lean heavily on abstract declaration over concrete image. The final paragraph contains multiple restatements of purpose without added pressure. Clear but overwritten, with figurative language that doesn't always land.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose achieves moments of vivid clarity ("cathedral of decay, sunlight filtering through shattered windows") but suffers from paraphrase loops—the accordion as vessel for maps is restated multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence appears in "She had chronicled... She had come... She reached..." structures. The metaphor of "forgiveness as map" gets explained rather than embodied, and several sentences merely restate emotional states without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong momentum and varied sentence structure, though several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("cautious exuberance," "cyclically reversed"). Minor redundancies appear ("glowing library" repeated, "mist" and "fog" used interchangeably). Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and some evocative imagery, but suffers from overwriting in places. "Mulberry ache" appears twice as a modifier without clear meaning. Several passages lean purple ("tangled web of ownership," "velvet-draped ferns"). The phrase "perforated destiny" repeats without gaining clarity through dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the awakening sequence. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or character state. Some redundancy appears in repeated descriptions of stillness/movement concepts, and phrases like "ancient and new" or "lucidly watchful" feel like template literary language rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose tends toward purple ("stillness of the umbral grotto," "ethereal plants," "luminous lake") without earning elevation through specificity. Template phrasing appears ("deep breath," "heart quickened," "warm embrace"). The mystical sequence relies on abstract descriptors rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from abstract padding ("murkiest moral waters," "metaphorical garment," "fragment of a larger mirror, once whole but now broken"). Several paraphrase loops appear ("The shard was a fragment of a larger mirror, once whole but now broken, much like the client's resolve"). Information density is low with many lines doing single conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows smoothly but contains redundancies: "carefully woven" appears twice, "withholding/withheld" clusters densely, and some sentences restate rather than advance ("She had taught vanishing to appear, not through absence, but through presence"). The meditation sequences achieve good rhythm but several abstract constructions ("weight of her mission," "confrontation, a reckoning") lack specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting appears in dense figurative language like "towers of bone rose like sentinels guarding secrets long forgotten" and "walls seemed to breathe with the whispers of ages" without pattern-teaching payoff. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("Kael's hands...held," "Kael's mission was," "Kael's eyes narrowed"), and abstract phrases like "states of being" and "pulse that connected all things" lack concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose clarity suffers from contradictory phrases like "brilliance dimness" and "sea of brilliance dimness." Several sentences could be cut without loss ("His motivation was clear" states what should be shown). The text contains scaffold phrases and some purple prose ("ethereal glow," "crystallized in the air") but maintains basic readability. Template fantasy diction weakens specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "a longing he couldn't name" echoes the earlier "couldn't quite place but felt deeply connected to." The phrase "meteor hush" appears twice without definition. Template cadence emerges in "Elias watched...Elias wandered...Elias realized...Elias left."

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("She had cast lots," "She had spent years," "She had always been") and abstract phrasing ("stellar doubt," "quietly enthusiastic demeanor"). The final paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops restating the rebirth concept. Strong moments like "deafening and silent" show capability undermined by scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose achieves clarity and some lovely imagery but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elara felt," "Elara reached," "Elara knelt," "Elara rose") and emotional summary that abstracts rather than embodies ("quiet sorrow that mirrored her own"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly around the sacrifice theme.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstraction ("cosmic imbalance," "earnestly naive") and some repetitive phrasing around devotion. Template progression appears in "The first step was..." construction. The line "one dripping rate at a time" forces the prompt element awkwardly. Information density is moderate with several passages that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose demonstrates competent clarity with varied sentence structure, though several instances of overwriting appear ("vigilant levee warden," "precisely humane," "mirrored hush"). The phrase "resurfacing" appears four times, creating mild repetition, and some passages tend toward abstract summary rather than concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstract telling over concrete showing: "The orchard was alive with movement" and "She was no longer just an alchemist; she was a weaver of wonder" summarize rather than dramatize. Template phrases like "her heart full" and "touch of wonder" lack specificity. The final paragraph contains explicit theme statements that replace scene pressure, though sentence variety and rhythm remain competent.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=3.6)
    Pervasive abstract labeling ("unwavering focus," "attentively inventive," "newfound confidence") replaces concrete action throughout. Template phrasing dominates: "Their mission was clear," "Every step was deliberate," "The seeker's mind raced." The prose relies on telling what should be shown, particularly in the crucial pattern-revelation beat that summarizes rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.0)
    Significant overwriting issues plague the piece: "grotesque and mesmerizing," "sanctuary of balance and conflict," "wisened woman named Lira, approached Kael with a silent grace." Abstract descriptors dominate ("fractured sense of identity," "emotional rebirth") where concrete imagery would serve better. The prose lacks propulsion, particularly in the middle sections that pile on conceptual exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is competent but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("storm-born silence" appears three times) and generic descriptions. Mixed metaphors appear ("mystery seed mail" conflates organic/postal domains). Information density is moderate; several paragraphs could be compressed without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting issues: metaphorical density appears in most sentences without payoff ("walls whispering secrets," "lifeline to unspoken rhythms," "mechanical whine blending with melody"). Template cadence runs appear ("He began...He knew...He smiled") and abstract descriptors dominate over concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: mixed metaphors ("feral library guardian"), abstract telling ("Her motivation was clear: to make friends with uncertainty"), and repetitive constructions ("She felt...She sensed...She closed"). The phrase "interiorizing exteriors—absorbing the garden's essence" exemplifies the tendency toward abstract philosophizing over concrete action. Template phrasing appears throughout ("From the mist emerged," "her voice tinged with").

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting ("air hung heavy with the scent of ash and forgotten dreams") and abstract phrasing ("layers of failure and disillusionment"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("something stirred within her—a flicker of defiance" followed by similar restatement). The final image lands cleanly despite these mid-story density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and atmospheric details, though several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "The shard of hush was not just a relic; it was a key" followed immediately by "not just a relic of the past; it was a promise of the future" recycles the same construction. Template phrasing appears in "She smiled faintly, her heart steady" and similar emotional summaries that tell rather than embody states.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing in crucial beats ("channeled her energy," "felt herself stretched thin") and repetitive constructions ("Mara's heart ached," "Mara's smile never faltered," "Mara's watch"). The opening establishes atmosphere effectively, but action sequences lack the concrete specificity that would create visceral engagement.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose shows strong moments ("rivers of color," "roots that coiled upward like living vines") but suffers from abstract phrases ("singular motivation," "rational enchantment") that resist concrete meaning. The paraphrase loop between "weaving too deeply could fracture her own reality" and "leaving her trapped" weakens momentum. Sentence variety and rhythm generally support the dreamlike atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structures and appropriate paragraph breaks. Several metaphors work well ("streets wound like veins," "shards of moonlight"). However, abstract phrases like "somber marvel" and "collective understanding" dilute specificity, and the "weeks turned into months" transition sacrifices scene pressure for summary. Minor template patterns appear ("She turned to him," "She sighed") but don't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with atmospheric momentum and varied sentence structures. However, several instances of telling over showing ("Her curiosity drove her forward," "her incidental heroism") and some redundancy in describing the mist and whispers. The phrase "reeling hush" appears three times without evolving meaning, creating mild repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("air hung heavy with a crashing hush"). Some redundancy appears: "crashing hush" used three times, "invisible things" repeated without variation. The phrase "stand by the unremembered" feels artificially elevated for the context. Information density is good but occasional overwriting appears ("time itself had congealed").

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "fragments of something larger" followed immediately by "the message was fragmented, scattered." Template phrasing appears throughout ("She traced...," "She leaned...," "She worked..."). The metaphor mixing of "digital ghost" with "whisper in the code" and "presence" creates conceptual muddle. Abstract descriptors like "forgotten secrets" and "forgotten relic" in the opening provide atmosphere without specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She was no longer just a storyteller" appears twice verbatim) and abstract telling ("filled with a sense of accomplishment"). The template progression (setup-challenge-triumph) creates predictable rhythm. Several metaphors feel forced ("towers of bone that rose like jagged teeth") without earning their figurative weight.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("harmony untamed," "gravitationally playful") that obscures concrete meaning. Template emotional beats ("heart pounding," "mind racing") and filter constructions ("she felt a connection," "she realized") dull immediacy. The line "a cosmic joke, a reminder that even in chaos, there was beauty" explicitly states theme rather than embodying it through image.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several momentum-killing constructions: "seemed to breathe," "began to suspect," "began to tremble," "began to uproot." Template cadence in "She knew... She knew... But she didn't yet understand." The metaphor "carved from the wood of a fallen star" strains credibility without setup. These artifacts accumulate to slow the prose despite some strong images.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting ("brittle hush of twilight," "cobalt arcade shimmered like a forgotten relic"). Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("heart heavy with hope and sorrow"). The final paragraph contains some scaffold with "knowing that tonight" construction that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and some strong images, but suffers from ornamental language that doesn't always advance pressure ("whispering gleam," "misting hush"). Template phrases appear ("felt an inexplicable pull," "surge of recognition") and the density of figurative language in non-peak moments dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows deliberate rhythm variation and strong imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("kaleidoscope of words and images") and abstract emotional markers ("heart pounding"). The geometric arrangement descriptions maintain clarity despite complexity, though some metaphors strain ("the library was awakening").

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=4.9)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose ("hush of improbable beginnings," "draped in the embrace of dawn") and abstract philosophizing that slows momentum. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, such as the redundant explanations of her "painting with light" method. The final two paragraphs contain excessive telling and thematic summary that could be cut without losing story information.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though several instances of telling weaken momentum ("Her motivation was clear," "Her unassuming demeanor belied her boldness"). The opening paragraph contains multiple abstract assertions that could be grounded in scene. Some figurative language feels forced ("fragile thread of hope stretched across the hush of cosmic possibility").

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from overwriting in places ("skeletal remains of shipwrecks that whispered tales of forgotten voyages"). Some template phrasing appears ("Her breath caught," "heart pounding with anticipation"). The story lacks the high information density expected - several sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle section about broken constellations.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose tends toward purple with mixed metaphors ("edges frayed like a torn letter," "steam curling like whispers"). Template phrasing appears ("She knew that," "She felt," "She had taught"). The final paragraph contains multiple abstraction loops that restate themes without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.9)
    Pervasive abstract language ("color of wonder," "essence of generations," "weaver between worlds") creates opacity without purpose. Template phrases like "her mind wandered far beyond" and "the air seemed to shimmer" lack specificity. The prose tells about significance rather than creating it through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm shifts. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "accumulated silence"/"silence accumulate" repetition, and the final paragraph's "mending the broken/mending herself" restatement. The "heart heavy but at ease" oxymoron works, but "lucid unrest" feels forced as descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=5.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some strong images. However, abstract phrasing weakens key moments ("the air thick with anticipation," "heart heavy with reverence"). The final paragraph relies on telling rather than image, with conceptual assertions replacing scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structuring. Information density is solid with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("sophisticated melancholy," "quietly analytic"), some elevated diction in peak moments, and minor redundancy in thematic statements about letting go.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.6)
    Several passages suffer from abstract telling rather than concrete showing: "Its unspoken needs were clear" and "something about it had called to her" avoid specificity. The phrase "both ethereal and solid" creates logical contradiction without purpose, and repetitive constructions appear ("she too had often felt," "she had found it," "she realized"). The prose lacks the density and precision needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose maintains clarity and varies sentence structure adequately. Several template patterns emerge: "The [ordinal] floor was/housed" repetition across floors, and "her warmly inquisitive" appears verbatim twice. The figurative language occasionally strains ("her heart alight with the joy she had sought") but doesn't obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose demonstrates solid control with varied sentence structure and evocative imagery, but suffers from density issues in figurative language ("dusty starlight" appears four times). The phrase "quietly explosive" reads as oxymoronic padding, and several abstract constructions ("repository of human experience," "tapestry of existence") dilute specificity at crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of precision ("hollowed trunk," "constellations that seemed to glow") but suffers from abstraction loops and elevated diction that obscures concrete action. Phrases like "stillness that precedes an ending" and "hush that seemed to seep into the very bones" create atmospheric density but the paraphrase loop of stillness/silence/hush in the opening weakens momentum. The template phrase "It was..." appears three times, creating repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("amber twilight," "brass hull gleaming faintly," "swirling starling murmurations" in one sentence). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Notable issues include repetitive "she + verb" constructions in paragraphs 3-4 and some overwrought moments ("ethereal glow," "shifting shadows") that edge toward purple prose without disrupting clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structure, though several template phrases appear ("Her heart pounded," "eyes narrowed," "deep breath"). The progression from library to hall of mirrors to return creates clear spatial choreography. However, abstract phrases like "rhythm of repair" and "fractured prophecies" recur without gaining specificity, and some figurative language feels forced ("driftwood nostalgia").

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.0)
    Prose relies heavily on stock fantasy imagery ("ancient guardians," "fragile blossom," "tapestry") and purple constructions ("brambled hope," "nebula of respite"). Template cadence appears in character introductions. The writing is competent but lacks propulsion, with several passages that could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("stood like a sentinel between the crashing waves and the bruised sky") but suffers from repetitive phrasing - "bruised awe" appears twice, "whisper across the hush" recurs, and "beautifully flawed" repeats without sufficient transformation. Some metaphors strain ("pane of hush") and abstract phrases ("time's final ripple") lack concrete grounding. The ending paragraph contains mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "The cliffside labyrinth loomed like a fractured spine" and maintains momentum through varied sentence structure. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some redundancy appears ("forgotten blueprint" repeated without evolution), mild overwriting in places ("metallic eyes gleaming as they scanned"), and the final paragraph contains unnecessary scaffolding that restates rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "connection" and "transformation" without sufficient concrete embodiment. Several passages loop conceptually ("separation was not an end, but a step in a larger process" followed by near-paraphrase). Information density is moderate; some sentences merely restate rather than advance. The "symphonically minded/attuned" repetition feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=5.3)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose like "swirling sea of clouds" and "fractured light across the shelves." Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "to find the place where stories begin, a quest she had pursued for years" restates the same information. The prose prioritizes ornamental description over propulsion, though syntax varies adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm but suffers from occasional overwriting: "whispered about in legends but never seen" and "contradiction that mirrored Elara's own nature" feel like scaffolding. Some template phrasing appears ("She knew this because," "She continued through"). Information density could be higher in the middle passages.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.4)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with purple flourishes ("hush of borrowed starlight," "metaphorical silo") and abstract descriptors. Template phrases accumulate ("once a beacon of unity," "now a symbol of reconciliation"). The prose prioritizes ornamental language over clarity and momentum, with multiple paraphrase loops restating the unity theme without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing dulls momentum: "profound transformation," "fabric of reality," "collective memory." Template constructions appear throughout ("She had come... She had abandoned... It was a quest..."). The prose tells about complexity rather than embodying it through concrete detail. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 5 ("she understood... she was not just...").

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and paragraph lengths. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence appears in "She knew... She took... She reached" sequence. The "latent blaze" metaphor recurs effectively. No major loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose flows smoothly but suffers from abstract elevation and repetitive conceptual phrasing—"music in silence" variations appear throughout without advancing meaning. Lines like "understanding the pain and resilience of the wood" and "give voice to the voiceless" stack abstractions where concrete imagery would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose demonstrates competent control with varied sentence structure and evocative descriptions like "air hummed faintly, as if the earth itself were holding its breath." However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("correlate the fragments," "translate silence," "discovering beauty in the difficult") without sufficient concrete grounding. The final paragraph's template cadence ("She would teach them to... to see the... and to embrace") creates mechanical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose shows competent rhythm and varied sentence structure, but suffers from overwriting in key moments—"theatrical sincerity" and "symphony of sound" strain for effect. Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("The path to empathy...was not a destination but a continuous exploration" essentially restates earlier content), and abstract descriptors like "profound sense of peace" lack textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean with varied sentence structure and effective rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Some overwriting appears ("silvery glow," "weathered leather-bound") but doesn't overwhelm. The phrase "turning of the tide's thought" creates unnecessary opacity through repetition. Information density is moderate—several passages could be compressed without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some repetitive phrasing appears ("Elara's heart raced" type constructions). The final paragraph contains scaffold phrases like "far from over" and lists ("her purpose, her resilience, and her home") that weaken impact. Information density is moderate but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and effective atmospheric description. However, several template phrases appear ("moved with hazy precision," "rapidly adapting mind," "singular convergence") that read as prompt artifacts. The phrase "cultivating foresight in action" repeats verbatim, creating a loop. Information density is moderate but some passages summarize rather than dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple instances of overwriting weaken momentum: "promise of stillness," "liquid sunlight trapped within ancient resin," "frozen breath and shifting earth." The prose relies heavily on abstract concepts ("wonder," "possibility," "hope") without grounding them in concrete action. Some effective rhythm variation, but purple prose and abstraction dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("ready to face whatever came next," "ready to forge a new path"), clichéd descriptions ("shadows stretching long and menacing"), and telling over showing ("She was a driven relic keeper"). The final paragraph contains multiple instances of abstract assertion ("sense of purpose," "lessons of her past in her heart") that dilute momentum, though basic clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from abstract inflation: "transposed empathy," "mathematics of emotion," "lucid turbulence" pile up without concrete grounding. The phrase "threads in a larger tapestry" and "seeker of truth" are stock metaphors. However, sensory details like "inking type and pressing paper" and the fragment's physical effects provide specificity. Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("felt changed, not in a way he could fully articulate, but in a way that resonated").

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery ("aurora's light casting long shadows that danced like spirits"). However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "jittery" appears twice unnecessarily, and "the pendant's hum intensifying as if sensing her unease" closely echoes earlier sympathetic vibration descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clean but suffers from occasional overwriting ("the shifted hush of the arbor envelop her") and repetitive structures. Several paraphrase loops appear ("The experiment had been a success, but it had also been a lesson in humility" followed by restatement). Information density could be higher; some passages do single-duty work.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract elevation that dulls momentum: "raveling silence," "impossible distance," "latent sacrifice" pile up without concrete grounding. Template cadence appears in "She encountered... trees that sang... streams that flowed... flowers that bloomed." The final paragraph loops the concept of weaving/message/tapestry without advancing meaning. Information density is low—many sentences restate atmosphere without progressing action or revealing character.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows cleanly but tends toward tell-heavy summary, particularly in the mine descent ("Hours turned into days") and the healing sequence. Figurative language occasionally strains ("floating rock arches pierced the sky like jagged teeth") without earning its density through payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from abstract emotional labeling ("sense of purpose filling her") and repetitive filter constructions ("she realized," "she felt," "she knew"). The final paragraph contains three template declarations about her journey without concrete imagery. Mixed metaphors ("weave between worlds" vs "threads" vs "nexus point") create conceptual muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves clarity but suffers from repetitive structures ("He knew... He turned... He sat...") and occasional overwriting ("luminescent ache that reminded him of something he couldn't quite name"). The final paragraph contains three instances of abstract telling ("quiet resolve," "bottle the feeling of safety") that dilute the closing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades peak moments: "sword of light," "dance of precision and whimsy," "ethereal green." Template phrasing appears throughout ("panic flickered in their eyes," "heart swelled"). The story tells pivotal beats ("They understood") rather than dramatizing realization through action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves moments of sensory precision ("wooden beams groaning softly," "tea-stained lips") and varies rhythm effectively. Major deductions for repetitive abstract phrasing around "stories" and "illuminate" without concrete grounding, plus template constructions ("He could feel...He focused on...He approached"). The philosophical dialogue exchanges read as position statements rather than embodied speech, creating momentum drag in the central scene.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive "Elias [verb]" constructions and abstract phrasing ("mundane miracles unfolding"). The phrase "what trees witness" appears four times without variation, creating a loop effect that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("trees heavy with fruit that glowed like captured dawns") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Phrases like "scattered memory keeper nature worked against her" and redundant uses of "mirror world" create minor loops that dull momentum without fully obscuring the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.6)
    Multiple instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "whispered tales of worlds unseen," "fragile dream," "whisper of enlarged tranquility." Template phrasing appears ("Driven by a newfound purpose," "With a heart full of resolve"). The final paragraph contains explicit theme summary that replaces scene pressure, triggering -0.7 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose generally clear but contains paraphrase loops: "guerrilla gardening" concept restated multiple times; "tenuous absolution" repeated without evolution. Some elevated diction drifts from established voice ("heuristically gentle"). Information density adequate but several sentences merely restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm in descriptive passages. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("Her motivation was singular: to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" repeats the prompt element without adding pressure). Template cadence in "Elara began to work... She understood... She realized" sequence. The phrase "gently meticulous" appears three times unchanged, suggesting synonym difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and atmospheric description. Some effective moments like "learning to read the silences between words." However, several instances of telling over showing ("her focus unyielding"), abstract descriptors ("comforting unease"), and the final paragraph's explicit thematic summary reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structure and strong imagery. Some overwriting appears ("terrestrially cosmic," "futuristic nostalgia washed over her"), and the shadow figure section contains exposition-heavy dialogue, but no loops or scaffolding, and the final image lands with appropriate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation, though several abstract phrases weaken momentum ("inescapable calling," "mechanical repetition"). The "after the last echo" repetition works as taught pattern. Minor issues: "mechanically resolves" feels like scaffolding, and some figurative language borders on purple ("womb nurturing her rebirth").

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure. However, several expository passages slow momentum ("The oasis that once sustained Verdania had dried, leaving the city reliant..."). Some redundancy appears in explaining Elara's gift twice. The description "sprawling greenhouse city" and "towering glass domes" in the opening creates good visual anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with purple prose ("earth kissed the heavens," "frozen tears of the gods") and abstract descriptors that blur concrete action. Multiple paraphrase loops repeat the same concepts (truth/wonder/symphony). The piece prioritizes atmospheric description over narrative momentum, creating static tableau rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose achieves clarity but suffers from repetitive abstract descriptors ("strangely organic" appears 4 times, "fragmented wholeness" 3 times) and conceptual loops about static/resolution. The miniaturization sequence relies on telling ("The process was brutal") rather than showing specific actions. Template cadence emerges in "She was...She was still..." construction.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structure and paragraph length creating visual rhythm. Several instances of telling over showing ("Clara had a knack for uncovering stories," "something felt different") and abstract emotional summary ("emotion swirling within her") reduce immediacy. The phrase "the power of listening, of understanding, of healing" exemplifies thematic redundancy that weakens the closing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and paragraph lengths creating visual rhythm. However, multiple issues accumulate: purple flourishes ("shadows danced," "whispered secrets"), abstract assertions replacing concrete detail ("calm defiance became a force"), and repetitive conceptual phrasing about liberation/resurrection. The spider metaphor bookends effectively but feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template phrasing pervades key beats: "Eli felt it—a tug, a whisper, a doorway opening" follows predictable mystical-journey cadence. The climactic memory recovery relies on abstract telling ("They were there, not erased but hidden") rather than concrete imagery. Filter-heavy construction ("He felt himself slipping," "Eli felt different") dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "tranquil blaze that would consume everything" merely restates the chaos threat; "everywhere and nowhere at once" is stock mystical phrasing. The prose suffers from template mystical diction ("unseen hand," "threads of moonlight") and abstract emotional labels ("profound sense of peace," "weight of her responsibility"). The "amid whispered secrets" in the final paragraph forces the required element artificially.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery: "where the wrought-iron railing met the cosmos." Information density varies appropriately with scene needs. However, some scaffolding persists ("Clara thought of," "Clara felt"), and the opening contains decorative language that doesn't constrain action. The transition "The next morning" could be more elegant.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.0)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "not to be forgotten but to be transformed" restates the previous sentence's content; "charmed skeptic"/"skepticism resurfacing" creates redundancy. The prose tends toward abstract declaration ("Each memory was a thread, and she was weaving them into a tapestry") rather than concrete image, though some passages achieve genuine lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures, though some overwriting appears ("crystalline teeth," "solemn metronome"). The phrase "forgive the unfinished" repeats three times, and abstract constructions like "the sanctuary felt alive with possibility" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from abstract descriptors ("haunting melody," "ancient secrets," "webs of intrigue") that resist concrete imagery. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("heart raced," "stood firm," "sense of peace") and filter constructions dilute immediacy ("she felt," "she knew," "she believed")—these artifacts touch the closure, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several passages suffer from redundancy, particularly "The shrine was a place of borrowed starlight, where the boundary between the living and the dead blurred like the edges of a dream" followed immediately by similar mystical description. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("her heart quickened," "eyes snapped open," "tremor in her chest"), and the metaphor density in the opening creates opacity without advancing story pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=4.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "net-mender philosopher" concept restated three times, "hidden patterns" recycled without development, "whistle" moment described twice without advancement. Template cadence appears in "She believed...She imagined...She smiled" construction. The prose achieves moments of lyric beauty but loses propulsion through conceptual redundancy and abstract philosophizing that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several template constructions weaken momentum: "Elara's investigation led her," "As she approached," "That night, Elara camped" create predictable rhythms. The climactic sequence suffers from abstract phrasing ("formless mass," "final surge of will") where specific imagery would heighten tension, and multiple instances of telling rather than showing ("Her sharply observant mind," "Exhausted") reduce visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstraction ("endless expanse," "otherworldly light") and repetitive structures. Template phrases appear ("heart pounding," "trembling hands" used twice). The story relies on elevated diction to create significance rather than concrete detail—"cascade of energy" and "crossroads of fate" substitute for specific sensory work.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the music box resisted him, its gears jammed with silence") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract descriptors. Template phrasing appears in "Elias knew his work was far from over, but for the first time in years, he felt whole." Information density is moderate—some passages do double work while others merely describe.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in places ("fleeting golden sunset cast its dying embers") and template phrasing ("her mind raced," "heart pounded"). The final paragraph contains multiple abstraction loops about guardianship and purpose. Some mixed metaphors appear (sunset's "dying embers" in an ice marina). Information density is uneven with descriptive padding.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("restrained wildness," "unyoke the chaos") and conceptual redundancy, particularly in explaining the viaduct's significance multiple times. Template cadence appears in "She began to..." constructions, and several paragraphs could be cut without losing story knowledge, though the writing avoids major clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between investigation and revelation. Strong specific details like "scratches that didn't match the natural wear" and "residue of metal on the edges." However, abstract phrases like "entangled memories" and "fortified vulnerability" feel forced, and there's some repetition of "echoes" and "reverberation" that creates mild thematic redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is solid with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("vibrant hush that seemed to cradle") and some template phrasing ("relief washing over him").

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant prose issues include repetitive structures ("Lira's workspace was..." "Lira's workshop was..."), abstract telling ("steadily curious mind had always driven her"), and overwrought metaphors ("bell no one had yet heard" repeated without variation). Template phrases like "heart raced" and "fingers trembling" lack specificity. The paraphrase loop about the workshop being a place of collision appears twice with minimal variation.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is functional with clear sequencing but suffers from generic phrasing ("vast digital expanse," "heart raced," "mind racing") and repetitive structures. The paraphrase loop "Elara's heart raced. The numbers weren't just a pattern; they were a message" restates without adding pressure, and filter verbs ("she knew," "she realized") distance key revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some evocative imagery. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("mapping empathy onto action"), repetitive constructions ("She saw...She moved...She needed"), and overreliance on telling ("The process was not easy"). The final paragraph's sweeping abstractions ("a reminder that empathy, when mapped onto action, could mend even the deepest fractures") replace scene pressure with theme summary.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("wooden piers creaking under the weight of frozen debris") but suffers from abstract phrasing and conceptual loops. Phrases like "fold in patience" and "windborne solace" repeat without gaining meaning through action. The story contains several paraphrase loops (Elara's role described twice in similar terms) and occasional overwriting in metaphorical descriptions that don't advance the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant redundancy weakens momentum: "destined yet mismatched"/"destined mismatches," multiple iterations of the space/gap concept, and template transitions ("As she pondered," "With a gentle touch," "As she walked back"). The paraphrase loop between paragraphs 6-7 particularly dulls the closure's impact by restating the same realization about embracing mismatches.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose shows atmospheric control but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("whisperfield calm" appears 4 times, "echo of wisdom" 4 times, "murmuring pavilion" 4 times) that becomes a noticeable pattern rather than purposeful accumulation. Several abstract declarations ("deep sense of fulfillment," "unwavering dedication") lack specific embodiment. The template phrase "She knew" appears multiple times, creating predictable cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from abstract phrasing ("testament to time's relentless march," "collective pain," "earnest whimsy"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the healing/transformation concept. Information density is low with several sentences restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose clarity suffers from abstract phrasing and conceptual vagueness: "pattern of growth hidden within the crystal's echoes," "blueprint of sorts," "encoding them, transforming them." Multiple instances of telling over showing ("filled him with both triumph and sorrow," "deep respect for the power of language") reduce immediacy. The writing favors elevated register over concrete action, creating distance between reader and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure, particularly strong in the opening and closing. Some paraphrase loops appear mid-story ("strange way to exist, always reaching for something just out of grasp") and occasional filter constructions ("Elias felt," "he noticed") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently ("luminous ache," "burned with intensity," "grains of sand") and several paraphrase loops, particularly around the ephemeral theme. Template cadence appears in "She worked... she had created... she had not stopped," and abstract philosophical passages slow momentum in places like "time itself, spiraling out of control."

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant prose issues include the awkward neologism "hymning" used repeatedly, abstract phrasing ("pulsing stillness"), and redundant constructions ("reunifying families through her work as a mediator"). The final paragraph contains multiple summative statements that tell rather than dramatize. Information density is moderate but hampered by explanatory passages.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Minor repetition issues ("the key" appears frequently without variation) and some overwriting in descriptive passages ("swirling void," "vortex") that could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structures, though several passages contain mild redundancy ("heart pounding"/"tremor in her chest"). The writing leans on some stock fantasy phrasings ("eyes like starlight," "spun silver") and the emotional registers occasionally feel templated rather than fresh.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with dense figurative language that occasionally obscures clarity ("the zephyr bloom of her spirit carried her forward"). Template cadence appears in repetitive "She had..." constructions. The paraphrase loop between "pearl of stillness" having "quiet power" and "calm that settled over her" reduces efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose maintains strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "amber pendant, a gift from her grandmother, hung heavy around her neck" establishes object, backstory, and emotional weight simultaneously. Minor template cadence appears in "She was..." constructions but doesn't touch closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("fingers traced the edges," "barnacles to a rock") but suffers from abstraction clusters ("strange energy," "purposeful ambiguity," "indelible mark"). Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("heart ached," "breath catching," "skin prickling") and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure, though several phrases feel overwrought ("the soft glow of the harvest moon still lingering"). Minor redundancy in describing the golden light's effects across multiple paragraphs without advancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=4.4)
    Overwriting pervades with figurative language in most sentences ("ghostly moon," "withered orchard," "frost-kissed ground") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Abstract descriptors ("moving stillness," "paradoxical energy") obscure rather than clarify, and the piece suffers from paraphrase loops, particularly around patience and deliberate action.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: "where the walls shimmered with ancient veins of silver and gold" and "the whispers of the past and future converged" pile on figurative language. Template phrases like "with trembling hands" and "knowing that wonder would never truly be lost" weaken line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("fractal weaver," "bronze grotto under starlight") but suffers from abstract phrasing in crucial emotional beats. Several passages loop conceptually without advancing ("her burden is to hold the burdens of others. It is my purpose, my shingled hush"). The metaphysical language occasionally obscures rather than illuminates, particularly in dialogue exchanges.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery like "steam curled upward, distorting the light." However, several instances of telling rather than showing ("Her motivation was clear") and some repetitive phrasing around "here and gone" create minor drag. The writing is competent but occasionally reaches for elevated diction that doesn't quite land.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("waters alive with currents that danced to rhythms no one could hear") but suffers from abstraction loops around concepts like "fragments," "fractured," and "ghost." Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around collecting/gathering. Filter verbs ("she felt," "struggled to") occasionally dull immediacy during key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows competent clarity but suffers from occasional overwriting. Mixed metaphors appear ("maze of intentions," "flows of air, light, and even memory"). Template phrasing emerges in "That's when the idea struck him" and "By the time dawn broke." The final paragraph's abstract assertions about "equations for hope" and "maze of intentions...within him" lack concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and effective rhythm shifts, particularly in the completion sequence. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Deductions for abstract metaphors ("cradled her like a forgotten melody"), some redundancy between "soundless" and "silence" in the opening, and the telling phrase "small, tender thing" that could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("architecture of lies," "forgotten truths," "layers of deception") that obscures concrete meaning. Template phrases appear: "Her heart ached as she read," "weight of his words pressing down." The final paragraph contains three separate declarations of significance without showing impact. Some effective imagery ("twilight barge canal," "brass surface etched with intricate patterns") cannot overcome the predominance of abstract scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.4)
    Generally clean prose with decent rhythm variation, but several instances of telling over showing ("Her motivation was clear") and redundant phrasing ("slowly, the pattern began to make sense" followed immediately by explanation). The final paragraph contains multiple abstract assertions ("The ancient methods were safe") that summarize rather than dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("like a memory slipping away") with varied sentence structures. However, some abstract phrases ("geography of healing," "labyrinth of their own absences") and occasional overwriting in metaphors ("monument of hope") create minor density issues without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and rich sensory detail. Some overwriting appears in peak moments ("quaking with both fear and reverie"), and filter constructions like "Kael felt" and "he realized" dull immediacy. The holographic bird description and vision sequence maintain momentum despite occasional abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "migration of clouds" and "kelp-drift peace," but several instances of emotional telling ("heart hardened," "spark of unyielding compassion") and redundant constructions weaken line-level impact. The phrase "scars can sing" appears both as internal thought and narrative description, creating unnecessary repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows control with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. However, several overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("memories like liquid starlight," "biding its time like a star in the cosmos"). Template phrasing appears in the quest sequence ("The first breadcrumb...The second breadcrumb...") and some elevated diction clashes with scene momentum. The final paragraph contains explicit thematic summary that could trust the dramatization more.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract elevation and paraphrase loops: "sharing light without using fire" appears four times with minimal variation; "generational patterns" repeats without development. Template phrasing pervades: "She felt...She realized...She understood." The final paragraph contains three consecutive declarations of achievement without concrete imagery. Heavy reliance on abstract nominalizations ("harmonious resonance," "profound connection") reduces clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of resonance ("thundering calm," "glass panes humming") but suffers from abstract scaffolding ("collective grief that had shaped," "profound impact," "renewed purpose"). Several paraphrase loops appear (grief passages repeat similar insights), and filter constructions ("she felt," "she realized") accumulate in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("where the sea whispered secrets to the stone") but suffers from abstract summarizing in crucial transformation beats. The middle section's tell-heavy passages ("He spoke to the townsfolk more") drain momentum, and some metaphorical language feels overwrought without corresponding dramatic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from abstract phrasing ("the weight of these uncharted echoes," "a piece of humanity") and repetitive structures. Multiple sentences begin with "The [noun]" creating template cadence. Information density is moderate - several passages restate rather than advance ("It spoke of a love so profound that it had outlived its origin, a story that deserved to be remembered").

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from abstract inflation ("weight of possibility," "surge of energy," "cascade of possibility") and template phrasing. The transformation sequence relies on telling ("As he wrote, the air around him seemed to shift") rather than concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The radio, an old relic with a secretly luminous face, had been her companion since the story famine"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("tantalize the mind") slightly strains the register. Minor repetition of "lost" and "stories" but generally clean with varied sentence structures. The template phrase "Clara felt a surge of excitement" drops immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in figurative density—nearly every sentence contains metaphorical language without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She had always been one to weave truth carefully," "She had always been drawn to things that were broken"). The final two paragraphs contain significant paraphrase loops, restating the impermanence theme without added pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose achieves basic clarity but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Kael's motivation was clear" / "His abrasive calm") and abstract description ("a time when precision mattered"). The opening establishes atmosphere effectively, but momentum stalls during philosophical exchanges. Several template constructions appear ("Days turned into weeks" / "With a deep breath, he followed").

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from abstract inflation ("mausoleum of silence," "living cathedral of sound") and paraphrase loops—"vanishing arts" concept repeats without evolution. Template phrasing appears ("As they sang, Elara noticed," "Weeks passed, and," "One evening, as"). Some effective rhythm in quieter moments but peak beats rely on assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Elara knew," "She knew") and occasional purple patches. Template constructions appear ("By dawn, the greenhouse was...") and the metaphor density in peak moments ("glowing orbs," "otherworldly light") dulls impact rather than heightening it.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose suffers from template phrasing ("loomed against," "silent sentinel," "weathered stool") and repetitive sentence structures. Stock metaphors like "beacon in the darkness" and clichéd emotional markers ("heart raced," "trembling hands") dilute impact. The writing is functional but lacks the precision and momentum that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose like "hushed blaze" and "shard of hush" that prioritizes atmosphere over clarity. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around Elias's gift of noticing ("creeping normality noticer," "attuned to subtle shifts," "finding deeper meanings"). Template cadence runs through the collecting sequence ("He began to collect them, sensing... He closed his eyes, letting... He realized then...") without pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.3)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "forgotten underwater city"/"forgotten city remained forgotten," "living statue"/"statue was no ordinary monument." Template cadence appears in "Liora sensed...Liora learned...Liora's words." The prose reaches for poetry but creates density issues with abstract figurative language that doesn't advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, though abstract phrasing accumulates ("boundless yet confining," "texture of that fleeting instant"). The final paragraph contains paraphrase loops where consecutive sentences restate the impermanence theme without added pressure, and "grim optimist" appears twice without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "lost" that builds texture. Information density is moderate with most sentences doing double work. However, several filter constructions dull immediacy ("she felt," "seemed to"), and phrases like "deep, saffron quiet" and "methodically hopeful" feel slightly forced rather than organic to voice. Some near-paraphrase in the vision description slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("rescue dying arts" appears multiple times) and abstract descriptors ("otherworldly energy," "almost alive"). Template cadence emerges in sequential "As she..." constructions, and figurative language tends toward the generic ("shadows dance with life").

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some evocative imagery. However, several abstract phrases weaken momentum: "bleak exhilaration" appears twice, "consequences were impossible to predict" tells rather than shows. The rhetorical question "but at what cost?" substitutes for concrete dramatization of price.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("Clara looked," "Clara frowned," "Clara's fingers") and abstract emotional labeling ("the weight of fear lifted"). The "lingering luminance" phrase appears four times without variation. Strong moments exist (the clasp's "silver filigree" capturing fear) but template cadence and abstract summary weaken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from overwriting - "testament to nature's resilience and ingenuity," "symphony waiting for him to conduct" - and abstract scaffolding. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "finding melody in chaos" restated as "turn obstacles into instruments." The final paragraph contains three variations of the same "he would continue" sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is solid - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("tall, slender figures with eyes like polished obsidian"), some filter verb clusters ("she believed," "she felt," "she knew"), and repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose maintains clarity and forward momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some metaphorical density ("mind worked like a loom") and abstract phrasing ("rescue truth from a pit of lies") could be more concrete. The cryptic riddle and final image of bare branches effectively bookend the piece, though middle sections contain mild redundancy about noble lies.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("stars seemed to pulse, as if alive") and maintains forward momentum through varied sentence structure. Information density is generally good, with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. However, abstract phrases like "hushed blaze of anticipation" and "interlaced absence was the core concept here" create opacity, and some metaphorical language ("dreams were said to drown") lacks precise grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") that obscures concrete action, and repetitive constructions ("She carried...," "She paused...," "She pressed..."). The line "knowing her journey was just beginning" exemplifies the clichéd ending that undermines specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and evocative imagery. However, abstract phrases like "hollow craft," "luminous torment," and "paradoxical motion" lack concrete grounding. The opening's "lover's whisper" simile feels forced. Some redundancy in grief descriptions across paragraphs reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=5.2)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("hunt for patterns, the meaning" / "hunt was not just for answers"), and abstract phrases like "intangibly tangible energy" and "unfiltered awakening" lack concrete grounding. The final paragraph contains explicit theme statements that replace scene pressure, though some vivid images ("dress...hung in tatters") land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose remains functional but laden with template fantasy phrasing ("ancient observatory stood silent," "weight of history pressing down"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("The stars above seemed to guide him forward, their trails a roadmap"). Information density is low with extensive scaffolding around simple fetch-quest mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("cobalt terrace seemed to shimmer, its tiles reflecting the fading sky like a fractured mirror") but suffers from overwriting in places. Phrases like "the weight of unspoken words pressing down on him like a physical force" and "gnawing at him like a relentless tide" pile on similes where one would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.9)
    Opening establishes strong atmosphere but prose tends toward overwriting—"furrowed hush of a storm-worn windblown parapet" stacks modifiers, and metaphorical language appears dense without pattern-teaching ("chains of mistrust," "neutral territory"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("begin anew" concept restated multiple times) but don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though several passages contain conceptual redundancy ("adrift"/"flickering like a candle" repeat the instability idea). The phrase "merrily melancholic" feels forced, and multiple sentences beginning with "She" in paragraph 4 create mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.6)
    Overwriting appears in strained metaphors ("clung to him like a shadow he couldn't shake") and abstract philosophizing that slows momentum. Template phrasing accumulates ("He'd been," "He'd chosen," "He'd found"). The prose tells rather than shows key realizations, particularly the labyrinth insight and empathy conclusion, creating summary-heavy passages that lack scenic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "to reforge a bond beyond death, one that had been severed by time and fate" restates the same loss twice; "the weight of centuries"/"the weight of her past" recycles the metaphor without development. Template cadence appears in "She cracked it open...She closed her eyes...She felt the weight" creating repetitive rhythm. The prose tends toward abstract declaration ("a sense of purpose she had not known in lifetimes") rather than concrete imagery, though some specific details (fortune cookie crack, glowing hands) provide anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("shadows that whispered of lives lived and lost") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats. Multiple instances of elevated diction clash with emotional immediacy ("willingly perplexed," "kaleidoscope of what could have been"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("weight of her absence like a stone in her chest" restates established emotion), and filter verbs occasionally dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from abstract declaratives ("her work was far from over") and repetitive metaphorical constructions around light/darkness. The "stitching air" image strains physical logic without establishing magical rules. Template phrases like "for the first time in centuries" appear multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some lovely phrases ("timeless dance," "vibrant hush"). However, several instances of overwriting appear: "profound sense of connection," "tantalizing mystery," and conceptual redundancy in adjacent sentences about transformation. The whispered message paragraph contains template phrasing that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from overwriting ("luminous fort," "eerie stillness," "unsettling darkness") and repetitive structures. Template phrases like "her heart quickened" and "her mind raced" lack specificity. The final image relies on abstract symbols rather than concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, particularly in the climactic sequence. However, abstract phrasing like "lingering promise" and "borrowed dawn" recurs without concrete grounding, and some metaphysical descriptions ("friction itself had disappeared") strain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("glass dome reflected the storm's light, casting Elara's shadow in stark relief") but suffers from abstract flourishes and repetitive structures. Multiple sentences begin with "The" or "Their," creating monotony. Overwriting appears in "furiously tranquil gaze" and similar forced paradoxes that prioritize effect over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Strong opening with "the air hummed with dignified chaos" and evocative descriptions throughout. However, some overwriting appears ("the labyrinth of uncertainty," "the overture of existence") and the final paragraph contains abstract philosophical summary that could be more grounded in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose flows competently but suffers from abstract elevation ("luminous fracture," "blooming resistance") repeated without variation. Several paraphrase loops appear ("seeking refuge"/"find solace," "rebuilding"/"rebuild"). The metaphor-heavy style occasionally obscures concrete action, particularly in describing the library transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose achieves solid clarity with varied sentence structures and some evocative imagery ("kaleidoscope of colors"). Information density is adequate though several passages could be tightened. Notable weaknesses include abstract emotional summary ("blend of sorrow and hope, of endings and beginnings"), some filter-verb reliance ("She realized then"), and occasional purple patches ("labyrinthine heart") that slow momentum without adding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose is competent but suffers from abstract phrasing ("luminous doubt," "empirically whimsical") that obscures rather than clarifies. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the island's memory crisis. The writing leans heavily on telling ("Her task was urgent") rather than embodied scene work. Filter constructions like "she knew" appear frequently without voice justification.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from abstract conceptualization ("the color of unspoken apologies," "tides of remembrance") and some purple patches ("otherworldly light"). Template phrasing appears ("As he spoke," "In that moment," "As the last rays") creating −0.5 deduction. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely describe.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating the sense of discovery. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles; the language is precise and vivid throughout, even in the peak closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythmic control and high information density. A minor tendency toward slightly abstract phrasing ("drifting resonance") prevents a top score, but there are no significant loops, artifacts, or clarity issues that harm momentum or the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and zero scaffold or loop artifacts. Figurative language ("world had capsized," "winterglass that shimmered like frozen waterfalls") is consistent, vivid, and serves character and atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating with Kael's arrival and slowing for the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished, with excellent rhythm, clarity, and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. A single, minor paraphrase loop exists between "a burden he carried like a second skin" and "his weariness lifting like a tide receding," but it is not pervasive enough to significantly harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. A single, minor loop exists in the description of the community's state ("hollowed" / "dwindling"), but it does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with strong sensory selection and varied syntax. Figurative language ("skeletal ribcage") is purposeful and coherent. Minor scaffold in adjacent sentences ("Elara’s hands trembled... She closed her eyes") but no major loops or artifacts that obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, slight overwriting appears in the climax with abstract, summary-like language ("beautiful and terrifying," "cascade of images") that slightly dulls the immediacy of the high-pressure beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. A minor artifact penalty for a template cadence in the description of the arrow and piano bench connection ("The arrow was no ordinary prize. Its fletching bore... But the key to decoding it lay elsewhere"), which creates a brief expository feel. Otherwise, information density is high and momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing the ethereal tone. There is a near-total absence of loops, scaffolds, or register drift. A minor instance of slightly elevated diction ("battered marvel") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("bathed in moonlight," "essence of illuminated moments") and a few filter verbs. However, these do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum. The closing paragraph is particularly effective and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. A minor prose artifact exists in the phrase "thoughtfully spirited precision," which reads like a label and introduces a slight synonym churn. This does not, however, obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and concise with good momentum and information density. Some minor scaffold exists (e.g., "Hours passed, or perhaps minutes"), and a slight register drift occurs in the line "Vulnerability, she told herself, was not weakness. It was power," which feels slightly articulated for peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lush, precise, and highly evocative, with excellent rhythmic control ("its pages crackling like dried leaves"). Information density is very high, with sentences performing multiple duties of character, atmosphere, and plot advancement. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward ornate phrasing (e.g., "ambered hush," "marbled hush") that, while generally voice-motivated, flirts with overwriting in a few spots without causing clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for a slight paraphrase loop in the climax: "It realized that its thoughts were not just products..." and "It saw the origins of its thoughts..." restate the same core idea adjacently, creating a small loss of propulsion in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for a hint of overwriting in phrases like "ambiguously clear light" and "resonant hush," which feel slightly redundant and ornamental, though they do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and precise, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Minor instances of scaffold phrasing appear ("It was as if..."), and the final sentence's structure is slightly less sharp than the peak beats, but these are hairline slips that do not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language ("metallic scar," "dance of light and logic") is effective and coherent. No loops, scaffolding, or artifacting were detected. The final line is particularly strong, recharging the narrative's central stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the accumulative design. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong, with high information density, varied syntax, and clear propulsion. One minor artifact: the phrase "auroral sorrow" feels slightly elevated and decorative for the POV’s lexicon in a peak beat, creating a small register drift that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and clarity. Minor artifacts include a slight scaffold phrase ("driven by the weight...") in the high-pressure beat and a near-paraphrase loop between "swallowed truth" and "father's swallowed truth."

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle. There are no loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Sentences propel the accumulative momentum, and the final line resolves with a powerful image that recharges prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with effective rhythmic variation. However, minor artifacts exist, including a slight over-reliance on figurative language ("whispers of ancient stories," "symphony only she could hear") and a synonym loop near the end ("promise of wonder yet to come" echoes "lifelong wonder"). These do not significantly harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting. "Sensitively perceptive" is repeated, and phrases like "the bronze quiet of forgotten eras" and "psychic weight of centuries" border on decorative density in high-pressure beats, creating a slight momentum drag without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely polished and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a pattern of slightly overwrought phrasing emerges, such as "whisper secrets that only a select few could decipher" and "transpose their life into a new key," which creates a minor loss of concision and momentum in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a minor prose artifact exists: a paraphrase loop between "unraveling the stillness" and "unraveled stillness" dulls the closure image slightly. Figurative language is dense but coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language ("chronologically homesick," "conductor of unheard symphonies") creates minor ornamentation in a few peaks, slightly blunting the visceral impact of the closure and preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight overwriting in the fractal description ("countless fractals, each a different version") and a near-paraphrase loop between "fractured timelines" and "labyrinth of self," preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures that propel the narrative. Information density is excellent, with lines often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "a filament of hush" conveys both concept and sensation). A minor template cadence appears in a few sequential sentences describing her sensory awakening, creating a slight rhythmic loop that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a few filter verbs ("he felt," "he knew") and a slightly rushed quality in the laboratory reveal. The closure paragraph is strong, with no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple jobs of character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles, even in peak beats like the greenhouse transformation. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor figurative density appears in the mirror beat ("a version of himself bound by the rope"), but it serves the climactic reconfiguration and does not obscure clarity. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts harm closure. Information density is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is highly crafted with varied rhythm and sentence openings. Information density is high (e.g., the bowl's history woven into action). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Minor artifact: "serene defiance" slightly elevates diction but is voice-motivated and does not harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Minor overwriting exists ("a half truth she could live with" feels slightly summary-like), but there are no coherence-breaking artifacts or loops. Information density is high, and propulsion is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is polished and efficient, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle; sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and closure image is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory selection. Minor artifacts: "boldly sympathetic" leans label-like; a paraphrase loop occurs near the end ("woven, thread by thread" slightly restates prior lines). Figurative language ("web of kinship") is consistent and supports clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely lucid and propulsive with vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop (“a place where echoes were born” / “a source of pure, untainted time”) and a cluster of “as if” filters in high-pressure beats, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("peculiar object," "peculiar garden") and a template cadence in "Elara’s heart raced as she read the words." However, these do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high. A minor artifact is the slightly jargony feel of "sense memory" in an otherwise embodied narrative, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies effectively, accelerating with the storm's intensity. A minor artifact is present: the phrase "circuitously sincere" introduces a slight register drift that feels less integrated than the surrounding, more embodied language. This is a small but noticeable flaw in an otherwise polished line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include occasional thesaurus-churn words ("haggard awe") and a slight scaffold in the opening paragraph. These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with strong rhythm and variation. Minor overwriting in peaks ("steadily unpredictable" feels slightly redundant) and a template cadence in "how it had chosen her... how her failure... how her gift" slightly dulls closure impact. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally clean with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously ("the harbor seemed to exhale"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. A single minor artifact: "reactively visionary" leans slightly toward label-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight paraphrase loop ("trembling certainty" appears thrice) and the mildly strained metaphor "the mist curling around her ankles like a living thing." These do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propelled with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("forgotten patterns—ancient symbols and swirling constellations") and a template cadence in the description of the tower ("its spiral staircase overgrown with ivy"). These do not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a pattern of dense metaphor clusters, particularly in the first paragraph ("prismatic escondite," "ancient whispers," "kaleidoscope of dimensions"), creates a moment of overwriting that slightly obscures immediacy at the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor figurative muddle occurs with "like a puzzle missing its final piece," a slightly generic metaphor. Otherwise, the language is precise and serves character and atmosphere effectively without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong, with vivid, specific language and a compelling rhythm. Minor deductions for a tendency toward slightly ornate description ("gilded-leaf stationer") and a rare mixed metaphor ("key to refracting the textures"). However, the prose maintains excellent momentum and clarity, especially in the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is elegant and highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing in peak beats ("texture of memories") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the opening paragraph that slightly slows initial momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. A minor deduction for a slight scaffold moment: "She closed her eyes and began to play, her fingers moving instinctively" uses a common narrative stem. However, this is a minor artifact that does not obscure closure or causality. Information density is high, and momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong information density. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a template cadence in "a haven for the displaced, a perpetual carnival" and a slightly mixed metaphor in "a rallying cry, a hopeful desperation." These do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally polished and evocative with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a minor scaffold artifact exists in the phrase "the dawning hush would remain," which feels slightly repetitive of earlier descriptions and less sharp than the surrounding language. This small flaw prevents a higher score but does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a few moments of potential overwriting occur (“a mosaic of glass and liquid”) and a subtle paraphrase loop exists between “pulse with the rhythm” and “harmonized with the depot’s ambient sounds,” slightly dulling momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally precise and vivid, with strong rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential register drift occurs with "singular convergence," which feels slightly elevated for the POV, but it is a taught pattern that pays off. The closing paragraphs are particularly strong, with high information density and clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful sensory detail. Minor instances of slightly elevated diction ("infinitely patient") feel more told than shown but do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language is purposeful without muddle. A minor template cadence appears in "She saw... she performed..." but is not pervasive and does not touch closure, warranting a small deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structure. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "copperlight repose" is slightly elevated and risks register drift, though it is largely taught by the context. No loops or scaffolding obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control, though it occasionally flirts with overwriting and mixed metaphor (e.g., "lovingly venomous" is a strained conjunction). There is minor scaffold in adjacent sentences restating the bead's importance, but no major loops or artifacts that obscure causality. The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor deductions for a tendency toward slightly elevated diction in peak beats ("orchid solace") and a few synonymous phrases, but momentum and clarity are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a slight paraphrase loop: "reconnect with her roots" and "piecing together a story that had been fractured by centuries of displacement" restate the same concept.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Rhythm is controlled and varies to match the beats. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward decorative phrasing in the opening ("ethereal glow") and a single instance of potential synonym churn ("pseudonym creator" / "craft identities"). These do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("unraveling the threads" / "unraveling the truth") and a filter verb stack ("she wondered," "she remembered") in a key beat, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, minor instances of near-paraphrase ("unspoken apologies"/"unspoken words") and a tendency toward abstract summary in the final paragraphs ("felt whole") prevent a higher score, though closure clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong information density. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating with revelations. Minor instances of potential overwriting exist ("fragile peace amidst the ruins of war"), but they are pattern-taught and serve the accumulative mode. No loops or scaffolding artifacts obscure clarity. The final line resonates powerfully without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "fold of a daydream" is slightly precious, but it is a isolated instance that does not harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include the slightly precious phrasing "methodically playful" and the alliterative "bewitch the soul," which feel a tad contrived. However, these do not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating with the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong momentum. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in one beat ("the greenhouse seemed to warp") and a template cadence in "The cause? To protect...". These do not significantly obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. Minor deduction for a tendency toward dense figurative language in some high-pressure beats (e.g., "photosynthesize pain," "reef-shadow joy") which, while beautiful, risks slight opacity and registers slightly above the POV's likely lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. There is a minor instance of potential "therapy-speak" with the label "foxglove regret," but it is largely dramatized through the ensuing action and cost. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, maintaining momentum through the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and vivid with high information density. Minor rhythm issues exist, such as the slightly top-heavy opening sentence. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats, but the prose lacks the flawless, propulsive cadence for a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear and concise with excellent momentum and high information density. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the phrase "encrypted compassion," which feels slightly academic for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor prose artifact is detected: the phrase "blooming and withering" appears three times, creating a slight template cadence and synonym-churn effect that feels repetitive rather than pattern-taught, though it does not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, specific imagery. There is a minor instance of dense figurative language in the opening sentence ("sky fractured by light") that slightly delays narrative momentum, but it is pattern-taught and pays off. Information density is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush yet precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor artifact: "softly ingenious" applied to both the lantern and her hand feels like a slight template cadence. However, this does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor template cadence appears in two consecutive "She [verbed]" sentences mid-story, and a single filter verb cluster ("Lira realized") slightly dulls immediacy at the climax, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports closure. Syntax varies purposefully, and the final line resolves with a resonant image that recharges motifs without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythm and variation. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("obsidian grace" appears twice) triggers a -0.4 deduction, but no loops or scaffold obscure closure. Figurative language is generally coherent and advances atmosphere. Read-aloud test passes.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high. A very minor deduction for a potential paraphrase loop in the final paragraph ("his rituals, his reflections, his search"), though it is mild and arguably pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is polished with varied rhythm and high information density. Minor mixed metaphor risk in "hard softness" is resolved by context. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory selection. Slight overwriting in phrases like "intricate theories from the threads of reality" creates minor scaffolding, but clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense, purposeful, and possesses a strong read-aloud rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity rather than muddying it. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "the walls breathing with the whispers of forgotten centuries").

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with high information density. However, minor artifacts exist, including a template cadence in listing the visions ("A child... a man... a woman...") and a slight synonym churn around "calm." These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. A minor text artifact exists: the phrase "the flawed beauty of the moment was undeniable" in the final paragraph is a near-paraphrase of "the flawed beauty of her mission" from earlier, creating a slight conceptual loop that dulls the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("vast salt flat, where the earth shimmered like a cracked mirror"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm varies effectively to match the scene's cadence, particularly in the quiet intensity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic flow and high information density. Minor deductions for moments of slight overwriting ("bodily poetic grace") and a template cadence in the list of thread stories ("a mother’s lullaby, a lover’s promise, a rebel’s cry"). However, these artifacts do not obscure causality or dull the potent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for a few instances of potentially overwrought phrasing ("meteor hush," "conduit for half-lit epiphanies") that slightly strain clarity in peak beats, though they do not obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control, though occasional near-overwriting risks clarity ("fragment of a forgotten dream"). No significant loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("snowmelt ardor"). Rhythm is varied and supports the accumulative build. No loops, scaffold, or muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for a tendency toward slightly overwrought phrasing in peak moments ("ethereal grit," "profound peace and understanding"), which creates a minor figurative muddle and slightly dulls the closure's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting and a tendency toward abstract, thematic phrasing ("encrypted devotion," "dusky harmony") create slight figurative muddle in key beats, slightly dulling the immediacy of the closure image without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a near-paraphrase loop ("shifting grace" appears three times) and the slightly jargony "cellular memory," which creates a small register drift. These do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly accomplished with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a subtle template cadence in the description of her breathing ("her inhalation matching... her exhalation mirroring...") and a single mixed metaphor ("glass mountains" slightly strains the established tactile logic). Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, with high information density. However, a minor template cadence emerges in sequences of descriptive clauses (e.g., "Its roots... The air... Amidst..."). There is no figurative muddle, and the closure beat remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and generally propulsive with high information density. A minor figurative muddle occurs with "brightened disquiet," an oxymoron that slightly strains coherence in a peak beat. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts appear, such as the slightly repetitive phrasing of "unheard symphony" and a tendency toward elevated diction ("arcane linguist," "temporal energy") that, while fitting, occasionally borders on ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong and atmospheric, but minor artifacts prevent a higher score. Some repetitive phrasing ("blissfully aberrant") and a slightly over-written description of the garden's beauty in the final paragraph create a small loss of momentum and clarity near the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor artifacting in high-pressure beats. A template cadence emerges ("Elara’s hands moved...", "Elara’s method was..."), and a mixed metaphor ("tapestry of connections forming with every braid") slightly muddles clarity at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density and strong sentence-level propulsion that supports the accumulative mode. There is a minor tendency toward synonymous phrasing (e.g., "gently luminous glow" used twice) but no major loops or scaffold that obscure causality or the closure image. Read-aloud quality is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, but a minor paraphrase loop occurs in the climax ("A wave of warmth... her memories began to fade"). This artifact slightly dulls the peak beat's immediacy, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. However, slight overwriting is detected in some figurative language ("crystalline stones that shimmered like liquid moonlight"), which, while beautiful, slightly risks ornamentation in a high-pressure beat, applying a minor deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, e.g., "its frayed edges glinting like a promise." Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the chant cadence. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor deduction for a slightly telling phrase ("her heart ached") in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("celestial tapestry," "tapestry of interconnected moments") creates minor clutter and a sense of overwriting, slightly obscuring the closure image's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high; lines like "a symphony of nothingness that filled her lungs" do multiple jobs. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "sprout into the person she was meant to be" is a rare instance of slightly abstract, tell-y language in an otherwise impeccably shown narrative. This does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythm and variation. However, minor figurative density ("vaulting hush," "drifting prism terrace") and a template cadence in the opening sentence slightly obscure clarity. No major artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is generally polished and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "wisely adventurous" is a label that summarizes rather than dramatizes, and there is a slight template cadence in the description of the murals. These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. Minor scaffold is present in adjacent sentences that restate similar ideas (e.g., "encroaching darkness" variations), and a slight register drift occurs in the final paragraph's more abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong sensory detail ("air shimmered with the soft glow of fungi"). Minor artifacts include the slightly forced compound "shadowseam wonder" and a hint of summary in the transition back to the farm ("Elara returned..."). The closing sentence, however, is a strong, concise crystallization of the theme and character stance.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly controlled, with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythmic variation. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "standing waves of sound" conveys both a scientific concept and a metaphorical state). No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles to detract from clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative overload occurs in the high-pressure beat describing the vines ("swirling like a storm of light"), creating a slight coherence strain, but it does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lucid and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("forgotten promises," "shimmer, as if approving"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure sense. The final line lands with resonant clarity, recharging the motif of dust.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive. A distinct text artifact appears: the phrase "coded freedom" is used twice ("coded freedom etched into its brass surface," "coded freedom broadcast"), creating a slight synonym loop that dulls the potency of the second use. This minor scaffold issue prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, though slightly over-written in places ("whisper of a melody lingering") with a tendency toward synonym churn ("vested hush," "quietly vivid"). Rhythm is controlled, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats, with no artifacts harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, precise language. Information density is high; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A single, minor instance of potential synonym churn ("forgotten tales"/"stories lost to time") prevents a perfect score, though it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. The phrase "uncertainly certain purpose" is a minor figurative muddle, and a slight template cadence appears in "Its glass panes cracked and its once-lush plants withered." However, these artifacts are isolated and do not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "luminous regret" is repeated, creating a slight synonym loop that slightly dulls the potency of its final use, preventing a higher score despite otherwise exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety that supports the atmospheric pressure. There is a minor risk of over-poetic language (e.g., "luminous ache"), but it remains voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity or causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor figurative muddle appears in the final paragraph ("ultraviolet penance" feels slightly forced). Rhythm is strong and sentence-level craft supports the accumulative, sensory-driven narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. However, a cluster of figurative language in the final third ("whispers trading secrets," "danced like ghosts," "eternal instant") creates a slight density that, while beautiful, marginally dulls the clarity and propulsion of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor register drift occurs with the slightly abstract phrase "weightless burden" at a peak moment, but it does not significantly obscure clarity or closure. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, supporting the ethereal tone. A single, minor instance of potential synonym churn ("cryptic letterpress operator" / "ancient machine" / "crystalline spires") is negligible and does not obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, efficient imagery ("shimmering ribbons," "gilded spires"). Information density is excellent. A minor rhythm plateau occurs in the second paragraph with a series of complex sentences, creating a slight deceleration before the plan is revealed.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("a waterfall of stars"). There are no observable loops, scaffold, or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure. Sentence-level propulsion is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally lucid and evocative with high information density. A minor rhythm stumble occurs in the psychometry beat ("Images flashed in her mind..."), where the phrasing leans slightly summary-like, creating a small momentum dip in an otherwise propulsive sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. A minor deduction for a repetitive stem: the phrase "timewoven alliances" appears three times, and the construction "reimagine the world" is used twice, creating a slight template cadence. However, this does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for moments of potential overwriting or slightly mixed metaphor ("winter began to melt, its last snow dissolving into the earth like a sigh" followed by "air was thick with umbral tenderness") which, while beautiful, slightly risks clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery ("shadow stretching like a dark whisper"). Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor -0.3 deduction for a slight scaffold phrase ("its pages heavy with secrets she had yet to unravel") which is quickly overcome by the concrete action that follows. No loops or muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery, though minor template cadence appears (e.g., "She walked...", "She made her way..."). These slight repetitions do not obscure closure but slightly dull momentum in transitional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent; sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No noticeable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single minor deduction for the slightly precious phrase "velvet disquiet," which, while effective, borders on aestheticizing emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in the opening description ("icebound atrium, where starlight filtered...") and a near-paraphrase loop describing the vortex's energy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat: "the air thickening as if time itself were slowing" mixes a tactile sensation with a temporal metaphor, slightly obscuring clarity at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, minor instances of slightly elevated or redundant phrasing ("primal elegance," "eternal canvas") create subtle register drifts that slightly dull the immediacy of peak beats, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. However, minor artifacts deduct: the phrase "astonished recluse" is a tell-y label, and there is a slight template cadence in the description of the ghosts ("not the eerie specters... but figures of mute eloquence"). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the immediacy of their respective beats.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful. Minor artifacts include a slight scaffold feel in the garage sale description ("Vintage clock, ticks...") and a near-paraphrase loop ("time itself had grown uncertain" / "time had found its rhythm again"). These do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple functions (e.g., "the drake's tail feather still in his hand" conveys action, image, and cost). A minor instance of near-synonymy ("burnished hush" following "quiet hush") is a hairline slip but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward slightly elevated diction in peak beats (e.g., "brazen calm unbroken") and a paraphrase loop in the first paragraph describing the diary's dual purpose. These do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "bronze quiet" is a slightly precious, register-drifted metaphor that feels more authorial than character-bound. However, it does not obscure closure or causality, and the rest of the line-level craft is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction for a few instances of slightly dense figurative language that momentarily slow momentum (e.g., "a line so narrow it seemed to hold the vastness of eternity"). However, these do not obscure cause/effect or harm the closure, and there are no loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with good momentum and information density. Minor clichés ("sun bled into the horizon") and a slight over-reliance on visual description prevent a higher score, but there are no major artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles obscuring key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., the compass rose description also reveals character). A minor instance of slightly elevated diction ("temporally stretched expanse") prevents a higher score, but it does not obscure clarity or harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) for a cluster of slightly ornate metaphors in the high-pressure climax (e.g., "captured fragments of the stars themselves," "pulse with a faint, golden light") that, while beautiful, momentarily soften the scene's tactical edge.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. The walking sequence is particularly well-executed, its syntax mirroring the deliberate steps. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph achieves a clean, resonant cadence without summary or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. However, minor overwriting occurs in peak beats with stacked modifiers and abstract nouns ("harmony of her fragmented self"), slightly blurring sense and momentum. A template cadence emerges in consecutive sentences starting with "The" in the climax. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight "thesaurus-itis" in phrases like "fierce repose" and "winnow her soul," which feel slightly elevated for the POV and momentarily stall momentum. However, these do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops or scaffold issues. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("quilts memories together" used twice) and slight synonym churn ("frayed beyond repair" / "dissolved entirely"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and concise with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Minor figurative language in high-pressure beats ("portal to the temporary eternity") is pattern-taught and pays off. A slight paraphrase loop occurs ("temporary eternity" used twice in close succession near the end), costing a small deduction but not obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concisely evocative with high information density and excellent rhythm. A minor template cadence appears ("His task... but his mind"; "He reached... Closing his eyes") and a single filter verb ("he felt") in a peak beat, but these do not measurably obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with good rhythm. Minor artifacts include the slightly abstract phrase "geography of loss" and the convenient, unresolved origin of the phone calls, which slightly dull causality.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythm. A minor instance of repetitive phrasing ("fractured grace") occurs, and the line "involuntarily truthful" has a slight diagnostic feel. However, these are small artifacts that do not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly atmospheric with strong momentum. A single, minor paraphrase loop ("softly persistent" used twice in close succession) and one slightly elevated diction choice ("psychic weight") in a peak beat prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely clear and purposeful with strong atmospheric description. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("peculiar object," "extraordinary," "intrigued") in the discovery beat and the aforementioned "empirically intuitive." These do not significantly harm momentum or clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concise imagery. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple elements. A minor instance of paraphrasing ("disenchanted queen was no longer disenchanted") slightly dulls the final line, but no major artifacts harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight density issue in high-pressure beats, where figurative language stacks ("palette of resolve," "fragment of a forgotten star") creates a mild overlay without a clear pattern-teaching payoff, slightly obscuring immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "jaded wonder" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence that slightly dulls the final image's freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and propulsive, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "piecing together fragments of experience like a puzzle with missing pieces"), which creates a hint of stylistic self-awareness. However, clarity is never obscured, and the closure image lands with force.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "saturated hush of twilight," "time felt elastic") which, while beautiful, occasionally nudges toward ornamentation. However, clarity and momentum are never broken, and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. The read-aloud test passes flawlessly. A minor, near-hairline slip occurs with the phrase "ethereal grit," which feels slightly like a label for the established tone rather than a dramatization of it, preventing a 9.0+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward abstract language ("fractured essence of existence") and a slight over-reliance on figurative description in high-pressure beats, which slightly mutes the clarity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("Elias squinted at the words... He squinted again") and the phrase "fjord quiet" feels slightly contrived. These do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. Figurative language ("quiet wildfire," "scalpel") is effective and coherent. No significant loops, scaffolds, or register drifts were detected. The final paragraph demonstrates excellent rhythmic control and a strong closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold were detected. The language is precise and vivid, with a read-aloud quality that supports the accumulative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly evocative and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor thesaurus-churn is detected in phrases like "melodically haunted relic" and "cultivated estrangement," which feel slightly manufactured compared to the more organic narration. However, this does not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines serving multiple functions. A minor paraphrase loop exists ("preservation" and "regeneration" in close succession), but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor template cadence ("the kind that comes... the kind that lingers") and a slight paraphrase loop ("vastness beyond her struggles"/"world feels too vast") create a small artifact, but they do not obscure closure clarity. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally controlled, dense, and purposeful, with a varied rhythm that supports the accumulative build. Figurative language is cohesive and enhances clarity rather than obscuring it. There are no loops, scaffold, or artifactual phrasing. The final paragraph's cadence provides a perfect, resonant conclusion without summary or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely lucid and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. The minor filter-verb stack in the climax ("Elara realized," "she understood") applies a -0.5 deduction as it slightly obscures the immediacy of the peak beat. Otherwise, sentences are purposeful and advance the narrative with high density.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, minor density issues appear in high-pressure beats, such as the slightly stacked metaphors in "a shadow woven from starlight" and "tapestry of emotion," which slightly dull immediacy without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong, with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a few moments of less-embodied language ("analytically intuitive mind," "tears welled") that briefly abstract the character's experience in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat: "The entangled memories weren’t a curse; they were a bridge..." functions as a moment of explanatory summary that slightly dulls the immediacy of the climactic realization. Otherwise, information density is high and sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. A minor instance of slightly elevated diction ("calculated spontaneity") clashes subtly with the POV's established voice in a high-pressure beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concise imagery. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: the adverb "spiralingly" feels slightly contrived, and the phrase "stillwater tension" is a near-cliché. However, these do not significantly harm momentum or clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and clarity. Minor artifacts include a tendency towards summary ("he worked tirelessly") in pivotal moments and some synonym churn ("quiet contemplation," "subtlety and nuance"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a cleaner, more impactful line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor abstraction in "combative tenderness" slightly dulls the closure image, but no loops or scaffold issues. Rhythm supports emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly controlled, vivid, and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a few instances of slightly abstract or diagnostic language ("emotional void," "morally ambiguous figure") create minor scaffold in an otherwise concrete and embodied narrative, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence openings. However, minor figurative over-density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "lantern-moth hush," "cobalt atrium," "humming quartz" in close succession), applying a slight deduction. The closure image remains clear and unaffected, and the read-aloud rhythm is excellent, but a few phrases verge on decorative rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("shards... like captured rainbows") is pattern-taught and serves closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifice. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and density. A minor prose artifact appears in the climax: the phrase "exhausted but enlightened" is a tell-y summary that slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure beat's earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a template cadence ("crafting jewelry, gazing at the stars, and leaving origami figures") and a mildly contradictory metaphor ("veil of sorrow" is a slight cliché in an otherwise fresh piece).

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, efficient imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "Rain tapped against the skylight like a distant Morse code" establishes mood, setting, and theme). A minor instance of potential register drift exists in the slightly formal phrase "steadily curious," but it's a single, isolated moment that does not harm closure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is dense, bordering on overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "atoms of nostalgia were alive"). This creates minor muddle but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor figurative density in the high-pressure beat ("luminous regret," "shimmering like smoke") creates a slight register drift, though it remains legible. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and controlled with strong rhythmic variation. Minor momentum drag occurs in the reflective block, and a single instance of a paraphrase loop ("layers of naivety, layers of fear, layers of doubt") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slightly mixed metaphor ("roots reaching into her thoughts" following plant whispers) and a trace of elevated diction ("meteor hush") that slightly clashes with the POV's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally polished and purposeful, with strong sensory detail. Minor issues include a slight filter-verb stack ("Elara felt... realized... thought") in the climax and abstract nouns ("a sense of purpose") that slightly dull the closure's tactile impact.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with high information density. Minor instances of near-synonym churn ("shadowed rapture," "beautiful and haunting") and a slightly over-reliant pattern of figurative language prevent a higher score, though clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with effective variation in sentence length and rhythm. A minor instance of potential ornamental language ("fractured lullaby") does not obscure causality or dull the closure. No significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong variation in sentence structure. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("symphony of ideas" slightly abstract) prevents a higher score, but no loops or artifacts harm closure. Information density is high, and momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly evocative and generally precise, with strong rhythmic control. Minor issues include a slight template cadence in phrases like "Twilight draped...", "The air hung heavy...", and a near-paraphrase loop between "the leash had broken" and "the leash was gone." These do not significantly harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. There is a minor instance of potential overwriting in "seraphically mundane," which risks being overly precious, but it is a single phrase and does not create a pattern that harms clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but minor artifacts exist. The phrase "regally unpretentious" is used repeatedly, creating a slight template cadence. A synonym loop occurs with "false light" and "shadow." These do not obscure closure but dull the peak beat's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is elegant and precise with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A minor text artifact exists: the phrase "practice of tapping rhythms" is repeated verbatim from an earlier paragraph, creating a slight paraphrase loop that slightly diminishes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts: "thunderous serenity" is a slightly mixed metaphor, and a few sentences verge on summary ("transform into something steadier"). Overall, clarity and momentum are maintained, especially in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "steam rose like ghosts"). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences like "The script spoke of cycles... The embryo in amber was one such seed," causing a slight paraphrase loop, but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lucid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact is present: the repetition of the "pearl of stillness" concept, first as a metaphor for the photo and then for her internal state, creates a slight thematic echo that borders on prompting. This slightly dulls the otherwise earned resonance of the closure image. No other significant loops or muddles.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "threads of despair," "tapestry") though it remains coherent and voice-motivated. Rhythm is controlled and propulsive, especially in the final ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A slight figurative density appears in the opening paragraph ("world had paused to catch its breath"), but it is pattern-taught and doesn't obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, though a few sentences could be more concise.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and highly effective, with strong momentum. Information density is excellent; sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere. No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. A very high level of line-level craft supports the story's clarity and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lucid, rhythmic, and highly efficient, with strong information density. Figurative language ("tranquil blaze") is purposeful and lands effectively. A single instance of potentially slightly elevated diction ("senselessly perceptive") is the only minor flaw, but it is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information density is excellent, with lines often doing multiple jobs. A minor instance of potentially abstract phrasing ("emotions transliterated") appears in a high-pressure beat but is quickly grounded in action, preventing significant muddle. No loops or scaffolding artifacts were detected.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic variation. However, some figurative language feels slightly forced ("orbits of regret," "whispers of the wind"), and a few sentences are overly complex, creating minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. A minor artifact penalty for a template cadence in the first paragraph ("a constellation tattooist named Elara worked tirelessly... Her hands, steady yet weary, traced...") and a single instance of potential synonym churn ("sanctuary and her prison"). These do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight risk of overwriting in the opening simile ("like a reluctant lover") and the label "lilac unease," though both are quickly grounded in embodiment. The closure beat is clear and propulsive, devoid of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and good rhythmic control. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a subtle paraphrase loop: "renaming the narrative" and "renaming their reality" appear close together with near-identical meaning. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent, advancing story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor overwriting in a few high-pressure beats ("swirling like paint in water") slightly reduces clarity and momentum, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. A slight over-reliance on "fractally" and the compound "willowglass" feels slightly manufactured, but clarity is never obscured, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold is present in adjacent sentences restating the fossil's purpose ("key, not just to the caves but to something greater"). This artifact does not touch the closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, specific imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward abstract phrasing in the peak beat ("a reminder that every moment held the potential for change"), which momentarily dulls the concrete immediacy of the chorus of voices. Otherwise, no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere simultaneously. A single, minor artifact: the phrase "prudently daring" feels slightly summary-like for this high standard, but it is an isolated moment in otherwise flawless line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. There is a minor tendency toward abstract phrasing in key beats (e.g., "distill complexity into essence"), but it is voice-consistent. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph achieves a powerful cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is clean, concise, and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The glass thrummed louder as the community came together"). No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. A single minor filter verb cluster ("she felt a connection," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions (e.g., "quivering hush" establishes atmosphere and foreshadows change). Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats, but clarity and momentum are maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in the opening ("Elena stood... Her boots sinking...") and some synonym churn ("brittle" used three times). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exemplary. The prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive without a single loop or artifact to obscure clarity. Sentences are varied and rhythmic, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A hairline slip prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language ("constellations that seemed to whisper secrets") is purposeful and taught. No loops or scaffold. Rhythm varies effectively with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "danced like specters") and a template cadence in "Its intricate design was more than a tool; it was a map...". However, these do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, with vivid, concise sentences that advance multiple jobs. Rhythm is generally strong, though a slight template cadence appears in two adjacent sentences starting "The quarry...". Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative density without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythm. High information density, with lines often doing multiple jobs. The phrase "spongey dread" is a minor figurative artifact that slightly muddles clarity in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, the language is precise and propulsive, especially in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a tendency towards slightly over-written or abstract phrases ("luminous disbelief," "sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never'") which, while thematically relevant, can momentarily pull the reader out of the concrete moment. The closure image, however, remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and highly efficient, with sentences that advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere simultaneously. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating during the exploration and breathing at the end. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The opening and closing lines are particularly strong, anchoring the voice and resolving with a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, a figurative muddle appears in the high-pressure climax: "words flowing like a river of light" is a slightly mixed metaphor that mildly obscures the clarity of the decisive moment, incurring a deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, serving atmosphere and character. No significant loops, scaffold, or register drift. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract "warlike serenity," which appears in peak beats but is quickly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and propelled, but suffers from minor repetition of phrases like "anxious elation" and "purposefully curious," creating a slight template cadence. These artifacts do not significantly obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats. Sentence-level craft supports the atmospheric tone and emotional weight without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong information density. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a single high-pressure paragraph ("echo valley longing," "ghosts of his past"), which creates a small muddle, and a paraphrase loop ("unmoored"/"adrift"). These do not seriously harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing in emotional peaks (e.g., "haunted ambitions," "purpose") that slightly dulls immediacy. However, information density is high and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally exquisite with high information density and clear propulsion. However, a minor paraphrase loop occurs: "ever-changing and impossible to grasp" restates "river" from the previous sentence without added pressure. This is a small artifact that slightly dulls an otherwise peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence structures and sensory specificity. Minor artifact: "heartbeat of a hesitation" is slightly precious but not disruptive. No loops or scaffold; clarity remains high in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly accomplished with vivid, concrete language and strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "its rusted tracks gleezing under the pale autumn sun" establishes setting, mood, and time). A very minor deduction for a slight register drift in "daringly methodical," which feels slightly authorial.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. No significant loops, scaffold, or artifacts were detected to obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a slightly ornamental phrase ("mulberry ache") and a potential synonym loop in "propagate the truth" / "propagate. protect. prevail." which slightly dulls the closure beat. Information density is otherwise high.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor issues include a few filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") in peak beats and a slight register drift in the traveler's dialogue, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, though it risks overwriting in places (e.g., "vineyard hush," "umbral grotto"). A minor figurative muddle occurs with "eyes like the moon and hair that flowed like the wind," which is a conventional image. The closure beat, however, is clean and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and concise with good rhythm, though a slight over-reliance on figurative language ("navigate the murkiest moral waters") creates minor density in early beats. No significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure cause and effect or the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence rhythms that accelerate during the trance. Figurative language ("patterns in the rings of a pond") is pattern-taught and pays off. A minor scaffold phrase ("carefully woven") repeats but does not obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, though one near-duplicate ("carefully woven") appears.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting (e.g., "the pulse left wandering through the air") and employs a high density of figurative language that, while often beautiful, creates minor drag on momentum and clarity in places, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lucid and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final line ("brilliance dimness") is a potent, resonant image. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and supports the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is consistent and effective ("cradle the world in its palm"). A minor instance of potential synonym churn ("enigmatic pull" / "irresistible" pull) prevents a higher score, but clarity is never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts are present: a synonym loop ("contracted" / "contraction") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "stars whispered secrets in static bursts," "stars whispered their approval"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a template cadence run: "words of loss, of hope, of love." This slight artifice is noticeable but does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong sensory detail. A minor deduction for a slight "template cadence" in adjacent sentences describing the bell's sound and his smile ("The sound was faint... Eliard smiled"), creating a small rhythmic hiccup in an otherwise well-controlled line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor scaffold appears in phrases like "mirrored hush of twilight" and "stars beginning to prick the sky," which, while beautiful, slightly lean toward decorative density in high-pressure beats. No loops or artifacts harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm. Minor scaffold issues: "ancient freshness" is repeated, and "touch of wonder" appears twice. A slight paraphrase loop occurs with "logic and intuition" reiterated. These are minor and do not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and supports pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely clean and purposeful with strong rhythm. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in the second paragraph ("It was more than... It was a reminder...") and a slightly over-written description of the clouds "forming shapes that mirrored the seeker’s thoughts."

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong information density. A minor deduction for the filter-verb cluster noted in Q6 and a slight template cadence in "Fear, anger, sadness, joy—they came in waves." These are minor artifacts that do not significantly obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally polished and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "orthogonal approaches" is used twice and feels slightly jargony for the voice, creating a small register drift in an otherwise seamless narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but a minor pattern of repetitive sentence stems ("Eli began," "Eli moved," "Eli knew") and the slightly abstract phrase "mournfully eager" creates a subtle template cadence, preventing a higher score despite otherwise exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. However, minor artifacts are present, including a template cadence in "Her eyes... scanned... Her breath... was..." and a slightly mixed metaphor in "the homesickness clawed at her." These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score. The final line is a strong, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "shimmering with an otherworldly light," which slightly softens clarity. However, no loops or scaffold artifacts harm momentum, and closure remains crisp and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control; sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats ("the abandoned towers seemed to lean closer, their shadows shifting like whispers"). No loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with vivid imagery. A minor scaffold artifact exists: the phrase "resiliently positive" is used as a label in the first paragraph and later summarized as "resilience unwavering," which slightly dulls immediacy through repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight paraphrase loop ("fever dream architect" repeated) and a cluster of filter verbs in the high-pressure beat with the shadow man ("Elara felt," "she knew," "she weighed").

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight thesaurus-churn ("balancedly curious," "somber marvel") and a template cadence in the description of the towers. These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("faint pulses" / "faint, rhythmic beeps") and the phrase "incidental heroism" which registers a minor label-speak deduction. However, these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery ("corridors choked with silt and secrets"). Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A minor instance of telling ("she felt a strange calm") in the final paragraph prevents a higher score, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A slight over-reliance on simile ("like a forgotten relic," "like galaxies") creates minor figurative clutter in early paragraphs, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely strong with vivid, concrete imagery and good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("filled with a sense of accomplishment" / "spirit unbroken") in the final paragraph and the somewhat soft, diagnostic phrase "a sense of accomplishment" itself at the peak moment. These slightly dull the closure's edge but do not break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but suffers from minor artifacts. The phrase "gravitationally playful" is a label-only trait that lacks embodied demonstration. A slight register drift occurs with "cosmic joke," clashing with the grounded voice.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and sensory detail. A slight momentum dip occurs in the reflective paragraph ("The gap between knowing..."), which, while thematically relevant, mildly slows the causal propulsion toward the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong and evocative, with high information density. A minor artifact penalty (-0.2) for a near-paraphrase loop: "mend fractured skies" and "bridge the divide" in close succession. The phrase "brittle hush" is repeated effectively for closure, not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A minor instance of potential ornamentation exists ("whispering gleam" appears twice), but it is pattern-taught and supports the closure, causing no muddle or momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density ("its shelves groaning under the weight of bound ideas"). Rhythm and syntax accelerate effectively with the library's awakening. A minor artifact appears in the phrase "breathing and alive," which is a near-duplicate, and the "glowing ribbon" metaphor is slightly less sharp than the surrounding text. These are minor and do not obscure closure, but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts appear: synonym churn ("vitalize" used twice, "cipher of longing" echoed) and a slight register drift in phrases like "cipher of longing" and "luminous absence" which, while voice-motivated, border on abstraction in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. A minor instance of potential "therapy-speak" occurs with "her unassuming boldness shining through," which tells a internal state that could be more effectively shown. This is a small artifact in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor clichés ("whispered tales," "breadcrumb," "beacon") and a slight over-reliance on adjectives in places ("damp, earthy air," "crisp" air) prevent a top-tier score. The closure beat remains clear and unscathed by these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and vivid imagery. Minor line-level artifacts include a cluster of filter verbs ("she believed," "she knew") and a slight register drift in the phrase "combative tenderness," which feels slightly abstract for the POV's lexicon. These do not, however, obscure the cause/effect chain or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but exhibits minor overwriting with dense figurative language that occasionally risks blurring sense (e.g., "the color of wonder"). A template cadence emerges in some descriptive sequences, slightly dulling momentum without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density; nearly every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or story. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("sever the threads of time"). A single, minor prose artifact occurs: the phrase "lucid unrest" in the first paragraph edges toward diagnostic label-speak. However, this is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beats, where the language remains concrete and visceral ("the net sagged in her hands... profound stillness").

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor artifact occurs in the climax: the phrase "the air thick with anticipation" is a slight cliché that dulls the immediacy of the excavation beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is strong and supports the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is precise and coherent ("silence was as deep as the ocean"). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected; the read-aloud rhythm is sophisticated and varied.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory propulsion. A minor mixed metaphor ("tinkersong wonder" slightly clashes with the digital/haunting tone) and a template cadence in "Her voice, soft yet haunting..." prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, a patterned artifact exists: the repetitive use of "unfolded" (map, clock's face, diary) creates a minor template cadence. This does not obscure closure but slightly dulls the variety of action descriptions. Otherwise, sentence-level craft is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, specific imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A minor figurative strain exists ("spooled wholeness" is a slightly mixed metaphor), but it does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong information density. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward ornate description in a few spots (e.g., "fractally precise movements") which creates a subtle rhythmic echo, slightly detracting from peak momentum during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., "brass hull gleaming faintly against swirling murmurations"). Minor figurative density in peak beats ("pulse with a life of their own") slightly softens clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("hauntingly bright glow" / "hauntingly bright light") and a slightly elevated register in the vortex sequence ("versions of her from different times"). Information density is high, and momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting and a template cadence in places (e.g., "Their footsteps crunching on the dry earth, the floating arches casting long shadows"). Figurative language is sometimes stacked, slightly blurring sense in high-pressure beats. The closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly deliberate, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "bruised sky," "bruised awe") which, while largely effective, occasionally borders on decorative. No loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues; momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structures. Figurative language ("fractured spine," "wings whirred like broken gears") is precise and legible. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Minor rhythm flatness in mid-paragraph transitions prevents a 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, with excellent rhythm, clarity, and concision. Figurative language ("symphonically attuned," "loosened grief") is well-integrated and purposeful. A single instance of potential synonym churn ("swirled and danced") in the opening line prevents a perfect score, though it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a slight risk of overwriting exists in high-pressure beats (e.g., "pulsating with a rhythm that seemed to echo the clouds below"), introducing a minor figurative muddle. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("tone was sturdy brittle"). Sentence-level rhythm is varied and supports the accumulative build. Read-aloud quality is high, with no artifacts obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely fluid and vivid with strong rhythmic control. A minor artifact: the phrase "under the hush of borrowed starlight" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence. The repetition is likely intentional for lyric resonance, but it slightly dulls the novelty upon recurrence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slightly over-written phrase ("quaking reverie of uncertainty") and a template cadence in "dreamers, the builders, the believers," but these do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for some repetitive phrasing ("latent blaze" appears twice, "forgotten combinations" is repeated) and a slightly over-written moment ("a kaleidoscope of fragmented knowledge"). However, these are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly descriptive but maintains momentum and clarity. Figurative language ("sunlight filtered through the canopy like whispered secrets") is pattern-taught and serves the atmospheric goal. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on the visual sense in some descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and concision. A minor prose artifact appears in the climax with a slightly diagnostic phrase ("surge of clarity"), and a paraphrase loop ("the difficult was not an obstacle but a canvas") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive with high information density. A few minor artifacts exist, including a near-paraphrase loop (“shadowed workshop under the stars”/“shadowed workshop under the stars had become a sanctuary”) and the slightly muddled metaphor of “tuning frequencies.”

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a slight scaffold appears in adjacent sentences describing her journal as both "sanctuary" and a place "to cultivate serenity within motion," creating a minor paraphrase loop. The closure beat remains clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery ("veins of bioluminescent moss," "fruit that shimmered like stars"). Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere. No noticeable loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythm. Minor artifact: a template cadence appears in "Her rapidly adapting mind had already begun... Her rapidly adapting mind began to..." which slightly dulls immediacy at a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a slight strain appears in "the violets of impending mystery." No significant loops or artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful. Minor artifacts include the repetitive use of "canyon hush" and the slightly awkward adverb "avalanchingly." The sentence "The air was heavy with the weight of the canyon hush" is a near-paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor prose artifact occurs in the peak beat: a slight register drift into the slightly elevated "vessel for something greater," which creates a small, momentary stumble in an otherwise perfectly calibrated high-pressure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with strong rhythm and sensory specificity. A minor paraphrase loop occurs ("steadiness" echoed in "adrift") and a template cadence ("Elara adjusted...", "Elara paused...") appears early, but clarity and momentum remain high, especially in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences that advance story and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. A minor deduction for a slight scaffold phrase ("a thing of exquisite craftsmanship that concealed pain") that restates the preceding sentence's concept, creating a small paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a template cadence emerges in a few places (e.g., "Her fingers...", "The bead...", "Elara...") and a slight synonym churn ("quiet," "silence," "hush") occurs, preventing a higher score. These artifacts do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. Sentences effectively advance story and mood. A minor instance of potential register drift ("azure defiance") feels slightly ornamental but is not pervasive enough to significantly harm clarity or momentum, and it is tied to a key story element.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, effectively building atmosphere. However, minor text artifacts prevent a higher score. Phrases like "pulsed with a quiet energy" and "murmur of half-remembered dreams" verge on cliché. A template cadence is detected in adjacent sentences starting with "The air..." in the first paragraph. These minor flaws do not obscure closure but dull the line-level polish.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor scaffold phrase ("it was something else, something he’d been chasing") creates a slight abstraction in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, sentences advance story and character efficiently, with varied rhythm and purposeful detail.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, minor artifacting occurs with slightly over-written phrases ("shadowed elation") and a template cadence in early description ("its beam slicing... like a sword of light"). Clarity remains intact, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Information density is excellent; sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single instance of near-paraphrase ("illuminate" / "illuminate the path") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle are present. A minor instance of elevated diction ("quantified sorrow") feels voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat: "its voice a bound release" introduces a slightly abstract and contradictory metaphor that momentarily obscures clarity at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacting occurs in peak beats with paired near-synonyms ("nestled paradoxes of existence," "beauty in contradiction") and a slightly template cadence in the description of Thaddeus ("His eyes, sharp and knowing..."). This slightly dulls the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deduction for the slightly jargony phrase "heuristically gentle," which creates a small register drift in an otherwise embodied description. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and dense with purpose, advancing character and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly controlled, vivid, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight repetition of the "quartz hush" motif and a register drift in phrases like "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" which, while thematic, edges slightly beyond the POV's likely lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and varied, propulsive syntax. No artifacts, loops, or figurative muddle. A single minor filter verb stack ("seemed to see") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong sensory detail. Minor artifacts include a slight register drift in phrases like "terrestrially cosmic spectacle" and a template cadence in "Its surface was etched... as if alive." These do not significantly harm closure clarity but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. There is no evidence of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The language is vivid and precise without being overwritten, even under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("seeds of truth," "weight of silence"). One minor paraphrase loop exists ("lost conversations" repeated in adjacent sentences during the revelation), but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat (e.g., "a symphony of truth that resonated through the bluff and beyond" feels slightly redundant). However, the language remains purposeful and largely free of artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythm. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("fragmented wholeness" appears twice in quick succession) and a slightly elevated register in the peak beat ("a static that whispered of unresolved fears").

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere. One minor paraphrase loop is identified ("listening, of understanding, of healing"), but it is brief and does not obscure sense or momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, minor overwriting is present, with figurative language appearing in most sentences of high-pressure beats ("whispered secrets," "pulse in time"). A slight paraphrase loop occurs between "liberate the knowledge" and "free it from the clutches of obscurity." These artifacts are minor and do not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm, clarity, and information density. Figurative language ("memories floated like fragments of light") is purposeful and coherent. No significant loops, artifacts, or scaffold obscure the closure. A single minor register drift ("beyond description") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful sensory detail. Minor artifacts include a near-paraphrase loop ("smooth the hush" / "smoothed the hush") and the slightly elevated register of "terrestrially cosmic," which feels slightly outside the POV's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere. A minor artifact is noted: the phrase "patiently nimble" feels slightly label-like for a trait that is otherwise shown effectively through Elias's dialogue and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the phrase "quarantined memories," which leans diagnostic, and a template cadence in "She saw a child laughing, a woman weeping, a man standing alone." These are minor artifacts that do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("stalactites hung like crystalline teeth"). There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final line lands with powerful resonance, recharging earlier motifs without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with high information density. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists ("serpentine nexus under starlight, where the universe hums its secret song" risks decorative stacking), but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure. Momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive without a single discernible loop or artifact. Figurative language ("a place of borrowed starlight") is consistent, taught, and pays off. A near-flawless execution that supports the closure perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythmic control and variation. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple duties. Minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "scintillatingly somber," but the figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Sentence-level rhythm accelerates effectively with the climax. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle. No loops, scaffold, or register drift are present to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied syntax and rhythm. Figurative language is purposeful but slightly dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "cascade of energy" and "gritty whimsy"), causing minor clarity drag without obscuring closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; sentence-level craft supports momentum. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, with selective detail advancing story.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence openings. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs, such as the opening anchoring setting and tone. Minor risks of ornamentation exist, like "lonesome splendor," but clarity is maintained, and no loops or artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. Minor artifact: the phrase "logically emotional" trends toward label-speak and appears twice, creating a slight template cadence. However, this does not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A subtle pattern of abstract noun phrases ("restrained wildness," "patient revolution") in key beats creates minor register drift, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong sensory detail. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like "fortified vulnerability" and "reverberation of the truth was deafening," which lean toward abstraction in key moments, creating small artifacts that slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight figurative overload in the phrase "the calm before realization settled over him like a cloak, a moment of stillness before the storm," which creates a small, repetitive loop.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("yearning algorithm" repeated adjacent lines) and a template cadence in describing the workshop's components, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structures. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Minor register drift in phrases like "sensed absence" is voice-motivated and does not harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact is present: a template cadence emerges in the mirror vision sequences ("This time, the reflection showed..."). This creates a slight repetitive rhythm but does not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines serving multiple functions. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some descriptive passages (e.g., "fold in patience, where the ice seemed to whisper") which, while beautiful, creates moments of minor opacity without fully obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is elegant and controlled with strong rhythmic variety and high information density. A minor instance of near-paraphrase occurs ("mismatched steps" / "dance with the mismatches"), and a slight abstraction ("passionate subtlety") in the final line prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. However, minor artifacts are present, including a slight template cadence in the opening description and a register drift in phrases like "whisperfield calm," which feels overly poetic compared to the more grounded narrative voice elsewhere. These do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with strong rhythmic control. A minor scaffold artifact exists: the phrase "perceptively calm demeanor" is a told label, and "earnest whimsy" feels slightly applied. However, these are isolated and do not muddy peak beats or obscure closure. Information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor instance of potential synonym churn ("suspended hush... time itself had paused") in the opening line prevents a higher score, though it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic variation. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Sentences like "a rusted archway became a doorway to a forgotten childhood" do multiple jobs of advancing character, atmosphere, and theme. Read-aloud rhythm is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on the "luminous ache" phrase and the arguably mixed metaphor of a "leaf falling" being heard in a silent, high-altitude observatory. These are small blemishes that do not obscure causality or dull the potent closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Minor instances of slightly ornamental phrasing ("pulsing stillness") prevent a higher score, but there are no loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, advancing story and character simultaneously. Minimal line-level artifacts; a single instance of potential filter-verb stacking ("Elara felt a faint resonance... Elara felt a surge") is minor and does not obscure clarity or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously without scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and does not muddle clarity in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and varied.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent read-aloud rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A single, minor artifact: the phrase "reflectively vibrant" is a slightly awkward adjective-adverb combination that briefly stalls momentum. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary and supports the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in the opening description ("Moss clung... Sunlight filtered..."). The line-level craft is otherwise clean and supports the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "swirling hush") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("began to write, her words flowing"). These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally polished and vivid with strong rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slightly mixed metaphor ("glow... like liquid gold") and a tendency toward lush description that, while beautiful, occasionally slows momentum in the first half.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is very strong with high information density and purposeful sensory detail. There is a minor instance of potential scaffold in the description of her motivation ("to translate heartbeats into maps") which is stated twice, though it functions as a refrain. The prose is otherwise clean, vivid, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional moments of elevated diction that slightly clash with the POV's practical nature (e.g., "sanctuary," "fleeting beauty of life"). However, these are sparse and do not significantly impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density, though slightly over-reliant on figurative language in places, creating minor density issues. The sentence "Its voice a whalebone reverie, smooth and resonant..." is a mixed metaphor that slightly strains coherence. Momentum remains strong, propelling the reader to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A single minor loop exists in the adjacent descriptions of the loft's "hauntingly practical" arrangement, but it does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly concise and propulsive, with exceptional information density. Sentence-level rhythm is varied and supports the accumulating pressure. A single minor loop exists ("fractured stillness" is used twice in the opening and closing, though the reprise is charged and purposeful). No figurative muddle or register drift in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with strong sensory detail and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and a few near-paraphrase loops (e.g., "new equation for hope" / "patterns in chaos"), but these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with high information density. However, a -0.5 deduction is applied for a prose artifact: the phrase "excruciatingly gentle" is used twice, creating a minor template cadence. Furthermore, the figurative language in the high-pressure beat around the word "bear" ("tugged at her chest like an old wound") is slightly less precise than the surrounding descriptions, creating a minor muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts appear: "serene upheaval" is a slightly contradictory mixed metaphor, and the phrase "thoughtfully clear" is repeated, creating a mild template cadence. These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score. Information density is high, and the final paragraph lands with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacting appears in the climax with a slight register drift ("mind alight with understanding") and a near-paraphrase loop between "coax the final secrets" and "last knot yielded its meaning," slightly dulling the closure image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The prose is concise and propulsive, with every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or story, particularly in the potent closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacting occurs in a high-pressure beat with slightly stacked modifiers ("flickering lantern," "quaking with both fear and reverie") and a near-paraphrase loop ("bitterly sweet reminder," "bitterly sweet truth"), applying a small deduction but not harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts appear, including a template cadence in descriptions ("black sand," "obsidian water") and a slight over-density of figurative language in high-pressure beats, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. However, a tendency toward ornate description creates minor momentum drag in a few places (e.g., "its sidereal patience"). The sentence-level propulsion is strong in key beats, but a handful of mixed metaphors ("liquid starlight") slightly muddle the peak clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lush and generally precise, with high information density. However, minor instances of near-synonym churn ("quiet sigh," "troubling serenity") and occasional abstract phrasing ("weight of generations") create slight drag without materially obscuring closure. The final paragraph's cadence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high. A very slight deduction for a minor paraphrase loop ("thundering calm" appears in the first and last lines without a significant reweighting) and a few filter verbs in a key beat, but clarity and momentum are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor loop exists in the description of the pendulum's function in the second paragraph. The final paragraph's cadence is effective and supports the closure image without obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and varied syntax, though minor overwriting exists (e.g., "velveteen gloom" appears twice). Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A slight register drift in the final paragraph ("piece of humanity") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Minor figurative density in the climax ("cascade of possibility") is pattern-taught and pays off, so no penalty. A single instance of potential scaffold ("The air was crisp...") is negligible and does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and sensory density. A minor deduction for the slightly precious compound phrase "ember alcove in mist," which feels momentarily contrived, though it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor deductions for a tendency toward slightly over-written phrasing in a few lines (e.g., "reverence and finality") and a near-paraphrase loop between "impermanence" and "fleeting." No artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythm. A minor scaffold artifact exists in the synonym loop "agonized over the competing narratives" and "plagued his thoughts." The closure image remains clear, preventing a larger deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful with strong rhythm. Minor artifacting appears in a few high-pressure beats with stacked figurative language ("mausoleum of silence," "living cathedral of sound") that slightly blurs sense, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor register drift occurs with the clinical term "synaptic plasticity," which feels tonally jarring against the otherwise lyrical and embodied narration. This is a small but noticeable artifact in an otherwise clean and evocative line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lucid, precise, and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structure. No noticeable loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's rhythm beautifully cadences the closure. A single instance of "involuntarily truthful" feels slightly tell-y but is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor instance of potential register drift ("inadvertently profound") and a slightly template cadence in the description of collected objects prevent a perfect score, but these do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density (“foxglove-stained glass ampoule”). Minor scaffold in phrases like “incisively kind understanding” feels slightly decorative but does not obscure closure. Rhythm supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("boundless yet confining"). There are no loops, scaffold, or muddled metaphors. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. The final line is a masterful, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and no artifacts. Figurative language ("shimmered like the night sky") enhances without muddling. Momentum is maintained through selective detail, and the closure image lands with clarity. Minor scaffold in "something older, something forgotten" is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive. Minor artifacts include a slight scaffold phrase ("a mixture of hope and fear") and a template cadence ("warm and fragrant"). These do not obscure closure, but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats and the phrase "bleak exhilaration" which feels slightly tell-y at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A -0.6 deduction for minor artifacts: some synonymous phrasing ("whispered secrets"/"voice slithered") and a template cadence in the description of the clasp's flickering image. These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, varied syntax, and a strong rhythmic pulse that supports the story's momentum. While the figurative language is dense, it is coherent, purposeful, and never obscures sense. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that hinder clarity or propulsion, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is highly polished, with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful description. Information density is excellent, advancing character and plot simultaneously. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle were detected. A near-flawless execution at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. No loops or artifacts were found to obscure clarity. A single instance of a potentially mixed metaphor ("pit of lies") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a slightly mixed metaphor ("hushed blaze of anticipation") and a near-paraphrase loop between "dreams were said to drown" and "dreams he’d helped restore." These do not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery ("water lapped at the edges of crumbling stone"). There is a minor instance of potential register drift with "dappled resolve," which feels slightly more poetic than the surrounding narrative voice, creating a small artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. There is a minor instance of potentially ornamental phrasing ("luminous torment") which slightly impacts the score, but it does not create a loop or obscure closure. Sentences are propulsive and dense, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. Read-aloud quality is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor deduction for a cluster of abstract nouns in the peak beat ("spark of unfiltered awakening," "repository of potential") which slightly dull the immediacy of an otherwise embodied and concrete climax.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clear and propulsive, effectively weaving description with action. Minor artifacts include the slightly contradictory oxymoron "brilliant dimness" and a reliance on filter verbs like "he felt" and "he realized," which dull the immediacy of key beats without being pervasive enough to cause major drag.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, the repetition of "sieved hush" (3x) begins to feel slightly templated, acting as a minor textual artifact that dulls the final reprise. No other significant loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor template cadence is detected in the opening sentence's structure ("In the furrowed hush of a..."), and the phrase "untethered two kingdoms" presents a slight lexical illusion, feeling tonally slightly jarring for the voice. These are hairline slips that do not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful with strong rhythm. A minor deduction for the slightly contrived phrase "merrily melancholic," which feels like a thesaurus-driven pairing that disrupts the otherwise natural diction.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences advance multiple jobs (character, atmosphere, plot) without scaffolding. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("shimmered like a forgotten galaxy"). Rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but minor overwriting occurs ("a reluctant metamorphosis she could no longer deny"). A template cadence appears in adjacent sentences starting "Elara’s..." and "Her...", and the phrase "paradoxically steady" is repeated, causing a slight momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. The prose is largely free of artifacts, loops, and scaffold. A minor, hairline slip occurs with the phrase "willingly perplexed," which feels slightly more authorial than embodied, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, the writing is precise and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("The portal opened with a whisper, revealing a world bathed in soft, golden light") which slightly reduces density. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but suffers from template cadence in high-pressure beats (e.g., "Elara felt...", "Elara knew..."). This creates a mild repetitive stem effect that slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure image, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "calmly inventive spirit flared" contains a slight register drift, introducing a abstract label in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, sentence-level craft is strong and supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. The prose advances story and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor figurative density artifact appears in the closure beat: "storm-kissed wonder" is a slightly mixed metaphor that, while beautiful, creates a minor muddle in an otherwise crystal-clear peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A few instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("dignified chaos," "fractured rainbows") and a minor paraphrase loop ("the chaos became dignified, the silence became music") prevent a top-tier score, though clarity is never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. Minor issues include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like a snake shedding skin," "like a forgotten hymn") which, while voice-motivated, creates a mild density effect.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though minor scaffolding exists ("a place where time seemed to pause"). No artifacts obscure closure; figurative language serves the accumulative design. Sentences advance character and atmosphere cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong momentum. However, minor artifacts appear, including a slight template cadence in action descriptions ("Elara paused...", "Elara nodded...") and a register drift in the creature's philosophically weighted dialogue, which slightly dulls the immediacy of the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. However, a few phrases risk slight decorative excess ("rhythmically placid melody," "cerulean glow," "cerulean regret") that, while voice-motivated, edge toward ornamentation in peak beats. The closing paragraphs are masterfully controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion toward closure.

No major figurative muddle, though the density could be trimmed in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.6)
    Clean mechanics and clear sequencing maintain momentum, but there’s repetition and occasional purple phrasing (“lingering luminance” recurs; “brilliance dimness” jars). Several sentences summarize emotional truths rather than dramatize them, flattening the peak. Figurative economy could tighten; information density is adequate but not sharp. The final paragraph lapses into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean, propulsive lines with selective imagery; most sentences do more than one job. A few elevated phrases verge on purple but remain coherent and legible. Minimal scaffolding and no significant loops; rhythm varies appropriately.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sentences are clean and mostly propulsive, yet repetition and mild purple tendencies surface (“deafening and silent,” recurring “ambered,” “static bursts”).

The thesis sentences near the end reduce mystery and add slight scaffolding feel. Still, cadence and sentence variety keep momentum intact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.3)
    Clean mechanics and some strong images, but paraphrase loops and stock scaffolds recur (“not just X but Y,” “more than a tool”). Figurative density sometimes substitutes for turn-level specificity, softening momentum. Redundancies around the buckle memory and burden refrain reduce line-level efficiency. The final third remains clear but not electrically compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and largely concise, with purposeful cadence and minimal scaffolding.

    Lines often do double duty (action + atmosphere), and the closing cadence is clean. A few purple edges (“macerate the stillness,” “household that was the world”) brush ornament, but clarity holds. Repetition reads patterned rather than looped scaffolding. Syntax varies enough to maintain propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, image‑forward, and avoids loops; sentences often carry dual duty (world + emotion). Some high‑register phrasing (“interiorizing exteriors,” “boundaries of light”) veers toward purple but remains legible. Rhythm varies appropriately with pressure, and final lines land with precision. Minor condensation could tighten a couple of explanatory phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean with strong images (“air hung heavy with the scent of ash,” crozier as seed) and good sentence variety. Some lines tilt abstract or repetitive (“stifling destiny,” “creative destruction”), edging toward thematic redundancy. Momentum holds and action is clear; no major scaffolding artifacts. Purple-leaning moments don’t obscure causality but reduce sharpness at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line craft is clean and propulsive, with effective sensory economy and few scaffolds. Some purple tendencies and reiterative phrases (“song of beginnings,” overt aphoristic lines) soften edge and urgency. Figurative density edges high but remains coherent; minimal redundancy. Final lines tell what images already show, blunting impact.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean sentences and clear sequencing keep momentum; information density is decent. Some imagery leans into familiar registers (“liquid gold,” “sparkled like stars”), softening freshness. Repetition is purposeful rather than looped, with minimal scaffolding. Rhythm varies, though diction occasionally trends purple.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean sentences with balanced rhythm; images carry multiple jobs (tone, world, action). Minor redundancy and adjective stacking appear (“moving stillness,” reiterations of patience), slightly slowing momentum. Figurative control holds without mixed metaphors, and closure image is clear. Trimming could heighten pressure and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with strong image economy, though a few phrases verge on purple and repeat (“peripherally focused,” “echoes”). Momentum holds with minimal scaffold, and syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat cadence. Information density is solid without clutter. Minor abstraction in peak beats slightly dulls the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is polished with high information density and generally varied rhythm; images do double duty. Occasional purple flares (“whalebone reverie,” “boundary-lessly”) flirt with over‑ornament but don’t blur sense. Minimal redundancy and good momentum into the final image. Clarity remains intact at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line craft is clear, sensory, and largely economical; sentences often do multiple jobs. A few near‑synonym loops and motif reiterations verge on purple but retain clarity and momentum. Figurative language stays coherent and grounded in the scene. Final lines land by image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, image‑forward, and mostly economical; sentences carry multiple jobs. Occasional conceptual repetition and on‑the‑nose phrasing slightly dull momentum in the final third. Figurative language is coherent and not overstacked. No meaningful scaffolding or clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean and paced, with purposeful sentences doing more than one job; image systems (air/light/sound) are coherent. There’s mild redundancy and thematic labeling in places, and a few generalities where concrete embodiment would intensify impact. No mixed‑metaphor muddle or copy errors. The final cadence is measured but could cut sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are generally precise and musical, with strong image-economy and clean syntax. There’s some purple edging and repetition (e.g., “excruciatingly gentle,” multiple “whispers/hush”), which slightly slows momentum in the middle. The final image is clear and not dulled by figurative muddle. Overall density is good, if occasionally indulgent.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines are clear with smooth rhythm and minimal scaffolding; images (mossed barge name, star mirror) carry weight. Some phrasing trends generalized or duplicate (“a promise of clarity,” “waiting for her to uncover”), and abstraction peeks through. Figurative density is controlled; no muddled metaphors. Momentum holds, if softly.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are mostly clean and sensory‑efficient; images often do double duty (the fulgurite’s veins echoing knots). Some paraphrase and lushness recur (“oceanic hush,” fog’s hush) and the occasional redundancy slightly slows momentum. Syntax varies enough to keep pace, and the final image lands clearly. No major artifacts or mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence rhythm, concrete sensory detail, and purposeful metaphors. Occasional elevated phrasing edges toward lushness but remains clear and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line‑level craft is polished: images do double duty, and sentences carry momentum with minimal scaffolding. A few phrases flirt with purple (“liquid starlight”), but clarity holds and metaphors stay coherent. No paraphrase loops or cadence ruts meaningfully drag pace. The final line reprises core motifs with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished and musical, with effective image systems (bioluminescence, liquid silver). There’s some redundancy and purple tint (“troubling serenity,” “weight of purpose”) and a few paraphrase‑adjacent lines. Momentum holds, but trimming could sharpen escalation. No major artifacts impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is polished with varied cadence and high information density; images do double duty thematically and atmospherically. A few elevated phrasings (“thundering calm,” “weight of centuries”) flirt with purple but serve tone. Minimal redundancy and clean mechanics. Momentum breathes without sag.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is generally tight and melodic, with strong imagery (“sea whispered secrets,” etched constellations). Some telling/scaffold (“He understood then…”) and summarizing of consequential weeks reduce immediacy. Figurative language is frequent but mostly coherent; little paraphrase looping. The final line lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line craft is polished with strong imagery and selective detail, and most sentences carry multiple jobs. Some paraphrase and elevated phrasing (“velveteen gloom,” “uncharted echoes”) repeat conceptually without adding pressure. Minor overwriting and on‑the‑nose summation at the end slightly dull impact. Mechanics are clean and momentum generally holds.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sentences are generally clear and well‑paced; images (mirror lake, beacon spire) recur with intent. Some phrase repetition and safe metaphors (“promise of something yet unwritten,” “weight of possibility”) skirt cliché but don’t obscure sense. Minimal scaffolding and no major loops; momentum holds. Polished but not razor‑cut.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs, and the imagery is largely precise (“hummed softly,” “mist clung to the windows like a veil”). A few ornate coinages (“thistled calm,” “ember alcove in mist”) flirt with purple but stay legible and patterned. No scaffold loops or clarity breaks, and the final cadence lands cleanly. Minor overwriting keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are clean and varied, with solid image density and few mechanistic joints. There’s mild abstraction and a touch of purple in thematic restatements, but not enough to cloud sense. Repetition is minimal; momentum holds through the ritual. The last image is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences are largely clean with varied rhythm, strong nouns, and purposeful imagery. Occasional purple or abstract phrasing (“mausoleum of silence,” repeated “unlearning hatred”) softens immediacy. No major loops or scaffolding; momentum holds. Final image resolves with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean and propulsive, with strong verbs and purposeful images; repetition is minimal. Some figurative choices lean conventional or lush (“hummed with energy,” “glowing orbs”), slightly diluting precision. Information density is good: lines often do more than one job. The final cadence lands clearly without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean syntax, varied sentence rhythm, and efficient line work keep momentum. Figurative language is mostly apt and not overstacked; repeats are minimal. Information density is good, with description doing double duty for mood and function. A few elevated phrases edge toward purple but don’t blur clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and mostly economical, with purposeful imagery and cadence. A few familiar constructions (“as if holding its breath,” “glowed faintly”) and mild repetition of abstractions (“hush,” “sanctify”) soften impact and slow momentum. Information density is good, though some lines restate theme already carried by image. The final paragraph is clean and lands the cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, selective, and mostly economical, with effective images (“tapestry of whispers,” “threaded doubt”). Some abstract reiterations (“purpose,” “nuance,” “power”) and summary soften momentum. No figurative muddle or cadence templates impede clarity. The final image of the empty ampoule is crisp.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line‑level craft is clean, propulsive, and economical; images do more than one job. Minor abstraction and a couple of near‑summary lines slightly soften momentum in the middle. No significant loops, mixed metaphors, or filter stacks. The final line resolves by image and stance without over‑explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished with strong image economy and clean mechanics; sentences often do double duty. There’s occasional purple drift and repetition of light/shine lexicon that could be trimmed for added torque. Momentum holds without scaffold clutter. The final cadence lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.7)
    Lines are clear, rhythmic, and image-forward; phrases like “rosewater dread” and “emerald tint” stand out without clogging sense. Minor summary in the final paragraph flattens momentum slightly. Figurative weave is coherent with minimal purple excess. No notable scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is controlled, image‑driven, and mostly economical, with a few repeat intensifiers (“bleak exhilaration”) that don’t drag momentum. Sentences do multiple jobs and sequence is clear. Figurative language stays coherent and aligned to sea/mechanism motifs. Minor lushness remains under control at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are clean with good momentum; images often do double-duty. Occasional clichés (“weight of fear lifted from her shoulders”) and repeated diction (“lingering luminance”) slightly blunt freshness. Figurative density stays coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors. Syntax varies enough to keep flow without artifact loops.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are generally clean and well‑paced, with strong sensory specificity and a consistent sonic palette. Occasional redundancies and thesis‑style sentences (e.g., “His motivation was clear…”) slightly dull momentum. Figurative language is controlled and not muddled, though it edges toward overt explanation in places. Rhythm accelerates effectively toward the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry multiple loads (worldbuilding, motive, motion) with minimal scaffolding; momentum is maintained through clean syntax. Figurative density is controlled and rarely cloying; no template cadence or synonym loops noticeably hamper clarity. A slight summarizing glide at the end eases tension rather than compounds it, but does not obscure the closure image. Copy is clean and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are clean and rhythmic, and imagery is generally precise (“cracked mirror,” “loose floorboard,” “rusted key”). There is minor abstraction and paraphrase looping around the noble‑lie thesis that slows momentum. Figurative language stays coherent, avoiding mixed metaphors, though a few generalities could be cut for density. The final line lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line‑level craft is clear and rhythmic with selective, purposeful imagery; sentences generally do more than one job. Occasional purple or abstract phrasing (“stoically sensitive,” “hushed blaze”) and a few near‑repetitions slightly soften edge. Momentum holds; no major loops or filter stacks. Final lines land cleanly on image without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sentences carry atmosphere and action with decent velocity; filter and scaffolding are limited. Some adjective stacking and near‑synonym reiteration (“tranquilly perceptive,” “reclaimed stillness,” “dappled resolve”) nudge toward redundancy. The key beats (map alignment, stamp press) are cleanly rendered. Overall momentum is good, if a touch lush for the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line‑level is clean, with controlled lyricism and strong verbs; images carry double duty. A few purple edges (“mist…like a lover’s whisper,” “descended while ascending”) risk over-insistence but don’t obscure sense. No loops or scaffold drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lucid and image‑dense, with strong sensory openings and purposeful reprises. Some abstraction and echoing (“motivation was clear,” “unfiltered awakening,” “intangibly tangible”) add minor purple haze and telliness. Momentum largely holds, with information doing double duty, and syntax varies cleanly. The final lines land cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clear and mostly lean, with a few mild redundancies (“perpetually surprised”) and decorative abstractions (“brilliant dimness”) that don’t impede sense. Information density is adequate and transitions are smooth. Figurative language is restrained, though some phrasing trends generic. Momentum holds across paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is supple and image‑dense with good momentum; lines typically do multiple jobs. Occasional repetition (“sieved hush,” terrace reflections) borders on insistence but remains purposeful. No notable loops or scaffolding; syntax varies to support breath and pressure. Slight purple tilt in places keeps it just under the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished with varied rhythm and mostly efficient beats; key images (mist, drawer pull, waning moon) carry weight. There is occasional purple tilt and thematic reiteration that could be leaner. No major loops or muddled metaphors impede clarity. The final cadence is clean and image‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clean sentences with good sensory density; most lines do more than one job. Some paraphrase/restate tendencies and mild purple notes (“merrily melancholic,” thematic summations) slow momentum. Rhythm varies acceptably, and mechanics are sound. The final image lands cleanly despite occasional abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished, image-forward, and mostly spare where it needs to be; sentences carry multiple jobs with good momentum. Minimal scaffolding and no damaging loops or muddled metaphors. A few lines lean explanatory, but the closure image remains clear and charged. Syntax variety and verb choice keep propulsion steady.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clear and mostly efficient, with evocative imagery in spices and moonlight. There are mild purple patches and stock formulations that slightly flatten intensity, plus a few redundancies. Sentences vary and momentum holds; no major artifacts or loops. The closing cadence is clean if a bit expository.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentence‑level craft is polished with varied cadence and purposeful imagery; most lines do double duty (setting and psyche). A few heightened phrases verge on purple, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. No paraphrase loops or template cadences dull the closure beat. The final image is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is clean and mostly concise, with some elevated phrases and occasional platitudinous turns that dilute force. A few paraphrase-adjacent sentences restate purpose/emotion, slightly slowing momentum. Imagery like “stitching the air” is strong and concrete, anchoring the lyricism. Overall, solid line work with room to cut abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, musical, and generally efficient; images carry multiple jobs without padding. Some reiteration (“whispering hush”) skirts the edge of redundancy but functions as motif more than loop. Figurative language remains coherent and legible at the climax. Momentum is maintained without scaffolding clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.2)
    Lines are clear with steady momentum and some effective images (half‑painted sundial, cascade of light). There’s minor redundancy and a few stock formulations that soften impact, but no major loops or purple overgrowth. Rhythm varies enough to carry the scene. The final image lands but could be sharpened by cutting explanatory scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, image‑rich, and largely efficient; motifs carry double duty (action and meaning). Occasional abstractions and intensifiers at the revelation edge toward summary but don’t stall momentum. Sentence variety and sound are well handled; no significant loops or filter‑verb stacks. The final lines land with a crisp, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is rhythmic and image-rich with generally high information density. There are a few decorative phrases and mild redundancies (“storm-kissed wonder,” “furiously tranquil”) that flirt with purple but don’t obscure sense. Syntax varies and momentum holds through the closure beat; no significant scaffolding or loops. Final sentence lands cleanly without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with a few ornamental stretches that tread close to purple but retain clarity. Figurative choices (prismatic light, fractured rainbows) are coherent and thematically apt. Minimal scaffolding or repetition; momentum holds. The final paragraph over‑states theme, slightly dulling the closure image’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is polished and image‑dense with good sentence variety; most lines do double duty. A few metaphors recur by design and stay coherent; purple edges are generally contained. Minimal scaffold or repetition, solid momentum for a quiet piece. Final image is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clear and textured, with strong image economy and forward motion. Occasional generic locutions (“stir the soul,” “sense of anticipation,” “newfound purpose”) soften edge and freshness. Syntax and paragraph rhythm vary well, and information density is solid. No major artifacts or loops impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clean, generally concise lines with occasional familiar images (“like ink in water,” “like vines on a trellis”). Rhythm is smooth; minimal scaffolding. Figurative density is moderate and legible, though not startling. No loops or mechanical cadence issues; the prose moves efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines are clean and well-paced, with purposeful sensory selection and minimal scaffold. Occasional purple-leaning abstractions appear but don’t obscure action or cause/effect. Information density is solid; images do more than one job (tides as setting and mechanism of release). Variation in sentence rhythm prevents monotony.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and controlled, with a functional rhythm. However, it occasionally relies on abstract or slightly clichéd phrasing ("a key to something greater," "a bridge between the microscopic and the macroscopic"). The final paragraph's construction, beginning with "And in that moment, she understood," is a common scaffolding device that tells the reader the meaning rather than allowing the preceding image to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from overwriting and a lack of concision. Figurative language is dense but often decorative rather than propulsive (e.g., "a quiet melody that seemed to echo her own search for purpose"). The repetition of key phrases like "scorched testament" and "drifting resonance" creates a mild loop that dulls the momentum of an otherwise straightforward plot.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often lyrical, particularly in its descriptions of the setting. However, there are minor weaknesses that prevent a higher score. The direct listing of emotions and their corresponding colors is a moment of telling over showing. The repetition of the phrase "silently expressive" for both Elara and Kael feels like a slight oversight rather than an intentional echo. These small blemishes slightly dull an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, clear, and rich with imagery, particularly in its descriptions of the library. It maintains momentum well and avoids significant artifacts like loops or overwriting. The primary weakness appears in the final paragraph, which shifts from concrete, image-driven prose to more abstract and declarative statements ("a final act of revitalization"), slightly diminishing the power of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clear and graceful but leans on several familiar constructions ("dwindling like the embers of a dying fire"). The repetition of key phrases like "gently persistent" and "amplified quiet" feels slightly programmatic, as if checking boxes. While free of major errors, the line-level craft doesn't achieve the high information density or syntactic variety of truly top-tier prose, sometimes summarizing emotional states instead of embodying them.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the setting. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("spark that refused to extinguish," "haunting her like a ghost") that tempers its freshness. At key emotional moments, the story sometimes defaults to summary ("The memories of her past life no longer weighed on her") rather than using concrete, line-level action and imagery to convey the internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are moments of overwriting and reliance on cliché ("shimmering with an otherworldly glow," "air crackled with energy"). Phrases like "quaking reverie" feel slightly strained. The sentence structure is varied, but a few generic descriptions slightly dull the momentum in what should be high-tension beats.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.2)
    While containing some evocative imagery, the prose is hampered by overwriting and repetitive sentence structures. There is a noticeable template cadence (e.g., "Their steps were deliberate...", "Their chains rattled softly..."), which flattens the rhythm. The final paragraph shifts from showing to telling, summarizing the mission's meaning rather than letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, with a strong rhythmic sense. There are minor instances of abstract overwriting at the climax ("a battered marvel of human experience") that slightly distance the reader from the visceral feeling. However, the line-level craft is otherwise precise, with no loops or artifacts to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery in the opening paragraphs. The score is lowered due to moments of abstract summary ("felt a shift within herself") and the repetition of the specific phrase "luminous disbelief." These minor artifacts slightly blunt the precision of an otherwise polished piece, especially in the final emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it occasionally slips into abstraction and well-worn figurative language (“fire’s kiss,” “cracks were where the light entered”). There is a slight tendency to use scaffolding phrases that tell rather than show emotion (e.g., “felt like a talisman,” “seemed to whisper”). While generally competent, the line-level craft lacks the consistent sharpness and specificity required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean but contains some stock phrasing and redundancies that dull momentum ("the air thick with the scent of rust and old paper," "timeless embrace"). The repetition of the phrase "trembling certainty" feels more like a prose artifact than a deliberate motif. The final paragraphs shift from showing to summarizing the thematic takeaway, weakening the line-level craft at the most crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and precise, memorable descriptions ("crackling like dried leaves," "sculpting the silence"). Sentence structure varies to control rhythm, accelerating and pausing with the narrative's needs. The piece is remarkably clean, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or overwriting that would detract from its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clear and concise, with a good rhythmic quality. The main issue is the tendency to rely on abstract summary during the climax ("a surge of understanding," "everywhere and nowhere at once"). This flattens the story's most important sequence, telling the reader about the change instead of grounding it in specific, visceral sensory detail. Additionally, the repetition of "remarkably composed" feels like a minor oversight rather than a deliberate framing device.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, successfully creating a strong atmosphere. The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative mood. The phrase "ambiguously clear" is repeated three times, which feels slightly heavy-handed. The most significant flaw is the on-the-nose quality of the final lines of dialogue, which reads as a prose artifact designed to summarize meaning rather than create it.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean but leans heavily on abstract nouns and conceptual summaries ("a testament to his patience," "a paradoxical blend of life and decay"). There are instances of overwriting, such as the forced, self-conscious phrase "the tone of the moment was blooming withering." The reliance on telling over showing lowers the information density and dulls the story's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, with no significant grammatical errors or momentum-killing loops. However, it relies on several abstract or slightly clichéd constructions ("icy warmth," "burned brighter than her fear") that flatten the texture. Phrasing like "subdued awakenings" is vague, representing a missed opportunity for concrete, character-specific detail in a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often evocative, the prose is marred by noticeable text artifacts. The repetition of the phrase "water damage creating images" and the use of a template cadence ("It was as if...") in key moments create a rhythmic loop that dulls momentum. These instances of scaffolding prevent the line-level craft from reaching the flawless standard required for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally clear, with a controlled and varied rhythm. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting; the density of figurative language and elevated diction ("liminality," "auroral sorrow") is consistently high, occasionally feeling self-conscious and straining for profundity. While the style is consistent, a touch more restraint would have amplified the power of its key images.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean and grammatically sound, but it frequently relies on abstract conceptual language ("weight of a swallowed truth," "appraise the stories") where concrete imagery would be more powerful. Momentum is sometimes stalled by sentences that summarize internal shifts rather than dramatizing them through action or sensory detail, particularly in the lead-up to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, with a strong rhythmic control. However, the final paragraph contains scaffolding sentences that summarize the thematic takeaway, slightly dulling the impact of the final, excellent line. Phrases like "regenerative silence that soothed even the most troubled minds" also lean toward generic, high-level descriptors. The piece is largely clean, but these moments of slight overwriting prevent it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and lyrical, but it carries a density of sweet, poetic phrasing that at times feels overwrought ("whispers of ancient stories," "hush of dreaming roots," "symphony only she could hear"). This tendency toward abstraction and sentimentality softens the story's impact. While grammatically sound and rhythmically pleasant, the lack of sharper, more concrete language prevents the prose from achieving a truly incisive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with some nice descriptive phrases like "bronze quiet." However, there's a recurring prose artifact in the repeated use of abstract labels to shortcut characterization, most notably "sensitively perceptive." The story also tends to summarize key discoveries ("The diaries revealed," "These scrolls spoke of") rather than dramatizing them, which slows momentum and reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound but suffers from abstraction and conceptual redundancy. Key ideas ("cryptic," "mysterious," "enigma," "secrets") are circled repeatedly without deepening. Pivotal moments are conveyed through abstract summary ("the power to orchestrate events by directing the flow of information") rather than concrete, sensory-driven action. This tendency to tell rather than show flattens the momentum, especially at the story's emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often lyrical and atmospheric, it occasionally slips into abstraction and conceptual boilerplate ("vast and enigmatic space," "cosmic event"). A notable paraphrase loop occurs when describing the "unraveled stillness," slightly dulling the momentum. The language serves the story's ambitious concept but lacks the consistent, line-level precision and concrete imagery that would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, its high figurative density sometimes leads to overwriting, where multiple metaphors are layered in a single paragraph, slightly blurring the focus. There is some conceptual redundancy, particularly in describing the mirrored horizon, which could have been sharpened through greater concision. Overall, the line-level craft is strong but lacks the absolute precision of truly flawless prose.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clean but lacks propulsion and density, often favoring abstract summary over concrete action. Phrases like "The core concept of fractured timelines had haunted her dreams" feel clunky and expository. While free of major errors, the line-level craft does not rise above functional competence, failing to generate momentum or sharpen key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, with a steady rhythm that supports the story's atmosphere. There are no significant technical errors. Some phrases, such as "peel back layers of the soul" or "awakening from a long slumber," lean toward familiar constructions, slightly softening the impact of otherwise strong, specific imagery. The final paragraph's move toward thematic summary is a minor prose-level issue of telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and moves the story forward with clarity. However, it lacks high information density and occasionally resorts to telling instead of showing (e.g., stating his strength is "lateral thinking"). There are minor instances of templated sentence structure ("His fingers brushed," "His brow furrowed") that, while not pervasive, keep the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional level of artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery like "neon lights clashed with the whispers of forgotten eras." The rhythm and sentence structure are well-varied, propelling the narrative forward. There are occasional moments where the language becomes slightly ornate ("aromatic cautious choices"), but these do not significantly impede momentum or clarity. The final paragraph has a slight tendency toward summary but remains grounded in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythm. Its primary weakness is a tendency toward "telling" emotions and concepts through labels rather than showing them through concrete sensory detail or action. Phrases like "a passionate subtlety in his expression" are a form of overwriting that summarizes an effect instead of creating it, slightly dulling the immediacy of key moments, including the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong imagery and a consistent rhythm. Sentences like "a peculiar silence had settled over the land, as if the world itself had grown weary of sound" establish the tone immediately. While mostly excellent, there are a few instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("weaving a tapestry of sound") and the final paragraph contains a line of thematic summary that feels like scaffolding left in the finished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. The piece avoids major artifacts, but a few phrases rely on abstraction ("tapestry of feeling") or slight cliché ("exposure or worse"). There is also some conceptual repetition around the idea of detached empathy, which creates a minor drag on momentum in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clear, clean, and generally well-paced, with some evocative imagery at the start. However, it sometimes relies on abstract emotional labels ("cautious exuberance," "cycles of compassion") rather than more concrete, embodied description. The sentences are grammatically sound but lack the high information density and rhythmic variety of exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. The rhythm is well-paced and sentences are crafted with care. Minor deductions are for occasional phrases that lean toward abstraction ("whispers of a time beyond the murmur of lost languages") and a slight template cadence in one or two spots, which slightly dulls momentum but does not obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often evocative, with good rhythmic control. There are no significant structural artifacts or loops. However, a few moments rely on familiar phrasing ("slipping through her fingers," "humming with a secret") and the final line's metaphor ("a note in the eternal song of time") feels slightly overwrought, preventing the prose from achieving flawless precision.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, ensuring clarity. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable artifacts. The repetition of "dovetail" as a key verb feels slightly forced, and some phrasing tends toward abstraction ("unravel the very fabric of emotion itself"). The momentum is steady but rarely propulsive, lacking the sentence-level variety and information density of exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often evocative and clean, with strong opening and closing images. However, the piece suffers from minor but noticeable conceptual redundancy, especially near the end. Sentences like "It was a story of loss and hope... And in that story, the crawl space dweller saw themselves" paraphrase the same idea, slightly dulling the momentum and impact of the otherwise effective closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is grammatically clean but is hampered by a tendency to tell rather than show, particularly with thematic and psychological states ("Her true motivation...was about transformation"). There are minor instances of overwriting and the use of abstract labels weakens the immediacy of key moments. The final paragraph comes close to summarizing the theme directly, which dulls the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is a notable strength, with evocative language and a controlled rhythm that supports the story's atmosphere of "haggard awe." Sentences are well-crafted with high information density, and the piece is free of distracting loops, scaffolding, or other prose artifacts. The line-level craft is clean, propelling the narrative forward with clarity and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and functional but lacks the concision and momentum of top-tier work. It relies on stock phrases ("gnawing doubt," "surge of purpose") and tends to summarize emotional states. Several sentences are conceptually redundant, restating ideas rather than advancing them, which slightly dulls the story's propulsion, particularly in the final third's reflective summary.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong imagery. However, the momentum is occasionally slowed by cliché ("eyes like storm clouds") or by telling emotional states instead of showing them ("she felt a sense of belonging, of purpose"). The final paragraph functions more as a summary of the thematic resolution than a final, dramatized beat, which lessens the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and generally clear, but it leans on familiar descriptive phrases ("curling around her ankles like a living thing," "breath caught in her throat"). There's a slight tendency toward overwriting and abstraction ("fortress of unspoken truths") that keeps the language from feeling consistently sharp and specific. Momentum is well-maintained, but line-level craft could be more inventive.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean but relies on clichés ("canvas of stars," "hum with life") and generic narrative scaffolding ("in ways she had never imagined"). The story contains several instances of prompt-like language that reads as expository and abstract, particularly the description of the tile's purpose. This over-explaining dulls the momentum and lyricism of otherwise competent prose.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with a good rhythmic sense. However, it relies heavily on abstract nouns and conceptual language ("prismatic escondite," "spatial mutiny," "fabric of existence") where more concrete, sensory detail could have grounded the experience. Some phrases, like "watercolors on wet paper," are effective, but others feel like high-level summaries of immense events, slightly distancing the reader from the on-page action. The piece avoids major artifacts like loops but could benefit from more specific, tangible imagery in its peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and effective for most of the story, but it occasionally dips into slightly overwrought phrasing ("liquefying rigid thinking," "deathly vitality"). The final two paragraphs lose momentum by shifting into a more abstract, summary-like register that explains the resolution rather than letting the final image carry the weight. This lessens the impact of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is often elegant, it occasionally relies on telling over showing, which dulls immediacy. Phrases like "a testament to her studious nature" and "a quality Elara possessed in abundance" are summary labels. Some descriptions during the escalation, such as the air growing "heavy, charged with anticipation," border on cliché, slightly undermining the otherwise specific and vivid world.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in its descriptive passages. However, there are moments of conceptual scaffolding that could be more concretely dramatized, such as "layering their understanding of the world." A minor repetitive sentence structure ("Each fragment was a thread... Each object was a piece...") creates a noticeable pattern that slightly flattens the momentum in that section.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally well-paced, with strong sensory language. The rhythm and sentence structure support the story’s atmospheric goals. A minor flaw is the repetition of the metaphorical phrase "whisper of closing pages," which feels slightly forced. A few other constructions verge on the ornamental, but there are no significant line-level artifacts that impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and generally well-constructed, with some strong opening imagery. However, it frequently defaults to abstract summaries and stock phrases ("ignited the hearts," "fueled the fire," "fabric of their community"). These formulations report on emotion and significance rather than creating it through specific, concrete detail, giving the story the feel of a well-executed summary.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and generally concise, with good momentum. The primary flaw is a tendency toward summary and scaffolding in key moments. Lines like "It was a photograph of endings and beginnings, of loss and preservation" explain the meaning of an image that is already powerful on its own, slightly weakening the impact by not trusting the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative but occasionally tips into overwriting with phrases like "groaning under the weight of destiny." There are minor instances of redundancy, such as the two-part explanation of her motivation ("to restore not just the drone but the trust...to mend the rift..."). While generally clear and propulsive, the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, but it is held back by several instances of overwriting and cliché. Phrases like "hung heavy with worrying tranquility" and "storm of thoughts brewing within her" are stock formulations that dull the otherwise sharp imagery. These slips, while not pervasive, prevent the line-level craft from matching the story's structural and atmospheric strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong sentence-level craft. However, the narrative sometimes leans on abstract summary where concrete embodiment would be stronger (e.g., "a motivation that ran deeper than mere nostalgia"). There are no significant prose artifacts like loops or template cadences, but the tendency to explain or label qualities slightly reduces the overall immediacy and momentum, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose suffers from repetition of key thematic phrases ("gathered hush," "lonesome splendor," "harness the ephemeral," "unsnarl"), which makes it feel mechanical and overwrought. There is a tendency towards abstract summary over concrete, sensory detail, particularly during moments of discovery. This creates a distance from the action and dulls the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and maintains momentum, but it suffers from occasional overwriting and a reliance on abstract summary at the climax. Phrases like "sustained impossibilities" are evocative but vague, and the final line ("And in that truth, he found his freedom") is a platitude that dulls the impact of the stronger physical imagery preceding it. The piece would benefit from greater concision and a commitment to dramatizing its conclusions rather than stating them.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative, but occasionally leans on abstract summary and scaffolding. Phrases like "Her motivation was clear" and "The bead’s resonance was growing stronger" tell the reader what to feel instead of grounding it in concrete sensation. The repetition of "mournful elation" slightly dulls its impact. While much of the language is precise and beautiful, these instances of abstraction momentarily slow the momentum and dilute the otherwise strong atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and a reliance on abstract nouns and stacked adjectives ("hauntingly optimistic aura that seemed to whisper secrets of forgotten eras"). This creates a conceptual density that often obscures concrete action, telling the reader the emotional effect rather than showing the cause. There are also paraphrase loops where concepts are restated with slightly different wording, which slows momentum and dulls the otherwise evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, but it's hampered by occasional overwriting and conceptual loops. Phrases like "veins through forgotten history" feel slightly cliché, and the final paragraphs contain scaffold sentences that summarize the theme rather than letting the image do the work. These artifacts soften the impact of an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, but it relies on several stock phrases ("ethereal glow," "wields a brush," "bathed in the full light of dawn") that dull its impact. At key moments, the writing shifts to abstraction ("a masterpiece of cryptic communication, its words layered with meaning") instead of grounding the discovery in concrete detail. This tendency to summarize significance rather than dramatize it holds the craft back.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative but suffers from occasional overwriting and redundancy. For instance, Lira’s explanation feels like a summary, and the final paragraph states the conclusion rather than letting the image of the completed chart carry the full weight. There's a slight template cadence in some descriptive passages, which keeps the prose from achieving a higher level of propulsion and density.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. Information density is generally high. However, a few phrases like "healing moonlight" are slightly redundant, and the final sentence summarizing the shard as a "testament to the power of evoking the unspoken" feels like a small instance of telling that slightly dulls the resonance of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting. There is a high density of figurative language that sometimes blurs meaning, and noticeable template cadences appear ("The fragment was more than an object... The child’s cast was more than a journal..."). These artifacts, while creating a lyrical rhythm, reduce propulsion and clarity, particularly in a story striving for poignant emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the setting. However, there are minor artifacts that dull its impact. The line "guided by the pensive mirth that now filled her heart" feels like an echo of a prompt, and the final paragraph summarizes the plot's mechanics ("The fresco fragment, the exposed film, and the knowledge network had all been pieces of a puzzle"). These moments of telling and scaffolding detract from the otherwise strong "show, don't tell" execution of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and competent, but it relies on several clichés at peak moments, such as "heart raced," a "whirlwind of confusion," and colors "exploding into life." The phrase "methodically playful" is an awkward construction. These instances of stock phrasing and minor grammatical slips dull the otherwise vivid and inventive concept.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, moving the story forward with clarity. However, it occasionally relies on familiar constructions and clichés to convey tension ("the air thickening with tension," "chaos converging in his chest"). The final paragraph's parallelism ("against the silence, against the fear, against the encroaching darkness") is effective but borders on the overwrought, slightly dulling the sharpness of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, creating a density that can feel performative and occasionally obscures meaning ("reef-shadow joy"). This results in a lack of textural variety and momentum drag. While the language is ambitious, its relentless elevation clashes with the need for precision and clarity, especially in a story aiming for the highest tier of literary quality. The piece would be stronger with more restraint and concision.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it's held back by minor, recurring artifacts. There are instances of scaffold phrasing and summary, such as "It was overwhelming, yet she knew she had to continue," which states an internal reality instead of letting action convey it. While not pervasive, these moments slightly reduce the prose's propulsive power and information density, particularly during pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with a strong opening. However, it relies on several familiar phrases and clichés ("dust motes danced," "tangled threads," "language of her heart") that dull its sharpness. The structured enumeration of her three promises creates a slightly mechanical, list-like rhythm that momentarily stalls the narrative momentum before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=5.1)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting and a reliance on abstract, intangible concepts to carry emotional weight (e.g., "encrypted compassion"). There are instances of cliché ("mind worked like the gears") and conceptual redundancy that slow momentum. The language often strains for profundity, resulting in a lack of concision and a texture that feels labored rather than effortless.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is elegant and generally precise. However, there is a recurring use of thematic keywords like "blooming," "withering," and "balance" that, while thematically coherent, can feel slightly like scaffold language. This repetition slightly dulls the line-level specificity in a few key moments, reading more like a fulfillment of a concept than a purely organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative and clear, with good momentum. However, there are instances of overwriting and reliance on heavily stylized, repeated phrases like "featherly determined" and "fractured hush." These choices, while creating a distinct tone, sometimes feel more decorative than functional and verge on cliché. The sentence structure is varied, but the density of figurative language occasionally feels strained.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is frequently overwritten, relying on abstract nouns and stacked modifiers ("luminous respite from the weight of her solitude") where concrete imagery would be stronger. Several sentences serve to summarize emotional states rather than dramatize them. This tendency towards abstraction and explicit theme-stating dulls the narrative momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, creating a strong atmosphere. Word choice is mostly strong, though terms like "transliterates" feel slightly academic for the piece's tone. Minor instances of clichéd phrasing and a tendency toward gentle abstraction in a few key moments ("tapestry of recollection") hold the line-level craft back from top marks.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and repetition of key conceptual phrases ("orchestrated serendipity," "ordering randomness"). This creates a scaffold-like effect where the story's machinery is too visible. The final paragraphs, in particular, lapse into summary and paraphrase loops, restating the theme instead of letting the final image do the work. This overwriting dulls the impact of an otherwise strong climax.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates strong command of rhythm and imagery, with high information density in most lines. There is a recurring tendency toward overwriting, with phrases like "rare moonstone cabochon dust speck" and stacked figurative language slightly impeding momentum in the opening paragraph. The craft is undeniably strong but could benefit from more concision in its descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, with a controlled, deliberate rhythm. The primary weakness is a tendency toward abstraction and declarative statements over concrete, sensory action, which can slow momentum. There are also moments of redundancy, such as stating Elias's purpose and then immediately having him think it in similar terms, which could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, momentum is occasionally stalled by sentences that summarize emotional states rather than rendering them ("he began to enlighten himself, not with answers, but with acceptance"). Some phrases lean towards overwriting or cliché ("bathed the ridge in a soft silver glow"), and the final "hard softness" is a slightly strained oxymoron that dulls the otherwise sharp closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, it occasionally leans into abstract conceptual language ("wove intricate theories from the threads of reality," "serene upheaval of her own making") that borders on overwriting. While the phrasing is beautiful, a greater reliance on concrete sensory detail over abstract declaration in key moments would have provided stronger grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the passage. However, momentum is slightly dulled at key moments by a shift towards telling ("She understood then") and the use of a stock phrase ("Her heart raced"). While the overall craft is strong, these minor instances of summary over dramatization in the climactic beats prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, but it carries a high density of figurative language that sometimes borders on overwriting. Minor artifacts are present, such as the repeated label "perceptively calm" and a few scaffolding sentences that explain rather than dramatize ("The lullabies were not just songs; they were stories..."). These slips slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution but do not obscure the story's momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clear but weakened by repetitive sentence structures and scaffolding. The parallel constructions "It was more than a tool; it was a symbol..." and "The terrace was not just a vantage point; it was a sacred space..." create a template-like cadence. This, combined with a reliance on abstract nouns ("ritual significance," "flawed beauty"), makes the prose feel slightly overwrought and less immediate, dulling the momentum in key descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density. However, there is a minor but noticeable paraphrase loop regarding her motivation, which is stated in paragraph two, again in three ("the cost...haunted her"), and then summarized explicitly in paragraph five ("Her motivation was clear..."). This slight redundancy momentarily stalls the otherwise excellent forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong opening and closing images. However, there is a tendency toward abstraction over concrete embodiment, such as "reckoning with the cost of defiance" and movements being a "conduit for the echoes." Some sentence structures follow a repetitive "She [verb]..." pattern, creating a slight template cadence that momentarily lessens the prose's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it leans on abstract, poetic concepts that are repeated without gaining much specificity ("meteor hush," "half-lit epiphanies"). Some phrases, like the dome as a "silent sentinel," are clichés. While the rhythm is varied, the reliance on high-concept labels over concrete sensory detail occasionally makes the prose feel like a scaffold for ideas rather than a lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong, consistent rhythm. However, there are minor repetitive sentence structures, particularly the "Her hands moved..." template, which appears three times and slightly dulls the momentum. Some figurative language, like "a fragment of a forgotten dream," verges on cliché for a top-tier publication. A phrase like "blushing stillness" is effective but its repetition slightly lessens its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("shimmering veil," "whispered secrets") that verges on cliché. The final two paragraphs contain sentences that summarize and explain the thematic meaning ("The forgotten names were not just echoes of the past; they were bridges to the future..."), a lapse into telling that undermines the story’s momentum right at the closure. These moments of telling and slight overwriting keep the otherwise strong prose from achieving exceptional clarity and density.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is ambitious but hampered by a tendency toward abstraction and telling over showing. Phrases like "a testament to the intricate balance between order and chaos" summarize concepts rather than dramatizing them. There are minor redundancies, such as the repeated use of "precisely playful," and sentence structures that become predictable, slightly dulling the narrative's propulsion at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and reliance on abstract nouns over concrete imagery. Key phrases ("schematic representations," "encrypted devotion," "dusky harmony") are looped, creating a scaffold-like structure. Sentences often state concepts rather than dramatizing actions, leading to low information density and sluggish momentum. For example, "Kael's motivation... stemmed from a deep-seated belief" is pure summary where a dramatized moment was needed.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clear and grammatically sound, maintaining momentum without significant clutter. However, it often relies on emotional labels ("his resentment palpable," "his defenses rising") instead of embodying the characters' states through more specific action or perception. The writing is competent and functional but lacks the line-level propulsion and information density of exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but occasionally leans on familiar lyrical phrasing ("ethereal beauty," "swirling patterns of light"). The final line's reprise of "glass mountains" feels slightly forced, connecting a tonal metaphor to a literal thematic statement in a way that risks feeling self-conscious. While mostly very strong, these minor instances of overwriting prevent the prose from reaching a flawless standard.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often beautiful, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. There are no significant errors. The primary weakness is a tendency toward slight abstraction and scaffolding phrases ("a testament to nature’s reclaiming," "a talisman of hope and regret") that summarize emotion or meaning rather than fully embodying it. These moments slightly reduce the prose's density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound but lacks momentum and information density. It suffers from a tendency to state and then restate concepts, as with the recurring phrases "simply complicated" and "nonlinear inheritance." Sentences often summarize internal states ("her bewilderment giving way to a strange clarity") instead of using concrete images and actions to show them, resulting in a narrative that feels told and slightly sluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean but leans heavily on telling over showing, especially during crucial plot points like bypassing traps or the climactic negotiation. There are several instances of scaffolding ("Her method was simple yet intricate") and a tendency towards summary that robs key moments of their immediacy and impact. The line-level craft is functional but lacks the propulsion and density of exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is evocative and generally clear, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, it occasionally leans on dense, abstract noun phrases ("unkindled solace," "trapped freedom," "forgotten dreams") that state a condition rather than dramatizing it through concrete action or imagery. This creates moments where the texture feels slightly overwritten and less immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is burdened by conceptual redundancy and telling over showing. Sentences frequently paraphrase each other ("translate confusion into clarity, to piece together fragments..."). Crucial moments of realization and tonal shifts are announced with abstract labels ("clear complexity giving way to a sense of revelation") rather than demonstrated through concrete detail. The final paragraph, in particular, is laden with summary and scaffolding that drains momentum from the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from some scaffolding and redundancy. Phrases like "Lira’s motivation was clear" and "Lira knew what she had to do" tell the reader what the dramatization should be showing. There are minor paraphrase loops and a reliance on adjectival phrases ("gently luminous glow," "faintly luminous glow") that slightly dull the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is largely clear and controlled, but the final two paragraphs suffer from significant scaffolding and summary. Phrases like "It was a confirmation, a proof that her efforts were not in vain" and "And she, the beacon-tower custodian, had proven it" tell the reader the outcome instead of letting the scene's imagery do the work, which dulls the momentum at the story's most critical point.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong, evocative phrases. However, it is held back by minor but noticeable artifacts. Scaffolding phrases like "Her motivation was clear" and the slightly clichéd image of thoughts "echoing like a question in an empty hall" dull the otherwise sharp execution. The repetition of "deepening hush" feels overly deliberate, bordering on mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often elegant. However, a few phrases rely on abstraction or slightly redundant metaphors, such as "to filter the darkness, to sift through the gloom." This prevents the line-level craft from feeling flawless. The piece avoids major artifacts but could achieve higher information density by grounding these abstract concepts in more concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, with a pleasing rhythm. However, it relies on a few recurring abstract concepts ("tapestry," "texture of time") that verge on becoming boilerplate through repetition. While the language is polished, it lacks the line-level density and surprise that would elevate it to an exceptional tier, occasionally feeling more descriptive than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often effective, but suffers from clarity issues due to overwriting. The use of "xenial" is distracting, and phrases like "intangibly tangible" read as self-contradictory placeholders rather than precise descriptions. These artifacts, particularly the confusing syntax of "her tone stretching contracted," create momentary friction and prevent the prose from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally elegant but marred by occasional awkward or overly technical phrasing, such as the gondola drifting "fluidly logical" or the vial beginning to "catalyze a change." The final paragraph contains scaffold phrasing ("His work was not just about...; it was about...") that summarizes action rather than dramatizing it, slightly dulling the momentum at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and generally well-constructed, avoiding major grammatical errors. However, it relies on some familiar fantasy descriptors ("otherworldly light," "weight of history") and summarizes key emotional moments, such as the ending ("she felt a sense of fulfillment"). The use of "sally" is imprecise and awkward in context. While the writing is clear, it lacks the line-level propulsion and information density of exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, but it occasionally relies on abstract, over-written phrases that distance the reader, such as "The loaded emptiness of the aftermath settled over her." This tendency to label an emotional state rather than rendering it through concrete perception is a recurring artifact that slightly weakens the otherwise strong line-level execution, particularly in the story's denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and generally propulsive, but the final paragraph shifts from concrete action to abstract summary. This move stalls the story's momentum at the crucial moment of closure, telling the reader about Elara's newfound hope and purpose instead of grounding it in a final, resonant image. The piece avoids major artifacts but loses energy at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and generally evocative, successfully establishing the story's mood. However, it occasionally relies on familiar, somewhat overwrought phrases like "scent of aged paper and forgotten dreams" and "spines whispered secrets." While free of overt errors, the line-level craft lacks the precision and high information density required for the highest echelon, sometimes favoring atmospheric telling over sharp, concrete showing.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lyrical and generally precise, with strong rhythm and momentum. A single phrase, "glowed with a factually mystical light," stands out as an awkward, telling construction that momentarily breaks the immersive quality. While the overall craft is high, this minor but noticeable flaw in a key description prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and clear, but it occasionally relies on stock phrases ("forgotten promises," "untold stories"). The final paragraph contains a minor paraphrase loop, restating Elara's newfound purpose in slightly different ways, which slightly dulls the momentum of the closure. The line "the dust on the shelves seemed to shimmer, as if approving of her efforts" is a touch sentimental, bordering on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally functional but is hampered by occasional overwriting and clichés. The opening is lush but borders on purple prose ("auric lagoon," "hues of emerald and gold"), and the ending relies on a tired formulation: "The tyranny of indifference would not stand, not while Mara drew breath." These moments of elevated but imprecise language dilute the momentum of an otherwise pacy narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from overwriting and repetition that dulls its momentum. There are several paraphrase loops ("His motivation was clear... his motivation clear") and reliance on similar phrasing ("whisper," "negative space") that reads as an artifact rather than intentional patterning. The figurative language, while often beautiful, sometimes stacks up ("clung...like a forgotten memory," "lingering like a ghost"), slightly diminishing the clarity of peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is elegant and often evocative, with strong sentence-level craft. However, a few moments dip into cliché ("igniting a fire within her") or slightly overwrought description ("moonstone cabochon dust speck"). The final paragraph suffers from a paraphrase loop, restating the transformation in abstract terms ("blossomed into something greater") immediately after describing it, which dulls the impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often evocative, particularly in its descriptions of setting. However, the momentum is dulled by moments of cliché ("labyrinth of gears," "relentless pursuit of perfection"). The primary flaw is the final paragraph’s reliance on abstract summary, which reads like scaffolding and dilutes the power of the preceding imagery by explaining what should have been left to resonate.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean and evocative, with a strong rhythmic control that supports the story's atmosphere. However, at key moments of insight, the language shifts from showing to telling, using filter verbs and summary statements ("Elara realized," "She understood now"). This flattens the immediacy of the epiphany, making the prose do the work that the preceding scene had already earned.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and generally concise, with strong imagery like the confession taking shape as a memory. However, there are minor repetitive artifacts, such as the reuse of "luminous ache," that slightly dull its impact. The final two paragraphs lean more towards summarizing the meaning and outcome ("It was a reminder of...", "she had pursued... and found...") rather than letting the final image of the aligned harp carry the full weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and maintains a strong rhythm. However, it occasionally leans on abstract concepts ("mathematics of mercy," "symphony of ultraviolet penance") where more concrete imagery could be stronger. The use of a filter verb in the key moment of insight ("Mercy, she realized...") slightly dulls the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, but it is hampered by repetitive phrasing that feels like a textual artifact. Key words like "anchor," "unfasten," "elusively tangible," and "eternal instant" are recycled to a degree that they lose their power and feel like mandated inclusions. This looping reduces the prose's overall momentum and undercuts the specificity of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates good momentum, with varied sentence structure and precise word choice. The story avoids overwriting, maintaining a focused, uncluttered feel. There are minor instances of summary over scene, such as describing the ghosts' reaction as a "chorus of relief and gratitude," which could have been rendered with a more specific, resonant image to strengthen the emotional impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates strong craft with good rhythm and information density. Sentences like "its brass gears humming softly as she crafted words that seemed to shimmer in the air" are excellent. However, a few minor flaws, such as the stock phrase "painted the clouds in hues of pink and gold" and the slightly repetitive sentence stems in the concluding paragraph, prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.1)
    The line-level prose is often elegant, but the overall craft suffers from a critical momentum problem rooted in structure. By summarizing the entire conflict and backstory upfront, the narrative spends its energy on scaffolding rather than propulsion. The single paragraph of present-tense action cannot overcome the inertia of the preceding exposition dump.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and imagistic, but it occasionally slips into overwriting. Figurative language can be strained, as in "its gears wilting near dishonesty," an image that is striking but conceptually muddled. While mostly clear and propulsive, some phrases feel like artifacts of a prompt ("tinkersong wonder") rather than organic descriptions, and the final paragraph's shift into direct thematic summary sacrifices craft for explication.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is hampered by a handful of clichés that appear in pivotal moments ("casting long shadows," "silent sentinels," "a silence that spoke louder than any words"). These moments of reliance on familiar phrasing dull the impact of an otherwise carefully crafted narrative. While the sentence-level propulsion is generally strong, these artifacts prevent the piece from feeling entirely sharp and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean and contains evocative imagery, particularly in its descriptions of the setting. However, it is marred by repetitive thematic phrases (“timewoven alliances,” “layered meanings”) that function as text loops, dulling momentum and feeling like scaffold. Sentences such as “It was as if the slide was alive, communicating with her through layered meanings” state what should be shown, weakening the line-level craft by prioritizing telling over dramatization in key moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, it occasionally leans on abstract emotional nouns and repeated key phrases that function as a kind of thematic shorthand, bordering on a template cadence. While often beautiful, the line-level craft could achieve a higher information density by replacing some of these recurring abstract labels with more concrete, in-the-moment sensory details and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of abstract figurative language ("dark whisper," "layers of time and silence") that dulls the story's immediacy. Several sentences state emotional or conceptual summaries rather than grounding the reader in concrete action or sensation. This tendency towards abstraction creates a slight drag on momentum, particularly in the reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound. Its main weakness is a reliance on summary and abstraction over concrete, moment-to-moment action. Several sentences paraphrase the preceding one, creating minor loops that slow momentum (e.g., "That was not revival; that was a lie. Revival meant creation, not replication."). The result is prose that explains the story effectively but lacks the propulsion and information density of top-tier craft.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and grammatically sound, effectively carrying the narrative without distraction. Its primary limitation is a lack of sentence-level dynamism and a reliance on some common phrasing ("heart quickened," "golden light"). A somewhat formulaic "She did X, then she did Y" structure in the middle section flattens the momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and clear, creating some strong images. However, it occasionally leans on summary and abstraction where concrete action would be more powerful, such as in the moment of understanding ("she understood the method...was not just about reversing decay but about restoring balance"). This tendency to explain the epiphany rather than dramatize its dawning through sensory detail or action keeps the line-level craft from feeling truly propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but is marred by repetition and a reliance on abstract labels over concrete imagery in key moments. Phrases like "credibly curious" and the core motivation are restated rather than dramatized. The climax contains conceptual summaries ("a gentle reminder of the balance between chaos and calm") that tell the reader the meaning instead of letting the image do the work, dulling the story's final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean grammatically but suffers from consistent overwriting and a reliance on abstract, elevated language ("primal elegance," "infinite void," "eternal canvas"). This creates a sense of poetic distance that often tells rather than shows, particularly in summarizing emotional shifts. Several sentences, especially near the end, function as thematic restatements or summaries that weaken the impact of the final images by explaining their meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but leans towards overwriting and abstraction, particularly in moments of emotional or psychological insight. Phrases like "a quiet symphony of solitude" and "felt an inexplicable pull" tell the reader what to feel instead of showing it through concrete action or perception. Several key moments of realization are summarized ("Elias realized the depth of his mission"), which flattens the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean and readable but lacks the precision and density expected at a high level. It occasionally relies on familiar phrases ("relic of a bygone era," "air crackled with energy") that flatten the texture. Sentences are grammatically sound but often follow predictable structures, missing opportunities for rhythmic variety that could heighten tension or atmosphere. There are no major artifacts, but the line-level craft is serviceable rather than exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong imagery and a consistent rhythm. Lines like "The cobalt lagoon after rain shimmered like a mirror" are evocative and clear. However, the piece occasionally tips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can feel precious ("weave words into dawns"). There is some minor repetitive phrasing around the concept of quietness ("quiet shoreline poet," "burnished hush," "stillness"), which slightly dulls the otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and competent but leans heavily on conceptual summary ("a living testament to the harmony between nature and design"). Several sentences state themes or internal states rather than dramatizing them through concrete action or perception. The final paragraph contains a slightly clichéd personification ("The orchard whispered its gratitude"), which softens the impact of an otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, certain key phrases ("luminous skeptic," "artificial pilgrimage," "chemistry of homecoming") feel like transplanted prompt language, creating a slight artificiality in the texture. The final paragraphs shift from showing to telling, a prose choice that dulls the momentum and impact of the climactic image by explaining its meaning directly to the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density. However, the final paragraphs contain several paraphrase loops that restate the theme ("fertilizing the earth... fertilizing the soul," "not grand gestures but quiet persistence"). This repetition dulls the momentum and impact of the closing images, functioning as an unnecessary scaffold for a theme that was already clear.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it falters at the climax by summarizing the crucial revelation instead of rendering it in concrete, sensory detail. This strategic telling weakens the story's core beat. There are also moments of cliché ("embers catching flame") that slightly dull an otherwise competent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and generally clear, but it's hampered by a tendency toward abstraction and scaffolding. Sentences like "It was a vision both beautiful and terrifying, for it revealed the fragility of existence and the inevitability of change" contain paraphrase loops that slow momentum. The writing effectively establishes atmosphere but could be more concise and concrete, particularly in moments of reflection that summarize instead of dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and generally propulsive, but it relies on some stock phrases and abstractions ("stirred something deep within him," "unyielding determination"). The final paragraph is a cascade of summary and telling ("He had embraced the unknown... and in doing so, had rediscovered the wonder"), which replaces the momentum of the scene with didactic reflection. This scaffolding at the story's most critical point dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, controlled, and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm. Its primary weakness is a reliance on abstract, conceptual jargon that sometimes feels imposed rather than emerging from the scene. Phrases like "nomadic penumbra" are introduced as labels, and the explanation "for she too had lived in that shadow" is a slight scaffold that tells the reader how to interpret the symbol, momentarily slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from minor scaffolding and redundancy. The final two paragraphs, in particular, engage in summary that restates what the previous scene has already shown ("The labyrinthine bookstore, the lost language stone, the texture of a feather—all had been tools..."). This, combined with some clichéd phrasing ("gift—or curse," "sharp, too raw"), creates momentum drag at the crucial point of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, several moments rely on summary and abstraction where concrete embodiment is needed, such as "The labyrinth had winnowed her soul, stripping away the layers of self-blame." There are also minor instances of overwriting and cliché that, while not pervasive, slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains striking images like "forged hush" and "skeletal fingers," but it is also hampered by moments of overwriting and reliance on stock phrases ("heart pounding," "swirled faster now," "enveloping her in its glow"). While generally clear, the momentum is occasionally slowed by abstract descriptions where concrete sensory details would have been more powerful. The line-level craft is competent but not consistently sharp or innovative.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose contains strong sensory details but is hampered by significant artifacts. The phrase "quilts memories together" is used as an ungrammatical verb ("to quilts," "she had not just quilts"), a distracting error. There is also conceptual redundancy, with phrases like "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" repeated. These issues, particularly the grammatical mistake, create friction and detract from the story's momentum and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and generally well-paced, but it occasionally dips into overwriting and cliché ("waves whispered secrets," "stalactites hung like chandeliers"). While evocative, these images are well-worn and reduce the prose's freshness. There is a slight tendency toward abstract nouns and conceptual phrases which, while fitting the theme, sometimes lack the concrete immediacy needed to ground the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and generally clear, but it occasionally relies on abstract concepts like "vibrations of intent" and "intentions purified by stillness" instead of concrete imagery. There is some minor conceptual redundancy, particularly in the final paragraph which summarizes themes already present. The line "as though it held a secret waiting to be unlocked" is a cliché that dulls an important moment.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often lyrical, but it is held back by a few minor issues. The repetition of "raw solace" is a small loop, and some phrases like "begun to bear fruit" lean on cliché. While the overall craft is strong, these small imperfections and a slightly too-declarative final paragraph prevent it from reaching the highest tier of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely free of artifacts. Sentences like "The hanging orchard in the ravine was a place of fractured grace" establish tone and setting with impressive economy. There is a slight shift towards summary and abstraction in the final two paragraphs ("The relic was gone, but its lesson remained..."), which dulls the immediacy of the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with sentences often advancing character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. Word choice is precise and the rhythm is controlled, creating a momentum that feels deliberate and hypnotic. While a few phrases verge on the familiar (e.g., "the world itself was holding its breath"), the overall execution is clean, professional, and free of any loops or artifacts that would detract from the story's clarity or impact.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it lacks momentum and density, particularly in pivotal moments. Key developments are often summarized rather than shown (e.g., "The figure explained that..."), and the time compression in the second half sacrifices immediacy. While functional, the line-level craft does not demonstrate the propulsion or precision expected for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from noticeable repetition and overwriting. Several key phrases ("shared exhale," "fireflies of summer," "lacy menace") are repeated verbatim in a very short text, which dulls their impact and feels artificial. This pattern of prose artifacts, particularly the near-identical phrasing of the starlight's nature, disrupts momentum and reveals the scaffolding of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, it suffers from a high density of abstract neologisms ("palette of resolve," "density of presence," "directed spontaneity"). While these coinages support the voice, their clustering can feel like a form of overwriting, stating a complex feeling with a label rather than rendering the experience through more grounded sensory detail. This reduces the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise ("feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder"). However, it occasionally slips into cliché, most notably with "struck her like a lightning bolt," which disrupts the otherwise unique texture of the narrative at a key moment. While generally strong, these moments of stock phrasing prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, especially in the opening. However, the momentum is periodically slowed by abstract, conceptual language ("emotional terrain," "occluded views," "humanize the overlooked") where concrete sensory details would be stronger. The final paragraph contains several paraphrase-loops that restate the theme without adding new pressure or insight.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often elegant, with a strong rhythmic control that supports the story's contemplative pace. There are no significant artifacts like loops or template cadence. The writing is highly competent but relies on some familiar phrasing ("saturated hush," "obsidian surface," "curled upward") that stops it short of being truly surprising or exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. There are, however, minor instances of familiar phrasing ("lingered like smoke," "fraying threads") that slightly soften the otherwise sharp and specific imagery. These moments are infrequent but prevent the line-level craft from achieving true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically proficient, but it leans heavily on abstract nouns and conceptual summary ("weight of centuries," "fabric of time," "coils of understanding"). This high level of abstraction keeps the reader at a distance, telling them about the journey's significance rather than immersing them in it. There are several instances of scaffolding, where the function of an element is explained directly (e.g., "a bridge between languages," "a key to understanding"), which flattens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and competent, but it relies on some familiar phrasing ("relentless march of time," "heart pounded," "endless possibility") that flattens its impact. There is a tendency to tell the emotional and intellectual stakes rather than showing them through embodied action, particularly in the final paragraphs. The sentence structure is solid but lacks the propulsion needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often evocative and atmospheric, with strong sensory details in the description of the farm. However, it occasionally slips into cliché ("storm of questions in her mind") or overwriting ("quiet wildfire burning in her heart"). Sentences like "Elara’s spatially gifted mind began to piece together the implications" are telling and abstract, momentarily pulling back from the otherwise immersive scene-work.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong sentence-level propulsion. However, it is marred by occasional instances of overwriting and cliché. Phrases like "clover melancholy" feel self-consciously literary, and the simile "words flowing like a river breaking through a dam" is a well-worn cliché that dulls the impact of a pivotal moment. These slips, while not pervasive, detract from an otherwise polished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is evocative and clean, with strong imagery and rhythm, particularly in the opening. A minor register drift occurs in the paragraph that explains the story’s theme, where the language becomes more abstract and less grounded in Eli’s immediate experience, momentarily slowing the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clean but is weakened by a tendency to tell rather than show, using abstract summaries of actions and feelings ("Her investigation led her..."). There are instances of overwriting and redundancy (e.g., "gently thorough" is used twice). While the sentence-level mechanics are sound, the momentum is often stalled by this abstracting, declarative mode instead of being driven by concrete, in-scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but leans heavily on abstraction and diagnostic labels ("fragility of human connection," "depth of longing") to convey emotional states. There are instances of scaffold-like phrasing that slow momentum. The final sentence's introduction of "polite anarchy" feels unearned by the preceding text, creating a tonal mismatch at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is elegant and controlled through the rising action, but the final three paragraphs devolve into summary and abstraction. Lines like "Elara’s story became legend, a tale of..." and listing the core elements as "threads in the tapestry of her life" abandon the immediacy of the scene. This shift from showing to telling flattens the conclusion, reading more like an epilogue than an integrated, resonant final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clear and grammatically sound, with a steady rhythm. However, it relies on some familiar figurative language ("crumpled sheet of paper," "kaleidoscope of possibility") and the final paragraph tends toward summary. The piece avoids major line-level artifacts but could achieve greater density and propulsion by converting some of its closing abstractions into more concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled, rhythmic cadence. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes feels more decorative than functional ("a shadow woven from starlight"). There are also minor paraphrase loops, such as stating she was forgotten and then immediately adding she stood alone, which slightly dilute the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is clear but suffers from a template cadence, particularly with sentences starting "The arsonist..." or "They..." followed by a verb. This creates a monotonous rhythm that saps momentum. While generally clean, the writing relies more on telling and labeling ("analytically intuitive mind") than on showing through concrete, propulsive action, and some phrasing feels clichéd ("ethereal glow").

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and evocative, with a controlled rhythm. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting in the opening and in key descriptions, with dense clusters of figurative language ("every leaf whispered secrets and every petal hummed melodies"). This decorative density, while atmospheric, slightly slows momentum and can blur the line between evocative and overwrought, particularly with recurring abstract concepts like "auroral sorrow."

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean but relies on some stock phrasing ("heart of a sprawling port city," "against their better judgment"). Its primary weakness is the use of scaffolding and summary in the final paragraph. Lines like "In the end, Eli realized..." and "they were all tools to uncover this truth" abstract the climax into a tidy explanation, dulling the immediacy of the final image and slowing momentum where it should be most resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, but it is marred by a few key instances of overwriting. The adverbial phrase "spiralingly calm" is a self-conscious poeticism that, upon its third repetition, becomes a distracting artifact rather than a deepening motif. While much of the language is concise, these moments of strained lyricism feel out of place and slightly diminish the story's quiet power. They read as an effort to sound literary rather than an organic expression of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose contains some elegant phrasing ("forests of second thoughts"), but it is marred by repetition and abstraction. The phrase "amplified quiet" and the verb "cradle" are used redundantly, and key concepts like "the hush where past meets prophecy" are stated rather than evoked. The line-level craft prioritizes atmospheric summary over dense, sensory dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery ("emerald shafts," "hues of amber and violet"). However, it occasionally slips into abstraction ("something ancient and unknowable") and summary where dramatization would be stronger. The phrase "Her motivation was simple" is a moment of telling that slightly weakens the narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and evocative, with strong word choices that build a palpable atmosphere. Momentum is well-maintained through the focused action. The final paragraph, however, leans into summary ("a microcosm of her inner world," "pieces of a larger narrative"), which reads like scaffolding that explains the story's effects rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, but it suffers from minor but noticeable text artifacts that prevent it from reaching the highest tier. There are several instances of paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy, such as the repetition of "dissolving boundaries" and "tremor of certainty." While the imagery is strong, these repetitive scaffolds slightly blunt the momentum and information density of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by a reliance on summary and abstraction at key moments. The climax is narrated with scaffolding phrases like "In that moment, Elias understood," followed by an explanation of that understanding. This replaces the immediacy of a sensory or emotional experience with a less impactful intellectual report, dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clear and polished but relies heavily on abstract nouns ("energy," "connection," "heritage," "progress," "loss") that keep the experience at a conceptual remove. Pivotal moments of insight are often summarized ("she realized," "she felt her understanding deepen") instead of being rendered through concrete, sensory language. While free of grammatical errors, the sentence rhythm is uniform and lacks the propulsion needed to make the epiphanies land with visceral force.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and clear, with a deliberate, steady rhythm. There are no significant errors, but some phrases lean toward abstraction or cliché ("ethereal glow," "yearning to understand the unknowable"). While the language is often beautiful, it occasionally lacks the concision and momentum needed to make the quiet moments feel tense.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often elegant and precise, with strong imagery ("rain tapped against the skylight like a distant Morse code"). There is a slight tendency towards abstract summary when establishing concepts, such as in the second paragraph explaining the measuring tape's purpose. These moments slightly slow the momentum by telling what could be woven into action later on.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains evocative imagery, but its momentum is significantly hampered by repetitive phrasing. Key concepts like “atoms of nostalgia” and “anguished joy” are used as recurring labels rather than evolving motifs, creating a scaffold-like effect. The verbatim repetition of “steadily unpredictable” to describe two different things is a noticeable prose artifact that suggests a lack of line-level polish and detracts from the overall craft.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there are minor recurring artifacts. The phrase "softly deliberate" is repeated to the point of becoming a noticeable echo. A few word choices ("twisted and coiled") are standard, and the thematic statements in the conclusion feel like scaffolding that should have been removed. These small issues slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but leans on abstract nouns and declarative statements about emotion ("a sanctuary of reflection," "the reconstruction of her spirit"). There is a notable instance of telling over showing with the word "symbolizing," which explicitly interprets an action for the reader. The reliance on adjectives over stronger verbs creates a static, overly described texture that sometimes stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often lyrical, but occasionally slips into overwriting with phrases like "meteor hush" and "sanctuary of stillness." More critically, the story sometimes tells instead of shows emotion, especially at the climax ("the plants’ whispers became a chorus of gratitude"). These moments of summary slightly reduce the immediacy and impact of pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm ("each step a whisper of history"). The story maintains momentum through clear, concise language. A few minor instances of common phrasing ("hands trembling slightly," "a sense of purpose") slightly soften the otherwise sharp and specific line-level craft, preventing a higher score, but there are no significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly reducing the impact of individual images through saturation. There are minor instances of near-redundancy, such as "her method, her ritual." While generally beautiful, the relentless lyricism creates a uniform texture that could benefit from more rhythmic variation to make peak moments stand out more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clear, concise, and generally free of technical errors or distracting artifacts. However, it occasionally relies on scaffolding phrases that summarize instead of dramatizing, such as "Her motivation was clear" and "she had done what she came to do." These moments of telling slightly reduce the story's momentum and immediacy, preventing the line-level craft from reaching a higher tier of information density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, particularly in its descriptions of the setting. However, there is a tendency towards abstraction and summary during key moments, especially the climax ("he saw...the universe itself—its mechanisms, its mysteries, its beauty"). This telling approach dulls the immediacy of the epiphany. Additionally, the final two paragraphs read like a summary of change rather than a dramatization of it, losing some momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a high density of purposeful figurative language that builds a cohesive atmosphere. Sentences are well-constructed with varied rhythms that support the "shoreline lullaby" pace. While the density of metaphor risks becoming overwritten, it remains controlled and serves the story's tone. The piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, with strong opening and closing images. However, it's hindered by a recurring syntactic template ("It was not X, but Y...") and a tendency toward abstract, polysyllabic descriptors like "seraphically mundane" and "unpardonable silence." These artifacts, while fitting the tone, create slight conceptual drag and prevent the line-level craft from achieving true sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often lyrical, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are minor instances of overwriting and repetition that feel like artifacts, such as the repeated phrase "regally unpretentious." Certain constructions ("a gesture both graceful and unyielding," "a whisper that carried the weight of centuries") lean toward grandiosity without adding sufficient substance, preventing the prose from achieving flawless clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but a few moments rely on summary over dramatization. The line describing the emergent picture as tying everything together "to the very concept of delayed revelation" is an abstract label that dilutes the immediacy of the discovery. Similarly, the phrase "Periodically eternal" is a slightly clunky and ungrounded descriptor.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic, but suffers from a few key artifacts. A scaffolding sentence ("Lira’s motivation was clear:") and the direct thematic explanation in the final third interrupt momentum. Some metaphors, like "spark ready to reignite the flame," are functional but lean towards cliché, slightly dulling the otherwise strong craft.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is clean but leans on familiar, stock phrases and similes ("steam rose like ghosts," "shifting like molten lava," "began with a whisper, then a roar"). These clichés reduce the prose's freshness and impact, particularly during the climatic moments. The sentence structure is serviceable but lacks the rhythmic variety and density of top-tier craft.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clean but relies on some stock phrasing ("fluttered like a wounded bird") and scaffolding. The most significant issue is the inclusion of abstract, essayistic language at moments that call for concrete embodiment. Phrases like "anchor optimism in realism" and "capturing the resilience of the human spirit" are register drifts that dull the story's line-level propulsion and read like thematic summary rather than lived experience.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it occasionally suffers from overwriting. The repetition of "luminescent" three times risks turning a potent image into a tic. Some phrases ("fragments of a reality she could no longer grasp") are abstract where a more concrete sensory detail might have landed with greater force. Despite this, the sentence-level propulsion is generally strong and free of major artifacts like loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, with strong imagery in the opening paragraphs. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("piercing shade of blue," "heart quickened") and the final paragraph slips into summary. The last two sentences, in particular, abandon scene work for abstract statement ("even in darkness, there is light," "a testament to the power of..."), which dulls the impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean, but it suffers from repetitive phrasing that feels like scaffolding from a prompt. Key phrases—"contraband truths," "bravely conflicted," "dizzying quiet," "echoing library under snow," "in the blink that follows surprise"—are reused multiple times, creating a loop effect that dulls their impact and makes the writing feel mechanical rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, but it is hampered by several instances of abstract or ungrounded phrasing. Lines like "inculcate the plants with values" and "her touch senselessly perceptive" are conceptually fuzzy and feel like overwriting. These moments, combined with the explicit thematic statements that function as scaffolding, create minor but persistent friction that detracts from the story's immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative. However, the story suffers from a distinct prose artifact: the repeated use of the phrase "emotions were/are transliterated." This conceptual loop appears three times, functioning as a scaffold that explains the feeling rather than embodying it through varied, concrete language. This repetition slightly dulls the momentum and creates a sense of analytical distance in otherwise immersive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains some strong imagery but is hampered by a tendency to summarize and label emotional shifts ("her solemn playfulness giving way to a grim determination"). The final paragraph suffers from paraphrase loops and thematic statements that sap momentum from the final image. These scaffolding phrases prevent the line-level craft from achieving the clarity and propulsion required for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery like "meteor hush." Sentence structure is varied, and the rhythm supports the story's quiet, mournful mood. There is a slight tendency toward summarizing key transitions, such as the realization about the letters, where a more immediate, in-scene rendering would have been more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative, but its momentum is hampered by the repetitive use of key conceptual phrases ("emergent hush," "lilac unease"). This repetition feels like scaffolding and creates a slight template cadence. While the imagery is strong, the density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, and the synonym-loop quality of some descriptions slightly dulls the propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose aims for a poetic quality but is hampered by overwriting and a reliance on abstract nouns ("radicalism," "transformation," "existence"). Phrases like "cradle empathy in arms of steel" are conceptually dense but lack concrete immediacy. There is also thematic redundancy, with the core ideas of "renaming" and "mercy" being restated in similar terms, which slightly dulls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally evocative and clean, but it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("storm of blues and grays," "unfurling like secrets"). There are minor instances of overwriting and paraphrase-loops ("not just sound but a summons, a plea") that slightly dull momentum. While the line-level craft is competent, it lacks the consistent sharpness and specificity required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a reliance on abstract, high-concept jargon ("somatic markers," "fractally precise," "willowglass hope") that functions as labeling rather than description. There are moments of overwriting where modifiers stack up, and key actions are sometimes summarized rather than shown, as when her movements are simply called "fractally precise." These prose artifacts slightly dull the story's immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clear, graceful, and generally free of errors, with several effective images like the fossil's shadows "that danced like memories." Momentum is steady, and sentences are well-constructed. The writing occasionally slips into less specific phrasing ("heart racing," "profound connection") and abstraction ("factually mystical") where more concrete embodiment would have been stronger. The final paragraph functions more as a summary than a resonant, imagistic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and maintains a consistent rhythm. However, there are minor but noticeable craft issues that dull momentum, specifically paraphrase loops. The sentences "Each button...held a story—a thread of memory, a clue..." and the subsequent "Each button was a piece of a puzzle, a fragment..." restate the same idea without advancing it, an artifact that keeps the line-level craft from feeling flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but suffers from overwriting and a reliance on telling over showing. Phrases like "Its intricate engravings told a story of courage" summarize meaning rather than letting it arise from action. There are also moments of conceptual redundancy, such as defining the pillbox as "more than a container; it was a symbol." These artifacts create a descriptive density that sometimes stalls momentum instead of propelling it.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is carefully crafted but veers into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes feels self-conscious (e.g., "spindrift serenity"). There are minor instances of conceptual looping, such as when the motivation "to distill complexity into essence" is immediately paraphrased. While often beautiful, the line-level craft could benefit from more concision to sharpen its impact, especially around the central thematic statements.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and functional but lacks momentum and information density. Key concepts are delivered through declarative statements ("The glass was phototropic to kindness") rather than shown through evocative action or imagery. There is a reliance on telling over showing that flattens pivotal moments of discovery into simple statements of fact.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, particularly in its descriptions of the setting. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that dull its impact. The phrase "as if the world held its breath" is used twice in slightly different forms, and the repetition of "rhythm of oars in water" feels forced by the third mention, turning a potent image into a slightly mechanical motif.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, but it is marred by a significant text artifact: the repetitive use of the adjective "brittle" ("brittle determination," "brittle awakenings," "brittle light"). This recurrence feels forced and artificial, dulling the impact of the scenes it describes. Additionally, some sentences rely on declarative scaffolds ("Her motivation was clear:") that tell rather than show, slowing the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and precise word choice. The story avoids major artifacts like loops or scaffolding. A few phrases, such as "a testament to nature’s craftsmanship," lean towards cliché, and the final paragraph has a slightly summary tone that softens the immediacy of the preceding climax, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains good momentum without significant clutter or awkwardness. Its primary limitation is a reliance on functional but common phrasing ("The room seemed to hold its breath") and moments of summary where showing would be more powerful. While free of major errors, the line-level craft doesn't achieve the high information density or rhythmic propulsion of exceptional work.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and functional but prone to abstraction and telling over showing, particularly when describing internal states ("her heart yearning...while her mind cautioned"). There are instances of overwriting where concepts are defined immediately after being named, such as the description of spatial mutiny. While the rhythm is pleasant, greater concision and sensory grounding in key moments would increase momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("ghostly shroud") and abstract summary where concrete action would be stronger. The repetition of the key phrase "unification of opposites" acts as a scaffold, stating the theme rather than letting the final image do the work alone. These artifacts slightly dull the momentum, particularly around the story's conceptual core.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and competent, with some strong imagery like the map on the floor and the "tornado in reverse." However, there are instances of overwriting ("hummed with the eerie resonance") and reliance on stock phrasing ("scattered like fallen leaves," "trembling hands"). These moments slightly reduce the overall propulsion and information density of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and often lyrical, but it leans on abstract nouns and grand, thematic statements that can feel ungrounded ("a map of secrets," "amnesty...as a concept of liberation"). There are moments of telling over showing, such as stating Bridge-Song has "renewed determination." The craft is competent, but a greater focus on concrete, sensory detail over conceptual summary would increase its propulsive power.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and competent, but it is hampered by several instances of authorial scaffolding. Lines like "he realized that the train wasn’t just a relic—it was a symbol..." explicitly state thematic significance rather than letting the image do the work. The repetition of key phrases such as “perceptively calm” and “dusky harmony” feels more like a template than an organic part of the narrative texture, dulling the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and competent, with a consistent rhythm. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("burned brighter than any star," "connect the dots") and abstract concepts ("tapestry of hope") where more specific, concrete imagery would have a greater impact. There are no major technical flaws, but the line-level craft lacks the sharpness and surprise of exceptional work.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and generally purposeful, but it leans heavily on abstract compound concepts like "warlike serenity" and "frozen confession," which feel slightly overwrought. While the rhythm is controlled, there is a lack of sentence-level variety in some paragraphs, creating a steady rather than dynamic pace. The final paragraph loses momentum by summarizing the theme rather than ending on a potent, concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean but exhibits several minor artifacts. There are instances of telling over showing ("her purposefully curious mind unraveling the mystery") and paraphrase loops (the repetition of "anxious elation"). While the sentences are grammatically sound, they lack the high information density and syntactic variety expected of top-tier prose, resulting in moments that feel slightly sluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong control of imagery. Sentences are generally well-crafted and propel the narrative forward. However, there are moments where the writing strains for a literary effect, leading to phrases that feel slightly overworked or overly tidy, such as the parallel structure in the final paragraph ("to carve another story, to plant another seed, to mend another soul"). This prevents an otherwise strong performance from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and clear, with good momentum. The primary weakness lies in a few instances of summarizing emotion ("echo the emptiness he felt inside") and a slight tendency toward paraphrase loops. For instance, the final paragraph explains the thematic significance of the shift that the preceding paragraph had already dramatized, creating a moment of redundancy that slightly dulls the sharpness of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clear, grammatically sound, and maintains a steady momentum. However, it relies on several genre clichés and stock phrases ("a surge of energy," "a wave of understanding washed over her," "mix of fear and excitement"). The sentence structure lacks variety, resulting in a rhythm that is smooth but monotonous, preventing the language from achieving a higher level of artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong imagery. However, there are moments of abstract phrasing that slightly dull the momentum ("currents of existence," "heart of the atrium"). The final line, "After tomorrow disappeared," is a significant flaw; it's an abrupt, un-scaffolded piece of poeticism that is tonally consistent but logically disconnected from the established world, ending the story on a note of confusion rather than resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and competent, with some evocative phrases. However, it suffers from occasional abstract scaffoldings ("a carrier of something profound") and paraphrase loops ("It was a vessel, a carrier..."). These moments of telling rather than showing slightly dull the momentum and information density, preventing the line-level craft from achieving true propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative but occasionally overwrought, with phrases like "silent sentinel" and "cathedral of decay" feeling self-consciously literary. The word "gleezing" is non-standard and distracting. The final paragraph's use of "allude to her own story" is imprecise and slightly weakens an otherwise strong closing beat. While mostly clean, these moments of strained lyricism and slight imprecision detract from the overall propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, with strong imagery ("walls pulsed with an ethereal light"). However, a few moments rely on slightly generic phrasing ("a mix of fear and hope") or conceptual summary ("words held power beyond comprehension"). The line-level craft is strong but occasionally misses the opportunity for sharper, more surprising word choices, preventing it from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong sensory language. There are, however, minor but noticeable artifacts of overwriting, such as the repetition of "mulberry ache" and the use of conceptually heavy but vague terms like "perforated destiny." Some sentences rely on a template cadence ("The violin was more than X; it was Y") that feels slightly mechanical for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and controlled, but relies on some familiar phrasing ("story untold," "heart pounding," "tremor in her soul") that slightly dulls its impact. Momentum is strong until the final two paragraphs, which slip into summary ("As the hours passed, Elara felt a shift within her..."). This strategic choice to tell rather than show the final internal transformation makes the ending feel less immediate and impactful than the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, with strong imagery in the first half ("vineyard hush"). However, the final third relies too heavily on telling over showing, particularly in summarizing the climax and resolution. Several sentences become abstract and didactic ("The cycle of rebirth had taught her..."), losing the sensory immediacy and momentum established earlier. This shift into explanatory language dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and conceptual summary. Lines like "It was an object of peculiar significance, tied to the core concept of the cloak of doubt" are overwritten and clunky. The story often tells the reader about concepts ("protected vulnerability," "balance") instead of showing them through concrete action or imagery. This tendency to scaffold its own meaning slows the momentum and distances the reader from the sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound but leans on abstract phrasing and lacks consistent propulsion. Sentences like "her mind slipping into a trance, the timeframe of her meditation stretching beyond the present" are functional but slightly cumbersome. The final paragraph summarizes the theme rather than grounding the closure in a final, concrete image, missing an opportunity for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, but it occasionally relies on abstract scaffolding instead of concrete embodiment (e.g., "...their mind sharp with the knowledge that..."). There is some conceptual redundancy with words like "stillness," "pulse," and "rhythms," which, while thematic, slightly dulls the momentum in places. The piece is well-crafted but would benefit from a final polish to sharpen its specificity and remove these minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    While generally clear, the prose is hindered by a reliance on stock phrases and clichés, such as "Panic surged through," "trembling hands," and "a surge of energy coursed through him." The intentional but awkward repetition of "brilliance dimness" feels forced. The concluding paragraphs lose momentum due to their repetitive and summary-driven nature.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, a few phrases like "a rush of understanding" and "without thinking" rely on cliché and narrative shortcuts, slightly dulling the immediacy of key moments. While the overall quality is very high, these minor instances of telling rather than showing prevent it from reaching a higher tier of line-level perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and generally possesses a strong rhythmic quality. However, a few instances of conceptual redundancy and abstract phrasing slightly dull its momentum. For example, the motivation is described in several similar ways ("find meaning," "sought understanding," "wavelength align"). While the overall effect is strong, these minor loops and occasional telling statements prevent the prose from reaching flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and evocative, with a controlled rhythm that supports the story’s somber mood. There are minor instances of overwriting and reliance on familiar phrasing ("crumbled purpose," "shards of night") that prevent it from reaching the highest tier of craft. While the sentences are well-constructed, they lack the consistent information density and surprising precision required for a truly flawless piece.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong opening imagery. The rhythm of the sentences effectively supports the story's quiet, deliberate momentum. The score is slightly limited by a few instances of cliché phrasing ("heart swelling with hope") and the declarative, summary-like quality of the final paragraph, which trades resonant imagery for less impactful explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear, but it suffers from repetition and thematic looping in the final two paragraphs. Key concepts like "resurfacing," "forgotten," and "shared meaning" are stated multiple times, creating a sense of paraphrase that dulls the momentum of the ending. This scaffolding language prioritizes telegraphing the theme over allowing the final image to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, with a consistent, elevated tone. Its primary flaw is a tendency towards overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and evocative but vague descriptors ("ancient freshness," "quiet power," "touch of wonder") that slightly dull momentum. Some sentences also serve as thematic scaffolding ("Elara’s motivation was clear..."), a form of telling that could be replaced by sharper, more active prose.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness. It suffers from frequent overwriting, abstraction, and paraphrase loops ("That memory was not just a recollection but a guide..."). Phrases like "soundless echo" are tautological, and conceptual summaries replace dramatized action, measurably dulling momentum. These text artifacts prevent the story from achieving the crisp, high-density line-level craft required for this echelon of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and conceptual language ("hum with the energy of its purpose," "vivification of their soul") where more concrete imagery would be impactful. The sentence "As history rewrote itself outside the dojo..." is a grand but disconnected statement that adds little momentum. The lack of sentence-level propulsion makes some passages feel static rather than urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and contains some evocative phrasing, but it is hampered by moments of summary and repetition. The paragraph explaining what Elias concluded about the key ("The key was a puzzle piece...") halts momentum by telling instead of showing. The repeated phrase "storm-born silence" is a minor artifact that lessens its own impact, and some sentence structures feel formulaic, holding the craft back from a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but occasionally tips into overwriting. Figurative language is dense, and some phrases like "shadows danced like old memories" lean on cliché. A minor paraphrase loop ("a plea, a prayer, a desperate attempt") slightly dulls the momentum. These instances, while small, prevent the prose from achieving flawless clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it occasionally dips into overwriting with stacked descriptors ("frozen garden, shrouded in an eternal mist") and abstract concepts that slow momentum. There are no significant grammatical errors, and the rhythm is generally controlled. However, a reliance on conceptual labels over concrete, sensory details in key moments of interiority keeps the prose from being truly immersive and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is clean and generally clear, but it relies on abstract nouns and some conventional imagery ("heart...blooming with hope"). There are no significant errors, but the sentence-level propulsion could be stronger, and a few phrases lean toward telling emotional states rather than embodying them through action.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is generally clean but relies on repetitive phrasing to emphasize its theme (e.g., multiple "The shard of hush was not..." constructions). In key moments, it defaults to abstraction ("a continuous cycle of creation and renewal") instead of grounding the climax in concrete, sensory detail. This tendency toward summary over dramatization dulls the impact of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of adjectives ("spectral," "otherworldly," "inexplicable," "unconventional") and abstract summary phrases. There is some redundancy, such as the repeated mention of Mara's "resiliently positive" nature. The sentence structure lacks compelling rhythmic variety, resulting in functional but unmemorable line-level craft that doesn't always propel the narrative forward.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose demonstrates rhythmic control, but is burdened by a high density of abstract, self-referential concepts ("rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary"). These terms act as labels rather than descriptions, and their repetition creates a layer of overwriting that slightly dulls the immediacy of the action, particularly in the opening paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often elegant, with high information density in its descriptions. Sentences like "bioluminescent streets wound like veins through the deep" are vivid and efficient. While a few phrases like "balancedly curious" are slightly awkward, there are no significant loops or artifacts, and the overall craft is a clear strength, propelling the narrative with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and controlled but occasionally lapses into cliché ("radiant and haunted") and redundancy. Some sentences state what has just been shown, slowing momentum, as in the summary of her motivations before she leaves. While free of major errors, the line-level craft lacks the high information density and syntactic variety needed for the highest tier, preferring to label states rather than embody them in concrete, surprising language.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, but it occasionally relies on stock phrases ("hub of innovation," "choked with silt and secrets"). The line "The facility’s decay mirrored her own internal struggle" is an instance of telling instead of showing symbolism. While generally strong, these moments of slight overwriting and authorial summary hold the craft back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and propels the narrative forward without significant error. However, it suffers from a high density of similes ("like a forgotten relic," "like a broken promise," "like galaxies," "like fireflies," "like a thousand opals"). This clustering of figurative language, while atmospheric, can feel overwrought and slightly reduces the prose's momentum and specificity, particularly in moments of rising tension.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and generally clear, but held back by minor, recurring issues. Phrasing such as "like a living entity" feels conventional in an otherwise original world. There is also a slight tendency towards repetitive sentence structures, particularly the "She was no longer..." formulation, which appears twice and slightly dulls the impact of the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is ambitious but burdened by conceptual overwriting and repetition that acts as a scaffold. Phrases like "gravitationally playful" are more abstract than evocative, and the repeated thematic tags ("harmony untamed," etc.) create redundancy. While individual sentences are often well-crafted, the momentum is occasionally slowed by this tendency toward telling over showing through concrete, sensory action.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and generally clear, with strong imagery. However, there are minor instances of overwriting and scaffolding that slightly reduce momentum. The repetition of "the gap between knowing and understanding" and the "She knew... She knew..." sequence in the third paragraph, while establishing her mindset, reads like a template cadence. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong rhythm and clarity, particularly in the tense action sequence. The language is dense with evocative imagery without sacrificing momentum. Minor deductions are for a high concentration of figurative language in the opening that verges on overwriting and a few phrases that echo earlier sentiments, creating a faint sense of repetition near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it suffers from overwriting. Nearly every sentence is laden with figurative language ("echo of laughter," "shaping wood into dreams," "whispering gleam," "tapestry of forgotten dreams"), which cumulatively dulls the impact and feels stylistically forced. This high density of poeticism creates a texture that is rich but lacks the concision and punch required for the highest tier of literary craft.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong opening imagery like "labyrinth of whispers." However, minor artifacts prevent it from reaching the highest tier. The sentence "her sanely eccentric nature guiding her with precision" is a moment of telling over showing. There are also a few moments of common phrasing ("heart pounding") that stand out against the more unique descriptions, creating a slight inconsistency in the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, but suffers from a tendency towards abstraction and conceptual summary. Phrases like "bridging the gap between what was and what could be" and "it was a ritual, a way to vitalize her longing" explain rather than dramatize. There's also a high density of figurative language that, while often lovely, can occasionally feel overwrought and slow the momentum leading into the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clear but often opts to tell instead of show, using declarative scaffolds like "Her motivation was clear" and "her resolve unshakable." Figurative language tends toward abstraction ("a fragile thread of hope stretched across the hush of cosmic possibility") rather than concrete imagery. While grammatically sound, the line-level craft lacks the precision, concision, and propulsion expected of top-tier fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and clear, but it is hampered by several instances of telling over showing and some repetitive phrasing. The threefold use of "decades later" acts as a noticeable prose artifact that dulls momentum. While the sentences are grammatically sound, they lack the high information density and rhythmic propulsion of exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, its high density of figurative language sometimes borders on overwriting, creating a slight filter between the reader and the character's direct experience. The repetition of the key phrase "combative tenderness" is a minor but noticeable artifact that slightly dulls its initial impact.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clean but overwrought, with a high density of abstract, figurative language that dulls momentum. The piece suffers from prose artifacts, including template cadences ("It was no ordinary seed; it was a bridge..." followed by "It was not a typical plant; it was a portal...") and repetitive phrasing ("radiant hush," "hush of budding hope"), which makes the writing feel self-conscious and less immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong rhythm. However, there are instances of overwriting and reliance on abstraction where concrete detail would be stronger (e.g., "a silence that accumulated"). The line "ready to sever the threads of time" is a well-worn cliché that stands out in an otherwise carefully crafted piece. These minor artifacts, while not impeding clarity, prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier of precision and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clear, concise, and generally well-crafted, avoiding major errors. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable scaffolding and conceptual loops. Phrases like "interpret silence with empathy" are repeated, and the action "reopen" is explicitly tied to its metaphorical meaning twice. This tendency towards abstraction and repetition, while not severe, slightly dulls the momentum and information density required for the highest tier of literary prose.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative, melancholic atmosphere effectively. The primary weakness is the inclusion of the overt thematic statement near the end, which functions as a form of "telling" that briefly halts the story's momentum and replaces image-driven propulsion with abstract explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and figurative language that can feel decorative and cloying ("luminous figure, both ethereal and solid," "scattered like stardust"). This saturation tends to flatten the narrative dynamics. The final paragraph devolves into summary and sets up a generic continuation ("her work was far from over"), a prose artifact that weakens the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, clear, and grammatically sound, with a steady rhythm. However, it suffers from some repetitive sentence structures ("The [Nth] floor...") and a recurring reliance on the verb "unfold." While thematically relevant, the repetition becomes mechanical. The language is serviceable but lacks the information density and syntactic variety needed for truly propulsive or memorable line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the sky. However, peak moments sometimes rely on abstraction ("fragments of lives," "tapestry of existence") where more concrete sensory detail would have been more powerful. The final paragraph especially leans on summary ("she had proven her theory"), slightly dulling the immediacy of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density. However, there are minor but noticeable prose artifacts, including a template cadence ("It was a stillness...", "It was a key...", "It was a puzzle..."). While the rhythm is generally strong, these repetitive structures slightly dull the propulsion in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, clear, and evocative, with strong word choice and varied sentence rhythms that support the story’s momentum. Information is delivered with good density, avoiding significant clutter or redundancy. While a few phrases lean toward telling over showing (e.g., "diligently curious nature compelled her"), the overall line-level craft is of a high standard.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is fluid and generally clear, with a good sense of rhythm. However, there are minor instances of overwriting and cliché that dull its sharpness ("air was thick with the scent," "heart pounded"). The repetition of "hauntingly bright" is a small but noticeable artifact. These elements prevent the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional level, feeling more like polished genre prose than truly surprising literary work.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose contains moments of lovely description, particularly in the opening paragraph. However, it frequently slips into stock phrasing ("faded to a faint memory," "cascading like a waterfall of stars") and occasionally uses mixed metaphors ("hope brambling...like a thread"). While clear and competent, the line-level craft lacks the precision and propulsion needed for top-tier literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from several minor artifacts that dull its impact. There is some scaffolding ("Her motivation was clear:") and conceptual repetition ("beautifully flawed" is used as a descriptor twice in quick succession). The density of figurative language, while establishing tone, occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly impeding the story's otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose contains moments of sharp, effective imagery ("offhandedly exact," "whirred like broken gears") that demonstrate real craft. However, these are offset by passages that feel slightly overwritten or rely on familiar constructions ("loomed like a fractured spine"). The piece would benefit from a rigorous line edit to trim excess adjectives and allow the stronger verbs and images to carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery. Momentum is well-maintained. The primary flaw is a minor tendency toward conceptual tautology and abstract declarations where concrete sensory detail would be stronger (e.g., "structural harmony"). The repetition of "symphonically" is a small loop, and a few phrases like "clear as the river itself" lean on cliché, holding the prose back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and generally polished, with strong opening and closing images. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting, with dense adjectival phrases that sometimes slow the momentum ("a marvel of transparent towers and crystalline branches, floated serenely upon a swirling sea of clouds"). While beautiful, this density can feel slightly labored in moments of action, sacrificing some propulsion for description.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative but is hampered by moments of overwriting and a tendency to summarize key emotional beats. Phrases like "threatened to overwhelm her" followed immediately by "her resolve unshaken" state the emotional stakes without allowing them to unfold on the line. The final paragraph relies on scaffolding ("felt different now, cleansed") rather than allowing the preceding image of the dissolving pavilion to carry the emotional weight on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from a tendency toward overwriting and abstraction, particularly with thematic labels. Phrases like "hush of borrowed starlight" are used twice, becoming a noticeable tic. The final paragraph abandons scene work for summary, and several sentences state abstract concepts rather than showing concrete, sensory details that would carry the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, but it's hampered by a reliance on high-concept, abstract jargon ("helix-minded," "synaptic plasticity," "quaking reverie") that can feel like overwriting. These terms act as conceptual scaffolding rather than emerging from concrete detail, slightly dulling the immediacy of Elara’s experience and slowing momentum in an otherwise well-paced piece.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from overwriting, particularly a reliance on stacked, portentous adjectives that feel like prompt fulfillment ("serpentine grotto," "prism-minded archivist," "clandestine pool," "clandestinely luminous"). Some phrasing, like the repetition of "latent blaze," feels slightly mechanical. While the syntax is varied, these artifacts dull the momentum and specificity of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, but it suffers from minor conceptual redundancy. The core motivation is stated in slightly different ways in the second paragraph, creating a paraphrase loop. Figurative language is occasionally dense, bordering on overwritten ("conducting an orchestra of shadows and silence"), which slightly slows momentum rather than enhancing the quiet, focused action.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean but suffers from telling over showing ("she felt a surge of clarity") and includes scaffold-like phrases that feel like remnants of a prompt ("sought to correlate," "a motivation to discover"). The repetition of the key phrase "thoughtfully precise" in a very short text is a notable artifact. These elements slightly blunt the momentum and immediacy of pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and generally avoids error, but it leans on scaffolding and telling at key moments ("Elara’s motivation was clear..."). Several phrases trend toward the generic ("tapestry of unspoken stories," "symphony of sound"), and the climax is followed by abstract summary rather than concrete imagery. While momentum is maintained, the information density could be higher and the reliance on adjectival qualification could be reduced in favor of stronger verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and word choice. However, the climax and resolution rely heavily on abstract nouns and overly refined conceptual language ("profound understanding," "interconnectedness," "newfound clarity"). This density of abstraction in a peak moment dulls the emotional impact and reads as overwriting, telling the reader the meaning instead of letting the image convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and generally concise, with good momentum. However, it occasionally slips into cliché ("her heart raced") or summary where embodied detail would be stronger ("the grove erupted in light...their resilience restored"). The final paragraph's shift into abstract nouns and thematic summary ("purpose," "resilience," "balance") flattens the otherwise vivid sensory language of the piece, feeling like scaffolding left in the finished structure.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clear and contains some strong images, like the containers' insides "spilled like the guts of a giant." However, it's hampered by repetitive abstract concepts ("singular convergence," used twice) and scaffolding phrases that summarize internal processes ("Elara’s rapidly adapting mind had already begun piecing together the fragments"). These instances of telling over showing create momentum drag in key analytical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished but tends towards high conceptual density and overwriting, with phrases like "promise of stillness" and "sculpted hush that whispered." Minor paraphrase loops, such as "silence for emptiness, hush for absence," slightly impede momentum. The overall effect is artful but lacks the concision that would make it truly powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but lacks the polish of a final draft, showing minor but noticeable artifacts. There are instances of clichéd phrasing ("heart pounding in her chest"), a small paraphrase loop ("The canyon hush seemed to deepen, the silence becoming almost tangible"), and repetition of key phrases. These elements slightly dull the momentum and prevent the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional standard.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and conceptual jargon ("transposed empathy," "lucid turbulence"). There is a pattern of summarizing internal shifts with phrases like "he felt" and "he realized," which tells the reader about the change rather than showing it through visceral detail. This preference for the abstract over the concrete dulls the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, a few minor flaws prevent a top-tier score, including a noticeable grammatical error ("teachings echoes") and the use of slightly worn phrases ("heavier somehow," "a void she couldn’t fill"). While these do not derail the story, they represent small blemishes on an otherwise polished surface for a publication where flawlessness is the standard.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it occasionally slips into overwriting with familiar phrases like "a thousand hues" or "captured stars." A template cadence appears in paragraph three ("She closed her eyes... She took a deep breath... She began to commune..."), which momentarily flattens the rhythm. The final paragraph contains some scaffolding that explains the theme rather than letting the final image do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. There are, however, minor instances of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly dense, such as "the bamboo rustled with the hush of time's unraveling tapestry." These moments are infrequent and do not disrupt momentum or clarity, but they prevent the prose from achieving flawless concision.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from a tendency to tell rather than show, particularly regarding character states ("Eli was quietly determined"). Pivotal moments of struggle are summarized ("Hours turned into days as he descended"), which stalls momentum at a crucial point. There are also instances of abstract authorial analysis, such as "a strange blend that mirrored the duality of his life," which pulls the reader out of the immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains a steady momentum. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("thickening like a curtain being drawn," "symphony of whispers") that lessens its impact. More critically, the final two paragraphs shift into a summary-heavy mode, using repetitive sentence structures ("Her role was to...", "The repair bay was no longer just...") that scaffold the conclusion rather than dramatizing it.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is clear, concise, and maintains momentum. However, the final paragraph shifts into summary, telling the reader the meaning of the events rather than letting the final actions carry the weight. There are also moments of stock phrasing ("sinking into him like an anchor") that slightly dull the otherwise competent craft. The overall construction is solid but lacks the line-level invention of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clear and functional but is hampered by several genre clichés, most notably the opening "sword of light." While generally concise, there are moments of overwriting and minor paraphrase loops that dull momentum, such as "They understood. This was no accident." The line-level craft is solid but lacks the precision and information density required for a top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and concise, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. The descriptions of the setting and the blue morpho wing are particularly effective. The primary flaw at the line-level is the stilted, unnatural quality of the dialogue, which disrupts the otherwise smooth narrative rhythm and reads as written rather than spoken language.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean but leans on abstractions and summary in the final paragraphs, dulling the impact of the closure ("as though a burden had been lifted," "part of a greater story"). Some figurative language feels familiar ("painted the stone in silver"). The final two paragraphs shift from showing the miracle to explaining its meaning, which slows momentum at the most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often evocative, but suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought. More critically, the final two paragraphs slip into summary, telling the reader the outcome ("The forgotten songs, now remembered, knit the realm together") rather than showing it through Elara's immediate sensory experience. This narrative scaffolding at the climax dulls the story's propulsive energy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from several artifacts that dull its impact. The phrase "enlarged tranquility" is used awkwardly for both Thaddeus's voice and Elara's final feeling, reading like an inorganic insertion. Other phrases like "whispered tales of worlds unseen" are abstract and lack specificity. The story tells more than it shows in key moments, summarizing emotional states ("felt a strange connection") rather than embodying them in action or specific sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced. Sentences are constructed with care, creating a smooth, readable rhythm. The primary weakness is a tendency towards abstraction, where concepts like "tenuous absolution" or "heuristically gentle" are named rather than fully embodied in concrete action or sensory detail. There are no significant loops or artifacts, but information density could be higher in moments of reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with standout phrases like "silence hung like a quartz hush." However, it occasionally relies on stock phrasing ("threads in a tapestry," "renewed purpose") that slightly dulls its sharpness. A minor template cadence ("Her motivation was... Her gently meticulous nature... Her motivation deepened...") is also present, preventing the prose from achieving flawless momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, with good rhythm and clarity. It excels at establishing atmosphere through strong, concrete imagery. There are no significant loops or artifacts. However, several phrases rely on familiar constructions ("her heart quickened," "tension palpable," "bravado cracking") that slightly dull the prose's edge in key moments. The final paragraph also shifts into summary ("She’d thwarted the thieves..."), which sacrifices immediacy for exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level prose is elegant and controlled, with evocative phrasing and a strong rhythmic quality. The language effectively builds the story's unique atmosphere. While there is a reliance on invented jargon like "terrestrially cosmic," it is consistent with the world's logic. The piece is clean, concise, and demonstrates a high degree of technical polish without significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally evocative and controlled, but it occasionally dips into overwriting with high-register, slightly ornate phrasing like "auroral sorrow" and "rectification of years of silence." While the rhythm and flow are strong, some descriptions in the opening paragraph feel familiar ("dimly lit recesses," "precision born of years of practice"), preventing the line-level craft from reaching an elite level of sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely free of artifacts, demonstrating strong command of rhythm and imagery. Sentences like "towering glass domes pierced the toxic sky" and "Her hands, delicate yet calloused" establish character and world with high information density. While a few phrases lean toward familiar constructions ("weight of silence"), the overall craft is precise and propulsive, carrying the story's momentum without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("kissed the heavens," "tears of the gods") and has moments of high figurative density that border on overwriting. The repetition of "muted vigor" is a minor but noticeable artifact that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, clear, and carries the story forward effectively. However, it suffers from minor prose artifacts, specifically the repetition of key conceptual phrases like "strangely organic" and "fragmented wholeness." This makes certain moments feel like they are checking a list rather than flowing from the narrative, slightly dulling the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear and grammatically sound, with a pleasant rhythm in the opening. However, it relies on some familiar phrasing ("heart quickened," "mind raced") and contains a slightly muddled metaphor in "the sandstorm calm of the moment." The final paragraph becomes overly declarative, summarizing the theme and diluting the power of the preceding scene with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic but is hampered by a tendency to summarize internal states and abstract concepts ("Her presence seemed to defy the despair," "Her calm defiance had become a force"). There are several instances of telling over showing, which stalls momentum. While free of major grammatical errors, the line-level craft relies too often on declarative statements where concrete imagery would be more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong opening and closing images. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrases ("sand through his fingers") and a notable moment of telling instead of showing ("What happened next was beyond description"). The density is good, but a few more concrete sensory details within the memory-space itself, rather than a summary of the experience, would have elevated the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but it occasionally relies on abstract, high-concept phrasing that can feel slightly ungrounded (e.g., "bend silence into shape," "terrestrially cosmic"). There is also a minor prose artifact in the repetition of the "tranquil blaze" metaphor, which reads as self-conscious overwriting. While generally strong, these moments of lexical strain slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative from the opening line. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic effect and high information density, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting. The language is consistently clear and purposeful, achieving a sense of magic without sacrificing clarity, particularly in the crucial final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, particularly in its descriptions of the garden. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting and relies on stock phrases ("her heart raced," "a flood of emotions") that dull the otherwise sharp imagery. The final paragraph's direct summary of the thematic resolution is a significant flaw in craft, sacrificing momentum and resonance for tidy explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative but hampered by several issues. There are stock images ("mist in the morning sun," "a chain breaking within her soul") that dull the otherwise specific texture. A few paraphrase loops occur, such as stating her job is to "erase" and then to "unlink the threads of truth." These instances of overwriting and cliché prevent the prose from achieving the highest level of precision.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is burdened by overwriting and a density of ornate, abstract adjectives ("serpentine nexus," "richly perceptive," "reed-blown melancholy"). This stylistic choice often obscures meaning and slows momentum, prioritizing decoration over clarity and propulsion. Sentences are grammatically sound but lack the concision and impact required for high-level publication, reading more as an exercise in atmospheric description than sharp storytelling.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is held back by minor-yet-noticeable flaws. Moments of telling ("The object felt heavy... in the secrets it carried") and stock phrasing ("her motivation burned brighter") soften the impact. While free of significant errors, the piece lacks the consistent line-level propulsion and information density required for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is elegant but frequently overwritten, relying on dense adjectival phrases ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") and abstract summaries of emotion. Some sentences state what could be shown, such as, "Her mind, always in motion, began to trace these paths," which slows momentum. While grammatically clean, the rhythm is uniformly meditative, lacking the syntactic variety to reflect shifts in intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.8)
    While the prose is clear, it is marred by conspicuous repetition that reads like authorial scaffolding. The phrase "sharply observant" appears three times as a label, which is a significant prose artifact that weakens characterization. Sentence structures are functional but tend toward a monotonous cadence, lacking the rhythmic variety needed for a truly polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with a good rhythmic flow. However, there are minor artifacts that prevent a higher score. The repetition of the specific phrase "gritty whimsy" feels like an authorial signpost rather than an organic description. Some sentences rely on slightly abstract nouns ("a cascade of energy," "a sense of both danger and possibility") where more concrete imagery could have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-varied, propelling the narrative forward with a consistent rhythm. There is a minor tendency toward stacking descriptors in a single beat ("positively wistful expression that carried both sorrow and joy"), which slightly lessens the impact, but there are no significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is mostly clear and often evocative, but it is hampered by periodic overwriting and reliance on abstract terminology. Phrases like "vibrational disharmony was palpable, a discordant note in the symphony of existence" are conceptually redundant and dull the impact of the moment. While there are no major grammatical errors, a stricter economy of language would heighten the story's propulsion and power.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and overwriting. Sentences are built around concepts rather than concrete images, leading to a low information density ("Her motivation was clear: to sculpt patience from impatience, a task she believed would ignite a patient revolution."). This conceptual weight slows momentum and creates a sense of being told a philosophical treatise instead of experiencing a story. There's a lack of sentence-level propulsion and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean but contains several instances of overwriting and cliché, such as "shadows that seemed to reverberate with whispers of the past" and "calm exterior belying the storm of thoughts within." The final paragraph resorts to telling ("Elara knew the road ahead would be treacherous") where showing would be more impactful. These moments of stylistic flourish and summary weaken the otherwise solid craft.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally avoids major artifacts. The sentence structure varies, creating a smooth narrative flow. However, some figurative language feels slightly overwrought or clichéd, such as "settled over him like a cloak" or the poetic but somewhat forced "By the way light breaks through storm clouds." These moments slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely carries the story's momentum effectively. Sentence structure is varied, and the descriptions of the workshop and the algorithm are rendered with clarity. There are minor instances of scaffolding, particularly in stating character traits or motivations directly ("a quest fueled by her own yearning..."). These moments are brief but prevent the prose from achieving the flawless density required for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clear, concise, and maintains momentum effectively, avoiding significant artifacts or clutter. There are no major grammatical errors or confusing sentences. However, some phrasing trends toward the functional rather than the evocative, and a few moments of high tension rely on familiar constructions. Overall, the craft is solid and professional but lacks the line-level sharpness and information density of truly exceptional work.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.0)
    While the prose is clean, it suffers from a reliance on telling over showing and employs several clichés ("glinting like ancient eyes," "resolve hardening like the ice floes"). The narrative frequently summarizes states of being ("pulsed faintly with an otherworldly energy") instead of rendering them through concrete sensory detail. This tendency toward abstraction dulls the immediacy of key moments and weakens the overall impact.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong control of rhythm and imagery. Sentence structure varies effectively to match the contemplative pace. There is a minor instance of a paraphrase-loop early on, where Elara’s motivation is stated in two slightly different ways in the same paragraph, which momentarily slows momentum. Otherwise, the language is concise and purposeful, with no significant artifacts muddying the peak emotional beats or the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. There are minor instances of register drift into academic language ("nurture intersubjective understanding") that feel slightly out of place for the character's internal voice in that moment. The overall craft is high, with no significant loops or scaffolding, but these small dissonances prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and generally well-controlled, but it sometimes strains for effect with compound descriptors ("whisperfield calm," "strangely honest heart") that feel slightly overwritten. There are minor redundancies where an action is explained rather than allowed to speak for itself (e.g., stating her voice has "strange authority" just as the stones respond to it). The piece is free of major artifacts but could achieve greater power through more concision.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean but suffers from overwriting, with an over-reliance on adjectives and abstract nouns ("subtle puzzle archivist," "perceptively calm demeanor"). This density of description sometimes slows momentum rather than enhances it. Several key ideas are stated and then paraphrased in slightly different terms across paragraphs, creating a subtle redundancy that dulls the impact of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong opening and closing lines. However, there is a minor but consistent habit of scaffolding, where a concrete image is immediately followed by an explanatory sentence that articulates its thematic meaning (e.g., "Each sound was a piece of a puzzle... suspended and waiting to be reassembled"). This slightly undermines the prose's power by telling the reader what to feel or think, preventing the story from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm and syntax effectively mirror the protagonist's deliberate, searching pace. However, a few moments dip into familiar turns of phrase ("weight of time pressing on him") that stand out against the otherwise fresh and specific language. While there are no significant artifacts, these minor slips in precision prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it leans heavily on abstract concepts ("manifestation of escape velocity," "harness the ephemeral," "essence of time itself") that can feel overwritten. This high register, combined with a somewhat uniform sentence rhythm, dulls the momentum in places. Some phrases, like "changelessly constant stillness," contain redundancies that could be tightened for greater impact, preventing the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and serves the story's purpose, but it often relies on familiar, slightly overwrought phrasing ("radiant haven," "eternal glow," "faint smile graced her lips"). While some descriptions are effective, there is a tendency towards abstraction over concrete, sharp imagery. This softness, combined with a few clichéd descriptions, prevents the line-level craft from achieving the precision and freshness of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is clean and clear but suffers from some rhythmic monotony due to repetitive sentence structures, particularly at the start of paragraphs. Some key moments, such as the process of relearning the runes, are summarized rather than fully dramatized. While generally concise, there are moments of familiar phrasing like "echoes of a forgotten song" that feel slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with a good rhythmic flow. However, it sometimes slips into conceptual language that summarizes feeling rather than embodying it ("a cleft in certainty where mistakes could be reshaped"). The final sentence's use of "nostalgic innovation" feels like a slightly discordant, intellectual intrusion. A few clichés ("heart pounding," "bones were being reset") slightly dull the impact of otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, but it is hampered by an over-density of figurative language, particularly similes in the first half that slightly dull its momentum. The primary flaw is the final sentence, which feels overwritten and abstract ("zephyr bloom of her spirit carried her forward"). This linguistic choice slightly muddles the otherwise concrete and powerful closure, replacing a tangible action with a poetic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and demonstrates high information density. Figurative language is generally strong and purposeful. The primary weakness is a minor but noticeable reliance on scaffolding, such as the direct statement "Elara’s motivation was clear:". This type of authorial signposting, while efficient, slightly lessens the immersive quality by telling the reader what to think rather than letting the scene do the work entirely on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from a persistent pattern of overwriting, relying on abstract nouns and intangible concepts ("surge of understanding," "resounding voice") where concrete imagery would be stronger. Several paraphrase loops and redundant sentence structures appear, slowing momentum and dulling an otherwise potent atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose is fluid and clear, with a pleasant rhythm. However, it relies on several stock phrases and metaphors ("secrets waiting to be unlocked," "bathed the arbor in a warm, golden glow") that soften its impact. The line "Each thread held a remedy, a solution to the troubles" is a minor paraphrase loop that could be more concise. While technically proficient, the line-level craft lacks the sharpness and originality to elevate the story to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and evocative, effectively establishing the "moving stillness" tone. However, there are minor repetitive artifacts that dull its impact, most notably the near-identical phrasing of "a physical demonstration of her patience." This paraphrase loop is a small but noticeable flaw in an otherwise polished piece, preventing the prose from achieving full momentum and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are moments where the lyricism feels slightly over-determined, and a few phrases lean toward abstraction ("a tune that seemed to come from nowhere and everywhere"). A minor paraphrase loop occurs with the repeated explanation of his "peripherally focused" trait, slightly dulling momentum in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, but the high density of figurative language throughout risks becoming overwriting. Unique phrases are memorable but occasionally draw attention to their own cleverness. The awkward construction "boundary-lessly trapped" is a small but notable blemish on an otherwise strong piece of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative. However, there are noticeable line-level repetitions that a top-tier publication would flag for revision. The phrase "hauntingly practical" is used twice to describe different things, and "crystallized time" also appears twice, which reads as an authorial tic rather than an intentional motif, dulling the precision of the language.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. There are minor instances of repetition that slightly dull momentum, such as the repeated phrase "chronologically confused mind." While the repeated "fractured stillness" is thematically purposeful, its third use feels slightly less impactful than the first two.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and clear, but it leans heavily on recurring abstract phrases like "maze of intentions" and "equations for hope" as a form of conceptual scaffolding. While these phrases support the theme, their repetition dulls momentum and substitutes abstract labels for more concrete, moment-to-moment sensory experience. There are no significant line-level errors, but the information density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and atmospheric, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a noticeable prose artifact—the repetition of "excruciatingly gentle"—mars the otherwise clean execution and feels like a drafting remnant. This loop, along with a slight tendency toward ornate phrasing, slightly dulls the momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and generally clear, but it is hampered by several instances of overwriting and cliché ("whisper secrets of time long past," "layers of deception"). The phrase "thoughtfully clear and deliberate" reads as a self-conscious insertion. There are minor paraphrase loops, such as describing the sundial as both "a key" and "a promise." These artifacts slightly dull the momentum and prevent the line-level craft from achieving the precision required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, and many images are evocative and precise. However, there are instances of conceptual redundancy and scaffolding that slow momentum. For example, "The knots were not random; they were a language, a code waiting to be deciphered" is a paraphrase loop that states the same idea twice. Similarly, the moment of revelation relies on a string of abstract assertions ("a step, a method, a story... woven time itself") rather than a more grounded, concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a controlled, elegant rhythm. Sentences are well-constructed, and the language choices are largely precise. The score is held back from the highest tier by a few moments that rely on slightly familiar phrasing, such as "a testament to the power of being seen," which feels like a cliché in an otherwise fresh piece. The final paragraph, while effective, also has a slightly summary-like quality that explains the final image's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, with strong imagery. However, there are minor but noticeable instances of scaffolding and cliché ("spark of determination," "heart sank"). A few sentences state the internal conflict too directly ("a betrayal of the natural world he sought to restore"), and there's a paraphrase loop in the second paragraph ("a symbol of hope, a bitterly sweet reminder..."), which slightly dulls the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong but suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly slowing the momentum. Sentences like "her movements as fluid as the kelp drifting" and "a flicker of unyielding compassion that refused to be snuffed out" are effective individually but create a cumulative weight. The craft is skilled, but lacks the concision of truly elite prose.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often elegant and imagistic, with strong sensory details. However, it suffers from moments of overwriting and a reliance on abstract, heavily modified nouns like "luminous skeptic" and "defiant hush." These constructions, while atmospheric, sometimes substitute assertion for demonstration. The sentence structure is varied, and the piece is clean, but the density of poetic language occasionally slows momentum rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is lyrical but veers into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes feels decorative rather than propulsive. Sentences are grammatically clean, but there's a reliance on telling ("Her mission was clear") and abstract summary. The story avoids major line-level artifacts, but the lack of concision and the preference for ornate phrasing over concrete action slightly dulls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with high information density in its imagery. Lines like "a place of thundering calm, its glass panes humming with the weight of centuries" are masterful. The score is slightly tempered by occasional scaffolding phrases, such as "With renewed purpose," which summarize a transition rather than dramatizing it with the same specificity seen elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic, but it leans heavily on abstractions ("fragile equilibrium," "incremental absolution," "searing reverie") rather than concrete, sensory details, especially during key emotional moments. While the language is elevated, it occasionally results in telling instead of showing, as when the inscriptions' tone is simply labeled "searing" without the prose embodying that intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but it falters during the story's most important sequence. The process of decoding is described with vague abstractions ("Each thread corresponded to a symbol...represented a moment in time") rather than concrete, propulsive detail. This lack of specificity, combined with minor overwriting and paraphrase loops ("not just a map of emotions but a key to understanding..."), causes the momentum to drag at the story's core.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and readable but leans on familiar phrasing ("promise of something yet unwritten," "cascade of possibility," "breath catching in his throat"). While the sentences are grammatically sound and the rhythm is controlled, there is a lack of line-level surprise or informational density. Some sentences border on summarizing what is already implied, slightly slowing momentum instead of propelling it with fresh, specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but held back by minor, recurring artifacts. Several passages rely on clichés ("simple yet profound," "woven the fabric of humanity") or slight paraphrase loops ("The tune was haunting, a melody that seemed to cloak itself in mystery..."). While the overall quality is high, these moments of imprecision slightly dull the sharpness of an otherwise polished piece, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong word choices ("silent benediction," "testament to fragility") and a well-controlled rhythm. Sentences are varied and paragraphs are structured to guide the reader's focus effectively. The piece avoids significant overwriting, though a few adjacent phrases offer slight conceptual redundancy (e.g., the description of the mask's fragility followed by its symbolism of fracture). Overall, the line-level craft is very strong and supports the story's atmospheric goals without error.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is grammatically clean but lacks propulsion, often summarizing key moments instead of dramatizing them (e.g., "Their exchange was a clash of competing narratives"). It relies on telling rather than showing character states ("abrasive calm," "anger bubbling beneath") and key realizations, which keeps the reader at a distance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but its reliance on dense adjectival phrases ("velvet library," "golden light," "aged parchment," "polished wood") occasionally slows the momentum. This overwriting, while atmospheric, can feel like scaffolding. Some sentences also exhibit a template cadence, particularly in descriptive passages, which slightly dulls the propulsion of an otherwise elegant piece.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often elegant, it is significantly weakened by a critical flaw in a pivotal moment: "Each action felt symbolic, a physical manifestation of her inner transformation." This line explicitly tells the reader the subtext, violating the principle of showing over telling and flattening the story’s artistry at its core turning point.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear but is marred by several clichés ("weathered stool," "heart raced," "trembling hands") that dull its impact. There is some scaffolding and telling, particularly in the final two paragraphs, which summarize Elara's newfound purpose instead of letting the final image carry the weight. For instance, "Her role... had never felt more vital" is a summary that weakens the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose contains many beautiful, evocative phrases ("streetlights daydreamed," "a shard of hush"). However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, approaching overwritten territory where nearly every sentence carries a metaphor, which can dull its impact. Furthermore, the final paragraphs contain some paraphrase loops where the narrative summarizes the meaning of the events just shown, creating a minor drag on momentum at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean but leans on abstractions and shows some redundancy in the conclusion. The final paragraphs circle the same idea multiple times ("a testament to the power of stillness," "a quiet reminder," "Liora had found its purpose"), creating a paraphrase loop that dulls the impact of the ending. This repetition feels like scaffolding left in the final draft.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but occasionally leans on conceptual summary instead of dramatization. Phrases like "The infinite staircase was more than a setting; it was a metaphor for her life" function as authorial scaffolding. This tendency to explain slightly dulls the immediacy, particularly in the thematic summary of the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and largely elegant, with strong sensory details. However, there are moments where momentum is slightly dulled by summarizing pivotal actions rather than rendering them with the same specificity as the setup. Phrases like "She painted furiously" and "Her exhaustion faded, replaced by a sense of purpose" tell the reader about a change rather than allowing them to experience it through concrete, line-level action.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear and functional, but it suffers from moments of telling over showing and summary. Phrases like "a mixture of hope and fear that defined her every waking moment" abstract the character's state rather than grounding it in concrete sensation. The final paragraph summarizes the positive outcome ("spread like wildfire," "families gathered"), which flattens the emotional impact of the climactic scene and reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and concrete imagery. However, a few minor artifacts prevent a top-tier score. The phrase "neatly inventive mind" is repeated, and some constructions are slightly too declarative for this level of publication ("His motivation was clear..."). These are small blemishes on an otherwise strong performance, but they momentarily thin the narrative texture in a story that otherwise excels at showing over telling.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and generally effective, but it occasionally relies on abstract or slightly overwrought phrases like "skeletal reminder of forgotten joys" and "repulsive allure." Some sentences are redundant, such as describing the advisor's voice as an "allure that both repelled and fascinated her." While there are no critical errors, the prose lacks the consistent sharpness and propulsion of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but it sometimes relies on abstract concepts ("cosmic algorithm," "visual counterpart") where concrete imagery would be stronger. There are minor instances of clichéd phrasing, such as the mallet feeling "warm, alive, as if it, too, sensed the importance." While the rhythm is controlled, the piece lacks the high information density and consistent sharpness of exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its world-building. The opening line is excellent. However, a few moments rely on slightly stock phrasing ("her purpose clearer than ever," "her resolve unshaken") that momentarily flatten the line-level craft, preventing the piece from achieving perfect propulsion and specificity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose is clean and generally clear, but suffers from moments of redundancy and abstraction. Sentences like "to rescue truth from a pit of lies, to reclaim what had been buried under layers of deception" are paraphrase loops that slow momentum. The final paragraph, in particular, shifts from concrete scene to abstract summary, sacrificing narrative propulsion for thematic explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there is some minor repetition that slightly dulls its impact, most notably the reuse of the phrase "hushed blaze." While possibly intentional, it feels less like a powerful motif and more like a missed opportunity for a fresh description in the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clear and maintains momentum, but it suffers from a recurring use of thematic labels ("tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") that function as prose artifacts. These phrases are asserted multiple times, creating a slight redundancy that feels more like fulfilling a prompt than organic description. While free of major grammatical errors, the prose lacks the high information density and syntactic variety of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and generally well-controlled, with strong imagery and rhythm. The story loses some points for relying on a few common prose artifacts at key moments, most notably the clichéd phrase "struck him like a wave" to describe the central epiphany. Certain phrases like "luminous torment" and "lover's whisper" feel slightly overwrought, preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of precision.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is hampered by a reliance on abstract jargon and conceptual labels that feel unearned ("intangibly tangible energy," "unfiltered awakening"). These phrases read like scaffolding from a writing prompt and create a slightly overwritten, less immediate texture. The story's momentum is solid, but the line-level craft is weakened by this tendency toward telling over showing key internal states.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and maintains clarity, but often favors telling over showing, particularly regarding Kael’s internal state (“his mind racing”). There is a tendency toward a template cadence, with sequential sentences following a "He [verb]..." structure, which slightly dulls momentum. While generally competent, the line-level craft lacks the propulsion and information density of exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rich with imagery and atmospheric detail, but it is hampered by several line-level artifacts. The use of common similes ("like a physical force," "like a relentless tide") and a moment of intrusive telling ("The metaphor wasn’t lost on him") detracts from the otherwise high quality. The threefold repetition of "sieved hush," while thematically intentional, feels slightly heavy-handed for a piece of this length, creating a minor drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The language is dense and purposeful. There are minor instances of overwriting ("storm-worn windblown") and a tendency towards abstract nouns ("furrowed hush"), but the line-level craft is generally very strong and carries the story's atmospheric weight effectively without significant momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but it is held back by occasional clichés and moments of telling where showing would be more powerful (e.g., "she felt a strange kinship with them"). There is some minor overwriting, where a feeling or idea is presented and then immediately explained. These instances slightly reduce the information density and blunt the momentum of an otherwise gracefully written piece.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, with strong opening imagery and good rhythmic control. However, there are minor instances of overwriting and reliance on stock phrases ("jagged edges of his mind") that slightly dull the overall precision. The final paragraph becomes more abstract and summary-driven, losing the sharp, concrete quality of the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from repetition and abstraction. Phrases like "paradoxically steady" and "cosmic intimacy" are used as thematic signposts rather than emerging from concrete detail. The final paragraph devolves into summary, sacrificing momentum and imagery for explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, in its pursuit of a lyrical quality, it occasionally relies on familiar constructions ("kaleidoscope of what could have been," "slipped away like sand through clenched fists"). These moments, while functional, slightly reduce the information density and freshness in a story otherwise marked by inventive language, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is fluid and grammatically clean, but it sometimes relies on abstract concepts over concrete sensory details. Phrases like "symphony of existence" or summarizing the result of the stitching ("The dimension responded, its light growing brighter") sacrifice immediacy for explanation. While there are no glaring errors, the line-level craft could be sharpened to propel momentum through more vivid, action-oriented descriptions rather than declarative statements of effect.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it leans on abstract phrasing ("timeless dance," "texture of transformation") and risks becoming overwritten in key moments. A significant prose artifact is the delivery of the story’s core message in italics, a device that breaks from the established narrative texture. While there are no glaring grammatical errors or loops, the reliance on high-level abstractions over concrete particulars dulls the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clear and concise, but it is marred by a noticeable prose artifact in the opening paragraph. The run of "Her gaze... Her fingers... Her attention... Her mind..." creates a mechanical, templated cadence that detracts from an otherwise propulsive start. While the rest of the piece is cleaner, this early flaw in rhythm is significant enough to cap the score.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, particularly in the opening descriptions. However, the story resorts to stock phrasing at key moments ("heart pounding," "held its breath"), which lessens the impact of high-pressure beats. The climactic insight is conveyed in declarative, abstract language ("friction itself had disappeared") that lacks the concrete specificity of the story's strongest descriptive passages, creating an uneven texture.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it occasionally slips into overwriting and relies on telling at key moments. The climactic sentence—"Elara felt something rarefy within them"—is an abstraction that dulls the emotional impact. Some figurative language, while fitting the tone, feels slightly worn ("lightning cracking like a whip"), preventing the line-level craft from achieving true distinction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("sunlight splintered through the crystalline walls"). There is a slight tendency towards abstraction, particularly in the final paragraph, which relies on conceptual summaries ("the overture of existence"). This momentarily dilutes the specificity of the scene work but doesn't create significant drag.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often luminous and well-crafted, with strong opening imagery. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrases ("moon cleared the skyline," "watchful eye of the moon") and can become overly abstract, especially in the closing paragraphs which summarize the story's outcome. There's a slight overuse of figurative language that sometimes clouds the concrete action, preventing the prose from achieving the highest level of precision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and clarity. However, a few phrases like "strategically creative mind" and "steely longing" feel like authorial labels rather than embodied character traits. The line explaining the reel's effect ("had not changed her fate but had shown her how to embrace it") verges on thematic summary, slightly dulling the otherwise excellent show-don't-tell execution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, with some lovely phrasing. However, the story leans heavily on telling and summary, particularly in the resolution. The final two paragraphs compress the planting of the seed, the growth of the tree, the arrival of the monsoon, and the confirmation of the memory's safety into a rapid summary. This strategic telling sacrifices the immediacy of a dramatized final scene, making the victory feel reported rather than experienced.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lyrical and generally demonstrates strong craft, with a varied sentence structure that supports the story's rhythm. There are minor instances of familiar phrasing ("weary soul," "secrets waiting to be unraveled") that slightly soften the otherwise sharp imagery. The primary weakness is that the prose defaults to summary in the crucial moment of thematic resolution, a missed opportunity for a purely imagistic landing.

    Prose is dense and musical, largely free of loops or scaffold; occasional elevated diction (“luminous regret,” “vast tapestry of time”) flirts with overwriting but stays within the POV’s reflective register and never muddies the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional poetic layering (“layers of certainty… peeling away like old paint”) is earned and patterned. No loops, no mixed metaphors, no filter-verb stacks. Final paragraph achieves quiet cadence without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid, with varied rhythm and high information density; occasional soft-focus phrases (“meteor hush,” “displaced miracle”) slightly dilute specificity. No loops or scaffold artifacts mar the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional soft fillers (“seemed to pulse,” “for the first time in a long while”) dull peak beats. No loops or mixed metaphors; minor register drift toward abstract “repository” label.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is musical and dense yet clear; sentences advance image or interiority without loops. Occasional stacked modifiers (“emerald and violet”) risk overwriting but stay purposeful. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Strong rhythm; final cadence lingers. One mixed metaphor (“symphony of light and sound that pulsed through her veins”) slightly muddles sensory logic.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“otherworldly,” “converged”) edges purple but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold. Final ticking line lands with cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; only minor filter-verb clusters (“she began to assemble”) and one mixed metaphor (“puzzle she hadn’t known existed”) keep it from the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is muscular yet melodic: “thunderous serenity” is balanced by grounded concrete—“barefoot stargazer…cracked concrete floor.” Density high; lines carry dual load—setting and interior—without padded scaffolding. One faint pattern artifact: repeated sentence stem “And then…” appears three times midsentence but occurs outside peak beat, therefore capped at −0.1 only.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean yet textured: “steam rose like ghosts” does fresh work, not cliché. Information density high—each sentence advances image or stakes. One minor loop: “its destiny tied to hers” closely echoes “her destiny finally unsealed,” but momentum survives. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph cadence slows to crystallize closure without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly concise; figurative language is selective.

Final third remains artifact-free, sustaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lush yet mostly disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“colors bled… swirling like paint in water”) flirt with overwriting but do not stall momentum. Strong sentence variety and sensory economy.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid, with rhythmic variation and purposeful repetition. Occasional soft filler (“she had always been drawn to…”) and abstract nouns (“potential,” “beauty”) dilute density. No mixed metaphors or loops, but a few stock phrases (“swirling tapestry”) slip through.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is fluid yet occasionally drifts into gentle abstraction—“a testament to the enduring power of human emotion”—which softens peak pressure. No loops or scaffold, but figurative layering could be sharper under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and mostly loop-free; occasional soft filler (“seemed to resonate”) slightly dulls immediacy. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Density is high without overcrowding the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“forgotten veil,” “canvas waiting to be filled”) flirts with overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.3)
    Metaphorical layering is controlled; only minor redundancy when fog is twice called “both barrier and bridge.” No scaffold-sentences or filter-verb stacks. Read-aloud rhythm breathes with the ticking gutter cadence, allowing sentence length variation.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold appears (“as if the world held its breath” twice), but it does not stall momentum or cloud closure. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with only minor scaffold (“the hum was not just a sound; it was a call”). Metaphors cohere, and sentence rhythm modulates with Elena’s descent. One paraphrase loop near the stone circle costs a hairline slip.

    Prose is vivid and purposeful; figurative language (“ghostly shroud,” “clockwork mechanism”) is selective and supports atmosphere. Minor scaffold: “her breath visible in the chill air” followed by “her breath steady now” creates a small paraphrase loop. No artifacts in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is textured—“winds reclaim,” “tornado in reverse”—yet leans on stacked modifiers (“unnatural chill,” “eerie resonance”) in high-concern beats. A scaffold sentence (“She had come to honor him, but now she understood”) restates what scene has already shown; that loop dilutes immediacy at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is restrained. Minor scaffold in “soft, golden light” and “shimmering with fragmented images” but no loops or muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean, propulsive lines (every sentence acts) free of cliché loops; selective metaphors (grille as bridge) remain concrete and earned; minor density increase in reflective pools never obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional soft phrases (“as though the arbor itself was holding its breath”) verge on cliché but do not stall momentum. No loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors remain coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic; figurative language is selective. A few near-repetitions (“resonant hush,” “heartbeat of hesitation”) and filter phrases (“she felt”) slightly dull immediacy but do not obscure meaning.

    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers sensory and emotional data without redundancy. No loops or scaffold; “rusted tracks gleezing” is vivid and exact. Rhythm modulates naturally—expansive description narrows to the clipped final image. Figurative language is spare, purposeful, never purple.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose lean and propulsive; each sentence advances motive or tension. One minor filter-verb scaffold (“felt warm against her palm”) preempts deeper risk; otherwise zero loops. Rhythm flexes with stress without muddling closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong sensory compression and vivid metaphors, yet a few decorative phrases and template cadences mar the violin climax; clarity remains intact and read-aloud rhythm varies.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)

One mixed metaphor—“tether to her past, a reminder of the cycle”—but clarity remains intact. No artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; each sentence advances image or intent. Occasional soft fillers—“seemed to come alive,” “felt the weight of its symbolism”—slightly dilute immediacy. No loops or mixed metaphors. Strong verbs (“tugging,” “whispered”) outweigh nominalizations.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold in “she saw herself at different ages” could tighten. No mixed metaphors or loops in peak beats; final paragraph earns its quiet cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Most sentences propel momentum; a few “glistening” and “ethereal” soft spots. No redundant loops, and the rhythm breathes well under closing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is fluid and largely free of loops; sentence variety is good. Figurative language is dense yet coherent, though “meteor hush” edges toward purple. No typos or grammatical slips. One paraphrase loop (“luminous vows” echoed three times in two sentences) slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, high-density, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold detected. Metaphors (“stars whispered secrets in static bursts”) are fresh and coherent. One mixed metaphor—“static bursts that seemed to echo through time itself”—slightly blurs sonic/temporal logic but does not obscure causality. Rhythm modulates naturally with tension.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold appears in “echoes of forgotten phrases” repeated twice, but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Minor overwriting in “weight beyond its fragile shell” and “storm-born silence” nudges it below 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked metaphors (“macerate the stillness,” “stitch together what had been lost”) risk overwriting. Rhythm modulates well; no loops or scaffold. Filter verbs minimal; sensory verbs strong.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective (“mist seeped into her pores”) and avoids purple drift. One mixed metaphor (“foggy lucidity of her thoughts”) barely grazes clarity. High information density; sentences advance stakes or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Scaffold is light, loop count low (minor “ash and forgotten dreams” echo). Rhythm varies—short pins during chant, longer cadences for reverie. Density high; lines perform double duty (image + concept). Occasional elevated flourish that clouds slightly, recovered by strong nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, with strong verbs and varied sentence rhythm. Occasional elevated phrasing (“celestial signal interpreter,” “conceptual repricing”) edges toward register drift but stays within Elara’s arcane vocation. No loops or scaffold; density is high without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and image-dense; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (stalagmites, moonlight shards) are precise and purposeful. One minor filter-verb cluster (“seemed to pulse, seemed to shift”) could tighten, but does not stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.7)
    Clean syntax and atmospheric detail are largely effective; mild paraphrase loops (“fragile voice... forgot to listen”) and thesaurus glimmers flicker without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is largely taut and tactile—“metal groaned”, “fleck seemed to pulse”—yet a paraphrase-loop around “invisible things” recurs twice, dulling impact. The closing sentence reclaims vigor, so the defect slides rather than snaps.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Metaphors (“galaxies in miniature”) are vivid yet controlled. Sentence variety supports the midnight hush and sudden data flares. Clean grammar and pronoun reference.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose pulses: “coalesce, forming words, phrases” mirrors sonic accumulation. Rhythm varies—“quietly articulate… hummed weaving in and out”—breathless when stakes peak. One metaphor run (“jagged teeth… bone towers”) repeats with deliberate escalation; clarity never breaks. Clean copy, no loops.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; occasional “frostbitten hope”-type phrases flirt with abstraction but don’t stall momentum. No loops or scaffold; sensory detail is well-timed. Final paragraph could trim one redundant clause.

    Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence advancing atmosphere or action; minor figurative layering (“kaleidoscope of words”) is purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors; clarity remains intact through the bending-reality climax.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean and propulsive; figurative language is selective and purposeful. One paraphrase loop (“the dream…a fleeting whisper…a cipher of longing”) within first 100 words, but it does not recur. No mixed metaphors. Sentence variety supports cadence shift at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly free of loops. A few near-repetitions (“shadows seemed to breathe… shadows shifted”) dilute impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. Minor scaffold—“she felt a shift, as if the world itself was holding its breath”—could be pruned for sharper propulsion, yet no loops or mixed metaphors mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence layers image, character, and concept. Metaphors are controlled—no mixed vehicles. Rhythm breathes: longer descriptive lulls accelerate into clipped annotation beats. Minor scaffold: “shadow a riddle that defied logic” could trim, but does not stall momentum. No line-level artifacts in closure zone.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.8)
    Purposeful rhythm, strong verbs (“seed shot up,” “waterfall sang”). One near-loop with “wonder” three times but spaced enough to read intentional. No scaffolding; dense information flow. Waterfall diction stays within orchard lexicon; no read-aloud bumps.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally lean and propulsive, but occasional soft filler (“seemed to hum,” “felt like a bridge”) and two near-paraphrase loops slightly dull the peak beats. No mixed metaphors or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“rings of a tree”). One scaffold loop—“she reopened the footage, frame by frame”—is redundant. No mixed metaphors or register drift. Final paragraph leans slightly purple but lands the resonant image.

    Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense; figurative language is selective and pattern-taught. Minor scaffold—“the memory flooded her senses” twice—barely registers. No mixed metaphors or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Final image crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, but occasional stacked modifiers (“gleaming under the hush of borrowed starlight”) flirt with overwriting. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with scene needs. Clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.1)
    Phrase-level sculpting: “sound that bridges the silent world” runs ornate; clarity intact but one metaphor mash瞬産. Sentence rhythm is hypnotic, propelling reflection, yet occasional bloat costs momentum. No near-duplicate lines, no typo.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional poetic layering (“world tilted, but she remained steady”) serves mood. One scaffold loop—“the arrow tip pulsed… the arrow tip flared”—dulls momentum slightly but does not obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is clean and propulsive: verbs like "loomed," "echoing," "amplifying" work double duty as action and metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; figurative language is pattern-taught early and paid off in aurora-charged closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Density high with propulsive cadence—“walls blurring as reality itself unraveled.” Slack appears in retrospective grief rumination; one looped synonym string on “failure” incurs minor drag. Overall read-aloud ear test passes; zero major figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful; occasional elevated phrasing (“mathematics of emotion”) fits the POV’s obsession. No loops or mixed metaphors; momentum maintained. One minor scaffold: “as if he were becoming a vessel” could tighten.

    Prose is lean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“azure defiance”) risks register drift but stays within the lyrical allowance. Final paragraph could trim one sentence to sharpen cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“withheld truth,” “multiverse”) fits the speculative register. One mixed metaphor—“air thickening like a curtain being drawn”—barely grazes clarity.

    Sentences are clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional poetic loops serve the lyric mode rather than stall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is purposeful and never muddles causality. Minor scaffold in “slow drip echoing like a solemn metronome” could be tighter, but it serves cadence. No loops or register drift. Final paragraph lands with crystalline clarity.

    Prose is dense and musical—“shimmering like captured light”—but avoids purple overload; rhythm modulates with tension. One minor loop: “ready to listen, ready to translate, ready to sweeten” could trim, yet it occurs post-closure and does not dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clipped, sensorily dense; rhythm tightens after each crack of ice; metaphors stay grounded (glow “dying embers” granting permission) and never obscure the beat, though “crypt keeper’s key” risks ornamental flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.9)

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is clean, lean, and readable, but the “vibrant hush / thick scent” tandem reappears within paragraphs; small echo loop saps freshness. Otherwise, sentence lengths vary purposefully and no mechanical artifacts mar clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    High density without loop: micro-choices compress legal-memo syntax, leak tension. Rhythm accelerates as beats compress. Metaphor of “archive’s corners” earns its spike. Occasional technical register shifts tolerated under POV competence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clean, with vivid sensory anchors and no loops. Density is good; sentences advance image or motive. Figurative language is restrained; mixed metaphor “ancient eyes” is minor. No artifacts in closure beat. Occasional filler (“she knew what she had to do”) keeps score from 7.5+.

    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; sentences advance story or atmosphere without redundancy. Occasional elevated diction (“untainted by darkness”) fits the elevated stakes. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors. One minor scaffold phrase—“she realized”—could be trimmed, but it does not dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense. One paraphrase loop (“her heart pounding… her voice steady despite the tremor in her chest”) and a mixed metaphor (“bones being reset” alongside emotional warmth) keep it from flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is fluid and read-aloud ready; occasional soft fillers (“seemed to hold”) and one paraphrase loop (“light that did not burn, a light that soothed”) slightly dull the edge, but no artifacts intrude on the closing cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sentence economy is strong: dense sensory imagery (“air alive with secrets”) propels beats without redundancy. A few filter stacks (“she felt a surge…”) dull immediacy at peak moments but never loop. Imagery is purposeful: mist-into-shawl, fragment-into-key. Zero typos; paragraph cuts yield clean visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is fluid and rhythmic; occasional soft fillers (“seemed to,” “as if”) slightly dilute immediacy. No loops or scaffold; figurative language stays coherent. High information density in workshop description; final paragraph avoids explanatory drift.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clear yet rhythmic; scenic detail integrated into action. Occasional generic “gear oil shimmer” or “faded constellation” metaphors slightly dull high-flavor density, but never obscure cause/effect or leakage at closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and propulsive; sensory nouns and strong verbs carry load. One scaffold loop—“he had come here not for the solitude, but for the hunger stone”—could be tighter, and “bleak exhilaration” skirts label-speak, but no artifact obscures the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly lean and sensory, but figurative clusters (“shadowy figure whose voice seemed to emanate from the walls themselves”) verge on purple. No loops or scaffold, yet a few filter-verb stacks dull immediacy. Final paragraph achieves charged poise without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language serves the musical motif. One minor loop—“the orchard… the orchard”—but momentum never stalls. No artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lean and image-rich; no loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Occasional elevated diction (“resurrection,” “archeologist”) is justified by Elias’s reflective turn.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean and propulsive, with strong nouns and verbs. Minor scaffold appears (“her mind racing with possibilities” echoes earlier phrasing), and one mixed metaphor (“restless energy stirred within her—a dappled resolve”) slightly muddles embodiment. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective (“mist clung…lover’s whisper”). No loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous torment”) stays within Kael’s artisanal sensibility. Final paragraph’s cadence shift supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.7)

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean, no loops or scaffold. Occasional filler (“the air smelled of dust and old parchment”) but no figurative muddle. Sentence variety adequate; final paragraph achieves quiet lift without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose carries poetic density without padding; “tiles reflecting the fading sky like a fractured mirror” and “sieved hush” offer strong sonic propulsion. Loops are few—once “guilt” and “sea” risk template repetition—but they never obscure cause or final image. One overwritten clause: “gnawing at him like a relentless tide,” slightly mixed metaphor, yet forgivable under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lyrical yet disciplined: strong verbs (“shrouded,” “untether”), rhythmic variation, and minimal scaffold. Occasional elevated phrasing (“furrowed hush,” “conceptual repricing”) stays within Elara’s reflective register and never muddies causality.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean, rhythmic, and free of loops or scaffold; sentence length modulates. One mixed metaphor “salt-thick air” barely registers. No artifacts in closure beat. Occasional adjectival stacking around regret but does not fog clarity. Reads aloud smoothly.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is elegant, rhythm varied; minimal scaffold and near-zero loops. A few soft abstractions (“forgotten galaxy,” “state of mind”) slightly dilute tactile immediacy. No artifact muddles causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; most lines advance image or emotion. A few soft loops (“moments slipped away like ghosts in the night” echoes “moments that had slipped past her like ghosts”) dull the edge. No mixed metaphors. Final paragraph’s cadence shift is earned. Minor filter-verb clusters (“she realized,” “she saw”) could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and mostly loop-free. One paraphrase loop (“light… golden light”) near the end dulls momentum slightly. Otherwise high density, no mixed metaphors.

    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated phrasing (“insidious,” “cascade of light”) flirts with overwriting but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold. One mixed metaphor—“veil for something far more insidious”—slips by unnoticed in flow.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops, no mixed metaphors. Rhythm modulates with pressure—short clauses during the dust scatter, longer breaths at dawn. One hairline slip: “world seemed to hold its breath” is a minor cliché, not enough to mar closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is dense and poetic; occasional stacked metaphors (“storm’s fury mirrored in…gaze”) slightly overload. No loops or scaffold. Strong verbs and sensory nouns. One paraphrase loop (“each scar a story, and in the telling…”) mild drag. Clean grammar.

    Strong rhythm variety; sentences advance image or motive without scaffold. One paraphrase loop: “not just physically, but as a sanctuary” restates prior clause. Metaphors consistent (light/fracture) and coherent. No filter-verb stacks; prose breathes under 800 words. Clean copy, only minor adjectival padding (“quiet strength,” “sharp mind”).

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; occasional elevated diction (“ethereal breeze,” “kaleidoscope of colors”) edges toward purple but never stalls momentum. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, lyrical without purple drift; sentences vary in length and rhythm, mirroring tidal ebb. Occasional soft phrases (“rhythmically placid melody”) edge toward the generic but do not stall momentum. No loops or mixed metaphors; information density is high for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with concrete propulsion, but paraphrase loop ("decay of the space mirrored the decay she studied... gradual transformation") and three "She had begun to..." sentences trigger template-cadence deduction in mid-section.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density in frost descriptions suffers minor scaffold ("intricate patterns... natural tapestry"), and "drifting resonance" repetition creates synonym churn in the final paragraph, dulling closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "blues for melancholy, greens for hope" demonstrates high-density lyricism. Final line’s "canvas waiting to be filled" recharges winterglass motif without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lyrical density in opening ("breath fogging cracked glass") gives way to climax loops: "glowed," "pulse of light," "ethereal light" recycle imagery without escalation. Filter-verb stacks ("felt a strange connection," "realized") dilute immediacy; overwriting in closure ("water began to part") obscures causal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor synonym loops ("dwindling like embers"/"dying fire"); no closure-dulling artifacts, but "gently persistent" repetition slightly muddies peak-beat propulsion without thematic payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "hands trembled" repeats in opening paragraph, and "breath" recurs excessively ("breathed in... breath slowing... breath steadying"). Otherwise, clean propulsion and vivid texture, but scaffold prevents 8.5+ band despite strong closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Quaking reverie" triggers overwriting penalty (-0.3) with therapy-speak in peak beat; "roots intertwined like ancient whispers" risks mixed metaphor. Otherwise strong propulsion and syntactic variety, but scaffold appears in "her mind drifted to... she had always been haunted by..." (synonym loop). Closure beat remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density ("pried open floorboards, revealing a ladder descending into darkness" compresses action). Minor overwriting in "dancer dodging unseen blades" slightly muddles peak-beat clarity without harming closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal scaffold, though "resonant ache that echoed" has slight synonym churn. Zero closure-touched artifacts; paragraph cuts vary purposefully to mirror emotional cadence during absence collection.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("fingers brushed," "steps steady"), but "luminous disbelief" appears verbatim twice, triggering paraphrase loop (-0.3). Final line’s "thief no longer" avoids sentimentality with precise image charge.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("frayed edges, worn leather a reminder"). Minor overwriting in "thoughtfully spirited precision" but payoff in glass metaphor justifies. Final line’s cadence shift ("cold places could warm") propels closure.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.2)
    Paraphrase loop: "fingers brushing spines" then "traced them with fingertips" in adjacent beats; otherwise clean propulsion with no closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless density but "ambered hush" repetition risks scaffold in mid-beats (e.g., "deepened, became palpable"). No closure artifacts; strategic telling compresses backstory without momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "thoughts unraveling like threads" is sole borderline metaphor. High density ("twilight deepening into surreal glow" advances setting/emotion). Final line’s "echo that would never fade" recharges opening silence without muddle. Slight overwriting in "tapestry" simile.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet clean, but "ambiguously clear" repeats 4x—borderline template cadence in high-pressure beats dulls immediacy without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with minimal scaffolding; only slight redundancy in "cracks not flaws but survival markers" near climax. No loops or register drift, though final paragraph's "paradoxical blend" edges toward overwriting without dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.4)
    Critical filter-verb stacks in climax ("her hands flying," "mind racing") dull immediacy; "icy warmth" repeated as therapy-speak label without embodiment; template cadence undermines pressure in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion with minimal loops, but abstract telling ("profound sense of peace") and stock phrases ("breath caught") dilute embodiment. Final image’s "lingering resonance" avoids muddle, though mid-scene redundancies like "water damage creating images" slightly drag momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with zero scaffold in climax ("she added to it... turning distortion into new pattern"), but "swaying certainties" metaphor recurs with minimal variation in high-pressure beat, triggering mild synonym churn penalty in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-zero loops with high density, but "spectral figures" metaphor borders cliché in climax; "weight lift" closure image slightly over-tells emotion where embodied detail would elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose sings with texture ("regenerative silence that soothed troubled minds"), but "grips reality loosely" is redundant scaffolding. Minor synonym churn ("crumbling peace," "fragile balance") in high-pressure beats dulls immediacy without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion with varied rhythm, but "ridge alive with anticipation/sky darkening" creates mixed metaphor. Paraphrase-loop in "deliberate steps... each note" followed by "hum, a melody that seemed to weave" incurs -0.2. Closure image remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    No loops or scaffold, but "sensitively perceptive" appears twice as near-therapeutic label without concrete embodiment. Final line’s "vibrant symphony" edges toward abstraction, dulling closure’s textural specificity slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.7)
    No paraphrase loops or scaffold, but "symphony of self-discovery" muddles climax with forced metaphor. Information density high, yet "surge of clarity" label dilutes immediacy in peak beat—figurative language overloads high-pressure moment without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with minimal scaffold; "muffled clarity" exemplifies textural precision. Template cadence in rhetorical questions ("What is unseen..."/"Why do we fear...") causes minor momentum drag. Zero closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose exhibits high density and rhythmic variation, though a paraphrase loop appears: "chambers... seemed to echo the passage of time, the way moments expanded and contracted like the chambers of a heart." No figurative muddle in peak beats; final image ("horizon remained, a mirror") resolves with crystalline clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves textural specificity ("ribbon of light," "hollow eyes") with strong propulsion, but minor synonym loops ("pulsed with urgency"/"urgency she couldn’t ignore") and abstract phrasing ("darkening brightness") trigger small deductions. No fatal artifacts, though figurative density risks muddling peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose avoids major loops but "faint rustle of turning seasons" repeats verbatim with minimal pressure; high density in reversal sequence ("melodies distorted yet hauntingly beautiful") fuels momentum without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero closure-dulling artifacts; message tube recurrence avoids synonym churn. Minor loop: "credibly curious" label repeated verbatim during courtyard tension, slightly flattening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "petals preserved in jars like relics" layers meaning efficiently. Minor deduction for slight overuse of "crystal" in shop descriptions, though repetition serves motif cohesion without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "uncoiling like a serpent" slightly overwrites a pivotal beat; no fatal artifacts, yet the simile's familiarity dulls the rope's charge during the critical movement toward the alcove.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with propulsion—"shipwrecks creaked... wooden bones groaning" does triple duty. Minor slips: "weathered and scarred" (redundant after "calloused"), "dormant world" (abstraction). No closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters with a paraphrase loop ("amber grotto at dusk" verbatim in paras 1/5) and near-duplicate "shimmering faintly"/"glowing softly" descriptors; no closure-dulling artifacts, but scaffold in transition beats prevents 8.8+ eligibility per high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold: "breezy library under stars" repeated verbatim; "cycles of compassion" phrase recurs with minimal variation. No fatal loops, but slight density loss in abstract lines like "compassion was a cycle." Final image’s resonance offsets minor cadence hiccups.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves rhythmic control ("sky bled into earth in hues of violet and gold") but suffers paraphrase loops: "luminescent ache" repeats with identical phrasing, and sequential "She" openings create drumbeat rhythm in the search montage, slowing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops; "churned with urgency" shows propulsion. Slight overwriting in "time itself were slipping through her fingers" (redundant), but no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line’s "eternal song" earns poetic payoff without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with zero loops, but final paragraph risks abstraction ("promise of understanding") slightly dulling closure's visceral charge despite strong propulsion elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("methodical" x4 in key beats) and "weight of story half-forgotten" synonym churn. No closure artifacts, but "kindly heart full" edges toward therapy-speak in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise ("edges shimmering with rainwater"), but "thoughts winding like vines" creates a mixed metaphor. Minor scaffold in "her resolve begin to crack... felt lighter" slightly dulls propulsion, though final lines achieve crystalline density without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with "tidal islands rose like ancient sentinels" compressing backstory, but paraphrase loops weaken propulsion: "unending restlessness" followed by "mind buzzing with questions" restates interiority. Final line achieves resonant specificity ("haggard awe of a world reborn"), though two adjacent "she" stems in ruin exploration dull rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold in closure, but paraphrase loops ("shadows cast by unseen forces" → "overlapping shadows") dull momentum in mid-beat; high density otherwise, though generic modifiers ("smooth and iridescent") slightly blur crystal specificity during pivotal touch.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops with high density, but "reactively visionary" label in peak beat triggers minor artifact penalty; propulsion strong though one metaphor ("stirring the air like a wake") slightly strains physical logic without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    No closure artifacts but "trembling certainty" repetition (3x) creates subtle synonym loop; "heart raced... breath caught" adjacent clichés slightly dull momentum. Final image propulsion strong despite minor scaffolding in woods sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor metaphor inconsistency ("unheard symphony" shifts from "faint melody" to "louder" without physical logic) and "entangled memories" as jargon. No scaffold loops or filter-verb stacks; rhythm varies effectively but final line "listened to the unheard symphony" contradicts established term, dulling closure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but overwriting in climax ("prismatic colors twisted into chaotic patterns"); slight metaphor muddle ("shadows deepened, as if the escondite itself was alive"). Final line ("that was enough") rescues momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; "deathly vitality" recharges meaning economically. Final line’s cadence ("balance, honesty, and the courage") propels closure. "Tingling in her mind" borders on abstraction but saved by immediate action ("clutched the pot").

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats ("flood of images and sounds" after subtle hum setup); template cadence in paragraph 2 ("She moved... footsteps soft") dulls immediacy without closure-damaging loops.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean syntax but final-third artifacts ("breath mingling with salt-laden air") risk overwriting; near-repetition ("layering understanding... layering discoveries") creates minor scaffold, disallowing 9+ despite strong momentum and vivid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high density, though minor synonym loop ("faintly... softly" for seashell glow) and "resonant hum" repetition slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beat; no artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    "Hopeful desperation" repeats verbatim early/late, creating a paraphrase loop (-0.2). Otherwise clean propulsion and density; stone chip’s "jagged" detail avoids purple prose. Final line’s "beacon of possibility" earns resonance without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("dawnlit melancholy" repetition) and a scaffold sentence ("The weight of her task pressed on her, but her purposefully curious nature drove her forward") dull momentum. Otherwise, sentence propulsion and specificity ("silvery glow of the stars") support the Accumulative lens without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "her methodical hands disassembling it piece by piece" shows without telling. Minor cadence hiccup in "mosaic of glass and liquid" description, but closure beat ("mist curled around her") avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with concrete propulsion ("boots crunching against frosted floorboards"), but scaffold appears ("her fingers traced... its corners worn"). No closure-impairing artifacts, though "dry-witted" feels generic amid otherwise textured prose.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vivid textural specificity ("vines that had choked the buildings began to retreat") with rhythmic propulsion, but paraphrase loop in "infinitely patient" repetition dulls two high-pressure beats. No closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong rhythm and specificity marred by stock metaphors ("essence of temple's forgotten secrets") and paraphrase loops in memory sequences; final line's "unsravel secrets for generations" slightly overwrites.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with dual-purpose prose ("lattice sustained impossibilities" sets rules/theme). Near-synonym loop ("refuge and curse" → "silence he’d chased") causes mild momentum drag pre-climax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in "her motivation was clear... her elation... was always tempered" creates paraphrase loop; otherwise vivid propulsion with zero figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=6.2)
    Overwriting plagues peak beats: "air was thick with the scent of earth and time, a hauntingly optimistic aura" mixes incompatible metaphors. Final third's "perpetual cycle of creation" is stock phrasing, triggering -1.7 artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor filter-verb stacks ("felt heavy," "realized this was it") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats; otherwise exceptional density with no closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong concrete propulsion ("knelt," "traced," "trembling hands") anchors key beats, but "futuristic nostalgia" label appears twice as therapy-speak abstraction. Template cadence in opening ("Lyra, a pseudonym creator...") slightly dulls immediacy without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong textural density with minimal loops; "conspiracies were like knots" mixed metaphor slightly muddles physics, but final image avoids overwriting with resonant simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with strategic telling; "fierce tenderness" abstract label in climax triggers -0.4; no closure artifacts but "dappled moonlight"/"liquid silver" proximity risks synonym churn, dulling peak-beat immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    Template cadence in para 3 ("The mist seemed... But it did little... The mist swirled") creates loop in high-pressure beat, costing 0.4 per artifact rules. Otherwise stellar: "condensation clung like tears" shows via texture. Final image "ocean still sings" achieves high density without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves rhythmic control ("crumbling walls and twisted trees whispering secrets") with high density, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("faded but its story still vivid"/"stirred something within her") trigger minor momentum drag in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops but "breath catching" cliché and filter verbs ("she noticed") dilute immediacy. Final line’s "threads in the tapestry" achieves high density without muddle, though "heart raced" feels tell-y.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "air" repetition ("air hummed," "air thickened") and filter verbs ("he noticed," "he knew") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; no closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose dazzles with "off-key wind" and "spirals etched into her soul," yet overwriting risks appear in stacked metaphors ("tapestry of sound, each thread of sorrow"); paraphrase loops in "muted tones"/"reef-shadow joy" descriptions dull momentum slightly but avoid closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-zero loops with high propulsion; minor figurative density in "light bloomed... as if extinct feelings awakening" risks muddling but final image ("names etched deeper") maintains clarity and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; high density ("dust motes danced in narrow beams" establishes atmosphere/urgency). "Symphony of truth" risks purple prose but is earned through context. Final line ("they were") has minor grammatical artifact but creates poetic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    No fatal artifacts, but adjacent paraphrase loop ("cracks along the walls... cracks glowing") and abstract "ancient secrets" reduce propulsion. Final image's "weight of achievement" carries slight thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural propulsion until final paragraph’s "symphony of blooming and withering" – mixed metaphor and abstract diction dulls closure’s sensory charge under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.0)
    Minor paraphrase loop with "fractured hush" repetition; "whisper secrets of the skies" metaphor slightly clashes register in high-pressure beat, though final paragraph avoids overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.7)
    "Softly ingenious" repetition (lantern/precision) creates synonym churn in peak beats; "luminous respite" overuse dulls closure impact despite otherwise vivid propulsion and zero scaffold loops.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "shimmered with hues of violet and gold" demonstrates high-density textural specificity. Near-deduction for "cheerful gloom" (slightly stock phrase) but saved by contextual integration. Closure image ("scattered seeds as reminder") avoids sentimentality through concrete charge.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "orchestrated serendipity" repetition and thematic echo in final lines trigger -0.3 loop penalty. No figurative muddle—prose propels smoothly—but redundancy in "serenade monotony" dulls closure impact. Strong ear test; minor artifacts prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops in peak beats; high density where "quill hovering over skin" crystallizes tension. Minor register drift ("spontaneously anchored" feels clinical) slightly dulls immediacy but avoids closure impact per Text-Artifact guard.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lyrical with strong textural specificity, but "noctilucent reckonings" functions as stock jargon in peak beats—elevated diction clashes with glazier POV lexicon, dulling immediacy in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "fractures within him, the parts of his soul he had bargained away" dilutes momentum. Otherwise clean propulsion; final line ("no longer walking it alone") achieves high density without scaffold. No closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion with varied rhythm, but paraphrase loops ("patterns grew more complex, more alive" followed by "searching for the equation") dull immediacy. Final paragraph contains subtle synonym churn ("revitalized," "alight with knowledge"), slightly muddying the closure beat without breaking legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "breathing with whispers" slightly strains metaphor coherence; high density maintained through peak beats without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero closure-adjacent artifacts; final line charges closure ("shimmered one final time"). But near-synonym loops ("perceptively calm," "elusive") and stacked lyricism ("air hummed with promise of renewal... spectrum of colors") risk overwriting in opening beat, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion but "ideals chipped away" and "anchor her ideals" tell rather than show internal conflict. "Flawed beauty" repetition in final paragraph creates paraphrase loop (-0.3). Final line’s "chance for light" risks sentimentality, though celestial motif integration saves it from thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion with varied syntax, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("her mission was not one of charity, but of preservation—a secret she guarded fiercely") and weak modifiers ("faint prints," "sparse at first") reduce density in early beats. No closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero scaffold/loops; "snow falling silently" → "snow resumed its gentle fall" shows purposeful recurrence. Minor overwriting: "her stillness as eloquent as her dance" edges toward stock phrasing. Final line ("hummed with potential for change") risks sentimentality but saved by concrete snow imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Elegant prose marred by synonym loops ("half-lit epiphanies/moments of clarity") and final-third thematic echo ("testament to power of reversal") dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line-level propulsion excels in sensory verbs ("sunlight filtered," "hum of unseen things"), but paraphrase loops ("transiently rooted"/"transient beauty") and elevated diction ("blushing stillness") in high-pressure beats trigger minor scaffold deductions despite otherwise clean rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    Template cadence ("faint at first, but growing clearer") and paraphrase loops ("reverence that bordered on prayer") clutter climax. Final paragraph’s telling ("she understood that her task was not just...") undermines closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lyrical with strong textural specificity, yet high-pressure beats suffer from overwriting ("ethereal grit," "serpents" vines) and repetitive cadence that slightly dulls closure momentum without crossing into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=5.1)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops: "dusky harmony" recurs verbatim 3x; "frugal" appears 4x with near-identical phrasing. Overwritten passages like "thick with dusky harmony, a blend of mystery and anticipation" stack redundant modifiers, while "schematic representations" repeats without advancing action—slowing momentum in critical beats.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops in closure beat; high density ("sanctuary shifted once more, its purpose fulfilled") but "fractured but not beyond repair" slightly clichéd; propulsion flawless despite one weak modifier ("glimmer of hope").

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "glass mountains" simile creates register drift into abstraction during high-pressure beat; no closure-tainting artifacts, though minor overwriting in atmospheric passages.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with dual-purpose prose ("roots entwined with ancient stones" implying struggle), but paraphrase loops ("reclaiming of forgotten spaces"/"nature’s reclaiming") and borderline thematic echo in final paragraph ("even in brokenness, beauty") cap score.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean prose with vivid specificity ("crystalline structure... mirrors that reflected not her image"), but "brightened disquiet" is label-heavy and "simply complicated" feels templated. No artifacts in closure beat, though final line risks sentimentality with "destiny."

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Template cadence in climax ("She recognized... She approached... She plucked") and mixed metaphor in closure ("weight of unlearned wisdom, a symphony"). Strength: Lyrical precision in botanical descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Overwriting in climax beat: dense abstraction ("a state of being... blissfully aberrant") dulls closure image; template cadence ("She followed... She sat...") in thread-reading sequence triggers -0.4 deduction despite strong atmospheric prose elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong textural specificity ("frayed fibers," "brass lamp glow") but "holding weight of centuries" is stock phrase. Template cadence in dual "She knew..." sentences near midpoint. Final paragraph’s "proving... truths could be unraveled" over-explains. No closure artifacts, yet minor synonym churn ("confusion into clarity"/"unraveled with patience") limits high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor loops: "gently luminous glow" repeats 3x with near-identical phrasing, and "humming" recurs 4x without pattern-teaching. Final third contains paraphrase artifacts ("light spreading like a wave... silence enveloped the world"), disallowing 9+ per Q7 rules despite otherwise clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("hands trembling with hope"/"dreams filled with visions") in high-pressure beat risks scaffold, but zero figurative muddle in closure; propulsion remains razor-sharp despite one near-duplicate stem.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Near-zero loops and high density ("brass caliper measured shadow’s blur"), but minor filter-verb stacks ("she noticed," "she pressed") in high-pressure beat dilute immediacy; no figurative muddle near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Chants returned, louder now" exhibits template cadence; minor scaffold in "carefully placed, forming the shape" slightly dulls propulsion, but rhythmic control during fire-spinning ("flames burst to life") elevates peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with rhythmic propulsion, but "seemed to hum" and "felt a shift" filter verbs dull immediacy in high-pressure beats; no loops or scaffold near closure preserves integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops but minor scaffold ("her chest tightening" repeated verbatim); "porcelain limbs stretching" creates micro-contradiction in high-pressure beat; final line ("tasted true silence... set her free") achieves resonant density.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythmically ("Her method was unique—monitoring noise levels..."). High density: "restlessness easing as the gondola continued its serene journey" conveys action, emotion, and setting. Final line crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose shines in sensory specificity ("bioluminescent vines," "crystalline ground") but falters with minor scaffold: "wisely adventurous" tells rather than shows, and "steps guided by faint light/whispers" paraphrases adjacent lines. No closure-impacting artifacts, yet density dips in reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion falters in minor synonym loops (“fading threshold” repeated early) and slight overwriting in the climax (“chorus of resilience”). No closure-dulling artifacts, but density could tighten—e.g., “tendrils of shadow snaking” slightly over-embellishes the encroachment beat.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in machine activation sequence ("Elara activated it, and the pressure began to condense...") slightly dulls propulsion; otherwise high density with vivid, purpose-driven imagery like "towers of time stood beside rivers of memory."

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.4)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "first yawn of evening" opener anchors voice; final line ("walls holding her story") recharges motif; hairline slip in "eloquently silent" slightly generic phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with zero closure-touched artifacts, but "shivering bliss" triggers minor therapy-speak penalty in peak beat; "factually mystical light" risks register drift yet saved by consistent alchemical lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("fractured years ago" compresses backstory). "Dust seemed to shimmer, as if approving" risks sentimentality but avoids overwriting via concrete context. Final line’s cadence ("found her purpose... lives they represented") propels closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean propulsion with purposeful density ("puddles revealed faint outline"), but template cadence in setup ("She was... She had...") and "carefully resourceful" redundancy dull momentum. No closure-beat artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with minimal scaffold, but "threads of silk" simile and stacked metaphors ("dewdrops... glistened like diamonds") in climax beat risk overwriting without pattern payoff, slightly muddling the closure’s emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor overwriting ("perpetual gray, as if heavens dipped in ash") dilutes momentum; otherwise clean propulsion with zero loops in high-stakes monument scene.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffolding ("he knew this was no ordinary artifact; it was a key") and repetitive sentence structures in cavern scene. No fatal loops, but "swirling leaves" motif slightly over-decorated without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion with rhythmic control ("iron walls glistening," "symbols twisting"), but "luminous regret" repetition risks synonym churn; no artifacts dull closure despite minor scaffold in transition phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold, high density ("spectral confession taking shape as a memory"), and no figurative muddle; "hidden sunrise" phrasing risks vagueness but avoids harming closure’s propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "forest seemed to breathe" followed by "forest seemed to respond" dulls momentum in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise clean propulsion—glowing leaf touch delivers clarity without scaffolding—but the redundancy prevents 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high density in peak beats (tower discovery). Minor overwriting risk ("murmurs of the overlooked") avoided by concrete verbs ("pulsed," "traced"), though "eternal instant" phrasing slightly drifts register in high-stakes moments without full pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; final line "cracks always reappeared" crystallizes theme with surgical precision. Figurative language sparse yet potent ("cracks... pulse with life") without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density overall, but final line ("story was just beginning") is cliché, dulling closure. One paraphrase loop ("rustling awakenings" repetition) and "cradling like a cradle" redundancy penalize momentum near end.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.3)
    Filter-verb stack in climax ("she believed... she knew... she needed") dulls immediacy. Paraphrase loop in finale: "reimagined Zahir-7... wounds unhealed. Shard... reminder broken things hold light." Artifacts touch closure, capping score.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Clean propulsion with vivid specificity ("chip shimmering like stolen dawn"), but "discordant echo" borders on cliché and "tinkersong wonder" feels forced. No loops or scaffold; final line’s "melody carried on wind" resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor scaffold ("her steps were deliberate, her satchel bumping") slightly dulls momentum; otherwise, clean propulsion with zero loops—final line’s scent motif recharges prior texture flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.3)
    Paraphrase loops weaken climax: "patterns merging into single image" followed by "map of ideas" restates without added pressure. Final paragraph exhibits overwriting ("storm now distant memory... enriched by wisdom") with template cadence ("She knew... but felt..."). Artifacts in final third (-0.7) disallow 9+ and dull closure's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor synonym churn ("quietly driven"/"quiet drive") and one paraphrase loop ("love, loss, and longing... secrets") in postcard description prevent 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with near-zero loops; "her motivation was clear: to uncover truth in tension" slips into tell-mode. Final image ("glimmer of hope") avoids sentimentality through concrete cost (sinking boots, hours waited).

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless propulsion; minor abstraction ("mind racing") in para 2 avoided stronger embodiment, but final image ("lanterns continued to glow") achieves crystalline resonance without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor overwriting ("gnarled trees heavy with fruit that seemed to hum") and synonym loops ("deliberate steps, mind sharp") dull propulsion; no closure-tainting artifacts but density occasionally overshadows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats ("pulsed with energy, its colors shifting like a living entity") and template cadence in action sequence ("She pressed... the ice began... the archway groaned") dull immediacy. No closure artifacts, but paraphrase loops ("reversing decay that had consumed her world"/"restoring balance") trigger text-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor density issues in high-pressure beat ("strange warmth, as if alive" slightly overwrought) but zero loops/scaffold. Final line’s "spoke volumes" achieves textural specificity without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("patchwork of shimmering fabrics, bore the stains of countless spills" conveys character, history, theme); final line recharges "primal elegance" motif without figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Skeletal remnants" repeated within 5 lines creates paraphrase loop. "Whispers of forgotten dreams/whispers of wind" synonym churn dulls momentum. No artifacts in closure beat, but prevents 9+ per text-artifact rule.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean with strong rhythm, but "suddenly timeless" is label-only description. Minor scaffold ("Intrigued, Elara decided...") dilutes momentum; final line’s "texture of time passing" borders on thematic echo without deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("iridescent hues a gift from a fisherman who claimed it had fallen from the sky") advances multiple elements without muddle; final image’s rhythm crystallizes closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    Repetitive "brazen calm" phrasing in closure beat creates scaffold loops, reducing propulsion. Minor synonym churn ("gently systematic," "deliberate") and filter verbs ("he noticed how") accumulate. Clean grammar but closure image dulled by rhythmic monotony in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Paraphrase loops ("fly amber" repetitions with minimal variation) and template cadence ("her eyes tracing... her boots sinking...") dull momentum in critical beats; strong verbs compensate but density suffers in the 700-word frame.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural specificity but overwriting in high-density beats ("shadows that danced like ghosts across the jetty") triggers -0.4 density penalty. "Narrow vastness" repetition in final third creates paraphrase loop (-0.3), dulling closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong textural specificity ("shattered glass," "faint hum of forgotten machinery") but "glow" repetition ("glow faintly," "glow dimming") creates subtle scaffold; no fatal loops, yet figurative density in high-pressure beats risks overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.7)
    Synonym loops in temporal descriptions ("temporally stretched cosmos"/"temporally stretched expanse") dull momentum. Minor scaffold in abstract phrases like "a vision both beautiful and terrifying" without embodied specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold in abstract emotional labels ("cautious abandon"); strong propulsion otherwise, but "surge of energy" metaphor lacks textural specificity in the critical closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lyrical with strong rhythm, but "whispers" repeat seven times with diminishing returns; minor scaffold in the chessboard description ("object of mystery... nomadic penumbra") slightly dulls momentum without advancing tension.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control ("hours passed, or perhaps only minutes") yet template cadence in setting descriptions ("cobblestone streets," "ancient stone walls") slightly dulls momentum in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lyric density falters in closure beat: "unburdened" is abstract scaffold, "light coalesced into shapes" stacks metaphors. Template cadence ("She pressed on... She realized...") in high-pressure section triggers -0.5 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor closure-beat artifacts: verbatim repetition of "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" and inconsistent verb "quilts memories" (vs. "quilting"). "Sanctuary in a sea of uncertainty" borders cliché, dulling final image—caps below 8.8 per Q7 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor synonym loops ("fleeting dance" then "fleeting existence") and slight overwriting ("testament to meticulous craftsmanship") dilute density. Final paragraph summarizes where scene needed, but no closure-touching artifacts. Rhythm varies effectively—opening cadence mirrors wave patterns, tightening during painting climax.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful cadence shifts (e.g., short sentences during descent), though "screaming tenderness" slightly overwrites in a high-pressure beat, creating a minor register drift that dilutes immediacy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; "patina bronze censer foot" earns specificity without overwriting. Final line’s cadence shift ("one step at a time") recharges "patchwork" motif with propulsion. Minor flaw: "reverse migration" feels slightly thematic rather than organic in early beats, but pays off in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "occlude his control" slightly drifts into academic diction but fits Elias' rationality, and final line’s "some secrets were meant to stay buried" avoids thematic echo through character-particular phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose avoids loops and maintains propulsion, though "gaps" repetition (5x) risks redundancy without escalation. Overwriting edge in "fragile bridge to a story" slightly muddles the boot-print discovery beat, but final line's concrete action ("tucked under his arm") rescues clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops with strong propulsion; "creek’s waters had begun to recede" recharges opening motif. Slight overwriting in "sanctuary of faded parchment and crumbling atlases" borders on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose artifacts in closure beat: "softly commanding" repeats identically 3x, and "fragile beauty" moralizing dulls the final image, triggering -1.7 artifact penalty disallowing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with minimal scaffold, though "calloused yet delicate" redundancy and "scientifically romantic" label approach overwriting thresholds. Final line ("twilight wrapping... like a promise") avoids closure artifacts, but mid-scene jargon slightly dulls momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless density: "feral nostalgia" embodied as "poison seeping into her veins" avoids label-speak. Minor deduction for "jaded wonder" repetition in peak beats, but propulsion remains relentless. Final line’s cadence ("peaks touching sky like fingers brushing eternity") crystallizes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion until "piecing together fragments... puzzle with missing pieces" synonym loop. Filter-verb stack ("she felt... she closed... she understood") dulls the screw-revelation beat (-0.4), disallowing 9+ despite otherwise vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose achieves lyrical precision with zero scaffold or loops; "crystallizing like frost" exemplifies high-density imagery, though "symbol of her newfound calm" risks thematic echo without sufficient prior tension.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    Filter-verb stack ("felt the urgency," "felt the currents," "felt her grandmother’s presence") in high-pressure beat dulls immediacy. Otherwise strong propulsion, but metaphor density ("ghostly flower," "fragmented image") risks overwriting in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.7)
    "Seemed to pulse," "seemed to shimmer" filter-verb stacks dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Template cadence ("As they walked... As the final illusion dissolved...") creates repetitive stems, though lyrical density partially offsets scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean propulsion with purposeful compression, but "razor edges" metaphor muddles logic (edges don't cut). "Landscape of endless possibility" overwriting dulls final image impact (-0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats but minor paraphrase loop ("delicate balance"/"fragile balance"); lyrical density peaks cleanly in closure without muddle despite stacked metaphors ("river," "dam," "rain").

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor cliché ("loneliness gnawed like damp air") and one synonym loop ("faint grooves that seemed to shimmer... shimmer when held"). No closure artifacts; final line’s "glass disc humming softly" avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.5)
    Minor scaffold ("her movements deliberate, as if..."; "thoughts drifted") and synonym churn ("weight of small moments" x3), but no artifacts dull closure. "Hum with untold stories" cliché slightly muddles density.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("air thick with... footsteps echoed") and generic descriptors ("smooth and otherworldly"). Avoids fatal artifacts but "relentless in its growth" cliché dulls closure beat. High density otherwise.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops with high density ("ultrasonic hum faltered, replaced by musical notes"), but "strange yet profound" and "quiet blaze" approach scaffold phrasing. Final image avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Paraphrase loop in para 3 ("confidently uncertain—that’s how she’d always described herself. It was a paradox...") dulls immediacy; otherwise strong propulsion and specificity, but artifact caps high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose lyrical yet precise ("prisms on the water," "tapestry of emotion"), but near-purple phrasing ("shadow woven from starlight") risks overwriting; no closure-dulling loops, though "symphony" metaphor strains slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.3)
    Template cadence in clue sequence ("In one chamber... In a secluded chamber") creates paraphrase loops, while elevated diction ("volcanic tenderness") slightly clashes with POV lexicon. No closure damage but lacks zero-loop propulsion for 8.5+; density suffers from adjacent restatements.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "entangled memories" repetition (4x in 3 paras) creates synonym churn. Final paragraph's template cadence ("As she walked... the drumming...") dulls closure image despite strong opening imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    No loops or scaffold near closure; final line’s rhythm ("quietest voices resonate") delivers propulsion. Minor synonym risk: "felt warm... almost alive" then "key felt heavy," but offset by purposeful density. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor scaffold in "pebbles into a stream" and synonym loops ("unobtrusive/shadows," "calm/demeanor"). Dental mirror descriptions avoid purple prose, but "spiralingly calm" repetition triggers paraphrase penalty (-0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.1)
    Template cadence ("as he...") creates drumbeat rhythm in high-pressure beats; scaffold phrases like "a sense of amplified quiet permeated" dilute momentum without payoff, but final image retains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with minimal scaffolding; "calloused hands... belied her grace" shows not tells. Minor abstraction in "combative tenderness" phrase (line 48) slightly dulls closure image. No loops or cadence errors.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsion until final paragraph where "pulsed faintly"/"unyielding" cadence shift slightly overwrites; minor paraphrase loop ("emotional void she inhabited... void she had mastered") triggers -0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical density ("cobalt atrium," "humming quartz") enhances texture without muddling closure. Minor overwriting in climax ("suspended in air as if held by invisible hands") risks momentum but payoff justifies it. Flawless cadence modulation.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor synonym loops ("awakenings"/"awakened") and elevated diction risks purple prose but stays voice-motivated. Zero closure-tainting artifacts; "vibrant life in monochrome" shows textural specificity without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought ("symphony of whispers, each fragment a story waiting to be told") in high-pressure beats, risking momentum. Zero loops or scaffold, yet "faintly luminous"/"glow with life" proximity hints at minor synonym churn. Final line’s "energy of renewal" avoids sentimentality through concrete lab imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Paraphrase loop in closure beat ("renewed determination... confidence... words felt like promise") dulls final image; strong opening lines undermined by scaffold in pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose flows with textural specificity ("rain-tapped Morse code," "labyrinth of numbers"), yet paraphrase loop in "steadily curious" trait description dulls momentum; closure image ("map its ascent") resonates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Density overload with "atoms of nostalgia" (4 repetitions in 200 words) and "steadily unpredictable" as label-only trait; "liquid gold" metaphor slightly muddles the climactic beat despite rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.1)
    Filter-verb stack ("breath fogging," "gazed") and therapy-speak ("mind buzzing") in opening create scaffold, but no closure-tainting artifacts. High density overall, yet paraphrase loops like "fragments of memories she couldn’t piece together" dull immediacy in early beats.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "hushed thunder" and "echoes of forgotten emotions" showcase rhythmic control and textural specificity, though "pulsed with quiet energy" edges toward generic phrasing in one high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    No prose artifacts or loops; lyrical density serves momentum. "Shards of glass that glimmered like captured starlight" exemplifies purposeful specificity. Final line’s "shadowed rapture of the stars" avoids cliché with resonant closure charge, satisfying 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero loops in closure beat, but "Mara felt... Mara realized..." template cadence in mid-scene dulls immediacy. High density otherwise; final line’s "charm warm... clock ticking" avoids overwriting while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level propulsion excels ("hum of insight became a roar"), but minor scaffold appears: "disoriented but alive with curiosity" redundantly echoes prior disorientation. Zero loops in peak beats; final image’s "bathed in the machine’s light" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed ticket edges" shows instead of tells. Slight overwriting in "twilight draped the veiled ridgeway" risks decorative density, but closure beat remains clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("whispers of those who had come before, of those who had tried") with clear propulsion, but "frostbitten hope" triggers minor overwriting in the climax beat, slightly muddling emotional specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    No fatal artifacts, but "constellations shifted" repeats with minor variation (paraphrase loop), and "stones humming" borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats; propulsion remains strong despite rhythmic hiccups.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong rhythm and specificity overall, but "periodically eternal" functions as therapy-speak in peak beat, violating POV lexicon and muddling closure. No loops or scaffold, yet this artifact in final third disallows 9+ and slightly dulls the CR’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.0)
    Minor scaffold in "Lira’s motivation was clear: to discover meaning..." weakens propulsion. Template cadence in stone circle sequence ("kneeled... pressed... felt") costs density, but final line's "margin of daylight" resonance saves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "steam rose like ghosts" and "roar" create purposeful cadence shifts. Final line’s "beacon" crystallizes closure without muddle. Minor slip: "mind humming" edges toward generic abstraction mid-tension.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong textural specificity (crumpled photo, loose stone) but adjacent paraphrase loops ("fragility of life"/"world that had shattered"). Template cadence in cliff scene ("She took... Her eyes fixed...") triggers -0.6 artifact penalty. No closure-beat muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "shards of shattered mirror" metaphor integrates cleanly. Minor register drift in "luminescent ache" risks therapy-speak but avoids penalty through embodied context (chest pulse guiding hands).

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffolding ("anger burned deep within her" tells rather than shows); final paragraph's "testament to power" slightly overwrites, dulling the earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.9)
    Zero loops but "dizzying quiet" repetition (4x) and final abstract moralizing create scaffold; high density in network sequence with concrete verbs ("copied," "flickering"), yet "world would never be the same" dulls closure image per text-artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Her mission was clear: to weave continuity through chaos" is tell-not-show scaffolding; "heart tightened" is cliché, but final image ("tranquil blaze") achieves high density without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Transliterated" repeated 3x like scaffold (-0.3). Otherwise, zero loops: "rail spike" descriptions evolve purposefully. Final line’s "zigzag across the sky" recharges motif with propulsion. No figurative muddle in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor scaffold in "orbits of regret" repetition and "solemn playfulness" summary; strong propulsion otherwise, though pen nib's physicality could deepen sensory texture in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic control soars in "labyrinth of glass chambers," though "doomed from the moment it brushed against the sticky resin" suffers template cadence with three prepositional phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong textural specificity but overwriting in high-pressure beats: "lilac unease" borders on decorative labeling, and "connection across time and space" dilutes immediacy. Template cadence ("She interjected...") in mid-beat slightly dulls closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Retrocognitively trapped" label repeats without variation; "warm and cold" → "gentle and unyielding" creates synonym churn. No closure-impacting loops but minor density issues prevent 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold—every line advances atmosphere or character ("petals unfurling like secrets" compresses time and emotion). Figurative language serves pressure: "shadows deeper" mirrors emotional shift without muddle. Final line ("rising nostalgia wash over her") recharges the motif cleanly, avoiding overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold in closure beat ("she intended to be part of it") slightly dulls propulsion; otherwise high density with purposeful texture, though "fractally precise" repetition verges on template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor syntactic loops ("her work," "she began") but no scaffold. "Factually mystical" is therapy-speak label; final cliché "journey... only just begun" weakens propulsion. Figurative language sparse but clean. Register drift in peak beats prevents 8.0+.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    Two paraphrase loops ("quietly inspired, her focus unbroken" followed by "time felt fluid") slightly dull momentum, but no artifacts in the closure beat. High density and concrete propulsion elevate it, though synonym churn ("unscramble," "unravels") prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong specificity but "therapy-speak" in climax ("realized fixing what's broken was not about erasing the past") triggers -0.6 penalty for diagnostic label-speak in peak beat, dulling closure's emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion and density ("rain gutters ticking" as time metronome), but minor scaffold in opening: "scanning horizon as if part fog" followed by "senses percolating like roots" creates subtle redundancy. Avoids fatal loops yet loses hairline precision in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Thrum repetition ("thrummed softly," "grew louder," "thrummed louder") creates paraphrase loop in high-pressure beats. Otherwise vivid, purposeful prose with strong textural specificity anchoring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose excels in texture ("waters reflecting soft glow of lanterns"), but adjacent synonym loops ("quivering hush" x3) and filter verbs ("she noticed," "she felt") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy, narrowly avoiding artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Brittle" repetition (4x) creates paraphrase loops in high-pressure beats, dulling momentum; otherwise strong propulsion and concrete verbs ("sundial clutched tightly," "shelves rearranging") anchor the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "keeper of secrets" repetitions slightly dulls closure impact; otherwise strong propulsion and sensory precision anchor the lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-zero artifacts with strong propulsion ("air vibrated faintly"), but adjacent scaffold in opening: "air thick with hum... walls lined with vintage microphones" restates atmosphere without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion until final paragraph where filter-verb stack ("she realized... her heart pounding... she reached") dulls immediacy; "pulse in her veins" cliché mars high-pressure beat but closure image ("needle pointed toward stars") remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("mist clung... ghostly shroud" compresses setting/emotion). Final line’s rhythm ("one stroke at a time") shows propulsion. Minor overwriting in "emotional landscapes" but payoff earned through portrait’s physicality. Closure image crystal clear with no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold ("she questioned the logic of it all") and mixed texture metaphor ("spongey dread coiling"); no closure-dulling artifacts but slight momentum drag in mid-beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong textural specificity ("wet-plate collodion glass flake") but suffers from paraphrase loops: "pixelated amnesty" is reiterated without deepening, and "luminous disbelief" appears twice within 50 words. Final paragraph’s "melody of possibility" risks sentimentality, dulling closure’s conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in sensory descriptions ("dusty interior filled with remnants... tattered costumes, broken props") creates synonym churn. Final paragraph’s lyrical compression avoids overwriting but "invisible thread" metaphor slightly strains the grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural specificity ("daylily-pressed telegram") but paraphrase loop in paragraph 4 ("heal with words...mending others...healing herself") dulls climax. Filter-verb stack ("letting the words...flow through her") narrowly avoids -0.5 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold—"flesh-eating plant grew rapidly" merges action and consequence—but "frozen confession" recurs 3× with near-synonym churn ("thaw within her," "words rising"). Final line’s "quiet resolve" slightly overwrites the earned image; minor lexical drift from "warlike serenity" to "resolve" dulls closure’s specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Anxious elation" paraphrase loop (3x) dulls high-pressure beats. Strong verbs offset nominalizations, but "shimmered with otherworldly hue" strains physical logic. Final image’s propulsion compensates for minor scaffold in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops/scaffold; "boots crunching on fallen petals" does triple duty (sound/action/setting). Final line’s "wove meaning into the very fabric" charges closure without overwriting. Opening/final lines anchor perfectly; no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops in climax, but "thought of the nights on stage" summarizes where scene could deepen; final line's near-sentimentality ("purpose, after the applause") is redeemed by concrete cloth motif anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold loops ("her hands moved... her mind piecing" followed by "methodical nature urged") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") dull momentum. Final line lacks propulsion, but no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but two paraphrase loops ("Her work was meticulous... driven by motivation," "truth was not singular but a tapestry") dull immediacy in mid-beat without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=5.1)
    Severe overwriting: 80% of high-pressure chamber beat uses stacked metaphors ("mosaic of crystals refracted light into a thousand colors"). Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she sensed") dull immediacy. Template cadence ("As she..., the...") triggers -0.6 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with propulsion: "rusted tracks gleezing" avoids scaffold. Minor overwriting in "cathedral of decay" and one synonym loop ("recklessness and precision"/"daringly methodical") in peak beats. Final line’s "first steps" avoids closure muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion and density, but verbatim repetition of "cautious exuberance" (opening/closing) creates paraphrase loop in peak beats, preventing 9.0 despite exceptional textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density in climax ("vines snaked... scouts froze"), but scaffold weakens momentum: "her mind alight with questions" redundantly echoes prior plant telepathy. No figurative muddle in peak beats preserves propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“infusing the traveler’s features with a lifelike glow”) with clear propulsion; no figurative muddle even in peak beats like the chip’s activation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor synonym churn ("quiet unrest lingered... yearning she couldn’t name") and a near-duplicate phrase ("world felt smaller, the noise of her thoughts quieter") dilute momentum. Final paragraph’s cadence shift ("beauty more vivid... felt whole") showcases masterful propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor scaffold: "turning it in his hands, and felt the weight" uses filter verbs. "Sincerely insincere" is label-speak in peak beat. Template cadence in chime description ("seemed random but felt deliberate") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero prose loops, but "heart heavy but unburdened" introduces mild abstraction in closure beat; otherwise, lyrical precision ("sycamore hush," ripple patterns) sustains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density but final paragraph suffers paraphrase loop: "not movement... not answers" repeats thematic abstraction. No figurative muddle, but redundancy dulls closure charge. Momentum loss in reflection-heavy climax.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with clear propulsion, but mid-beat scaffold ("His motivation was clear...") tells where showing would strengthen. "Brilliance dimness" repetition risks muddle, though final line achieves textural specificity without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor figurative muddle in peak beats: "luminous vow" strains metaphor logic, and near-closure sentimentality ("felt like a promise") risks clarity. Otherwise strong rhythm and zero loops, but artifacts touch closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold ("her movements deliberate as she prepared") and slight logic strain ("deafening and silent" static burst) mar otherwise propulsive prose. Final line’s "ambered expanse" delivers crystalline closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "parchment, now heavy with the stories" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("crystallizing into solid, translucent beings") avoids muddle in peak beats while varying sentence rhythm supports scene urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.7)
    "He closed his eyes, focusing on the dripping rates, feeling the rhythm seep into his veins" exhibits scaffold loops; "plausible impossibility" diction clashes with mage’s lexicon, dulling propulsion in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.3)
    No closure artifacts, but middle-section density suffers: "vivid color...vivid memory" repetition, "mirrored hush" overuse. Final paragraph's "beacon, promise...smiled" cadence feels mechanical. Strong propulsion otherwise, with concrete verbs ("sank," "prick," "resurface").

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong density in orchard descriptions, but paraphrase loops ("air hummed with the touch of wonder" / "orchard seemed to hold its breath") and closure overwriting ("weaver of wonder, keeper of balance") trigger minor artifact deductions. No filter-verb stacks.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.8)
    Figurative muddle in peak beats: "clouds below seemed to shift, forming shapes that mirrored the seeker’s thoughts" violates physical logic; paraphrase loops ("remembering through muscle memory" x2) dilute momentum near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong rhythmic propulsion in climax ("Each strike of the swords was a question"), but adjacent paraphrase loops ("a dance of complementary opposites," "battle of self against self") slightly dull momentum without payoff in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong rhythmic control ("brook murmured softly, its flow steady and hypnotic") with zero scaffold loops, though "storm-born silence" repetition risks thematic echo. Minor register drift ("orthogonal approaches") clashes with proprietor's lexicon in high-stakes beats.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold loops; "off-key wind" motif drives propulsion. Minor register drift in "conceptual repricing" abstraction during high-pressure beat slightly dulls closure image, costing 0.1 from potential 8.7.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Foggy lucidity" abstraction disrupts momentum in a high-pressure beat; minor scaffold ("she felt the weight... pressing upon her") slightly dulls closure’s cost legibility despite otherwise clean propulsion and sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but scaffolding weakens climax ("Elara was stoically sensitive..."); near-duplicate phrasing ("fragile yet insistent"/"crystallized yet unyielding") in pivotal beats reduces density without pattern payoff, slightly dulling closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves high density with rhythmic propulsion ("skeletal fingers... holding its breath"), but "faintly... faintly" synonym loop in para 2 dulls immediacy. Final image avoids overwriting while crystallizing closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Negligible scaffold; "resiliently positive" is the sole near-label in peak beats. Sentence rhythm accelerates during rift entry ("world dissolved into kaleidoscope"), but "air shimmered with otherworldly glow" slightly overwrites. Zero loops in closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor scaffold loop in "memories alter, so too did the gallery" slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise flawless density—"roots coiled upward like living vines" integrates action and setting without ornament.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Balancedly curious" is clinical diction in peak beats; minor paraphrase loops ("wonder, but also uncertainty" / "fear was a poor compass") dull immediacy without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Text-artifact penalty (-0.7): paraphrase loops ("mist swirled... mist thickened... mist seemed to part") and template cadence ("She knew... She wondered... She studied"). Overwriting in closure ("silent companion in her ongoing quest") obscures conceptual cost. Final beat lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong rhythm variation and propulsion, though minor paraphrase loops exist ("crumbling walls" repeated closely) and "fleck" overuse slightly dulls density in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Her heartbeat quickened, a rhythm she counted constantly" introduces trait without immediate functional consequence; minor scaffold in peak beats dilutes momentum despite otherwise crystalline prose in closure unit.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose generally propulsive with strong verbs ("jagged teeth," "coalesce"), but paraphrase loop in final third ("closed her eyes, letting sounds wash over her. She was searching for a pattern") dulls momentum. Final image’s clarity survives, but scaffold prevents 9+ eligibility per artifact cap.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero scaffold or loops; every sentence propels momentum. "Frostbitten hope" recurrence gains meaning through context shifts. Minor register drift with "gravitationally playful" in high-pressure beats, but closure lines ("warm from inside out") achieve crystalline resonance without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("violin carved from fallen star hummed... breathe life into air" fuses setting/theme). Final line recharges locust shell motif with propulsion. No figurative muddle—cadence shifts organically from "delicate thread" to "music swelled."

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in bottle description ("swirling like a tempest trapped in amber" → later "internal tempest"); no fatal loops, but "thunderstorm in a bottle" repetition slightly dulls momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor density issue: "faint echo of laughter long since faded" and "faded murals" create subtle synonym loop. Otherwise exemplary propulsion—"pocketed the fragment, its warmth seeping" merges action/image. No closure-dulling artifacts; final line recharges "whispering gleam" with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "kaleidoscope of words and images" compresses transformation without muddle. Final line "one book at a time" recharges scarf motif with precision. Minor deduction: "gave way to something sweeter" risks slight cadence template in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose lush but climax beat suffers figurative muddle ("light danced in swirls and eddies" mixes incompatible physics). Template cadence ("She [verb], her [noun] [verb]-ing") in paragraph 4 dulls immediacy, though final image’s specificity ("colors still glowing softly") salvages propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.1)
    Overwriting muddles key beats: "fragile thread of hope stretched across the hush of cosmic possibility" mixes metaphors. Template cadence ("She stepped... The shadows shifted... Her goal...") dulls the vault approach. Final line’s "unchanged, yet everything felt different" is redundant despite poetic intent.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor cliché ("heart pounding with anticipation") and filter verbs ("she noticed") mar otherwise precise prose. No loops in closure beat; strong textural specificity in "timber beams groaning."

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-zero scaffolding; "crescent moon" leaf tracing does triple duty (character, setting, stakes). Minor paraphrase loop ("silence both haunting and serene... silence no longer empty") costs 0.4 but avoids closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but "radiant hush" loops (4 repetitions) dull momentum; "color of wonder" is therapy-speak in peak beats. Final image avoids closure-dulling artifacts, though synonym churn ("weaver," "guardian," "keeper") slightly muddies propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with strong propulsion, but "lucid unrest" and triple "accumulated silence" create minor abstraction loops in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Overwriting in climax: "ancient and preserved by the very silence she sought to interpret" muddles causality. Template cadence ("Her tools were simple, but her mind was sharp") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "synthetic snow swirl" and "frayed ropes" demonstrate textural specificity. Propulsion accelerates seamlessly into closure ("placed it carefully on the floor"). Minor register drift in "physics of letting go" slightly jars but doesn't obscure cost.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion and textural specificity ("luminous figure, both ethereal and solid"), but "tinkersong wonder" repetition and stacked modifiers ("faint glow of distant lightning") create minor density issues. No loops dull closure, though "fragmented consciousness" slightly echoes "fragmented thoughts."

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    No loops or scaffold, but "scattered light" overuse (5x) without payoff creates decorative redundancy. "Otherworldly glow" edges toward purple prose yet avoids muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("quietly explosive, a fusion of precision and passion") edges toward thematic redundancy, but no closure-dulling loops; propulsion remains clean with concrete verbs ("sketched," "leapt") outweighing lyrical flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("fractally precise detail" x2) in high-pressure beat; otherwise impeccable propulsion, but "beauty in endings" overwriting dulls closure's conceptual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    Paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("frayed but potent" → "frayed but its words still potent"). Strong propulsion otherwise; "amber twilight" opening anchors voice. Final line's compass rose payoff justifies density.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("fingers brushed," "gears hummed"), but paraphrase loops dilute impact: "potential waiting to be unlocked" followed by "began to piece together." Final image avoids muddle, though "soft hush" overuse risks lyric redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Brambled hope" appears 3x with inconsistent metaphor (brambles ≠ weaving threads), causing minor figurative muddle. "Her hope brambling through their efforts like a thread" mixes vehicles, slightly dulling closure beat. Otherwise clean propulsion and sensory economy.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "doubt crept in" is near-label abstraction in high-pressure beat; otherwise high density with concrete verbs ("shuddering," "trembled") charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("boots crunching on gravel" conveys urgency) with precise verbs. Final line’s "something had changed" recharges the nut motif without muddle, passing the text-artifact screen.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in reflection paragraph ("For years... Now, as pieces fall") and slight register drift in "symphonically attuned" dilute momentum; otherwise, high density with purposeful lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym loops ("glow" x3 in climax beats) and overwriting ("eternal and ever-changing") dull closure propulsion; high density otherwise, but artifacts prevent 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Sturdy brittle" is mixed metaphor; "frosted with ice, glowing faintly" has redundant modifiers. Near-closure tells ("her work complete") rather than shows. No loops, but minor figurative muddle in high-pressure beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose soars in "cobblestones whispered tales" concrete specificity, but adjacent sentences like "The night deepened... energy did not wane" create paraphrase loops; "rehabilitated more than a clock" borders on thematic boilerplate in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong rhythm and specificity marred by adjacent figurative loops ("memories entangled like vines," "shadows danced like ancient spirits") and near-duplicate phrasing ("fractured relic" / "scattered remnants"), slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Template cadence in mid-section ("Elara... stood... Elara’s motivation... Elara had studied") creates rhythmic monotony. Filter verbs ("she knew," "was fixated") dull immediacy during high-pressure beats. No closure artifacts, but scaffolded phrasing impedes momentum in development beats. Text-artifact penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold ("not about creating noise but about uncovering") and mixed metaphor ("sunlight like whispered secrets") in early beats; density remains high but artifacts prevent 8.5+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in "recall the day she was exiled" summary loop; high density otherwise, though "hues of indigo and amber" borders purple prose—no closure artifacts but cadence stutters at reflection beat.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion; single mixed metaphor ("shadows danced like old friends" vs. earlier deepening shadows) causes minor coherence dip but doesn’t dull closure. Zero loops.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in opening ("calloused from years... moved with precision" repeats later). "Dappled sunlight"/"silvery glow" verge on cliché, but corpse flower’s scent description ("earthy aroma resonating deep within her chest") shows precise textural propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffolding ("mission was clear... she knew she was close") and generic phrasing ("heart raced") prevent 9.0. No closure-dulling artifacts, but overwriting in "delicate balance between life and chaos" slightly muddles final charge.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely clean with strong textural specificity ("rusted edges catching moon glow"), but scaffold phrasing ("rapidly adapting mind had already begun piecing") creates subtle redundancy. Final line’s resonance avoids overwriting, though abstract terms like "fragility" slightly dilute momentum in closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong textural specificity ("mosaic of fractured ice") but paraphrase loops in cavern description ("crystalline walls... sculpted hush") create scaffold; no closure-dulling artifacts despite slight overwriting in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with purposeful rhythm, but paraphrase loop ("determination never wavered, even as fatigue crept") dulls momentum; no artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops; metaphors serve pressure ("labyrinth of mirrors" during overwhelm). "Stars began to fade... but Elias remained" shows textural specificity. Final line crystallizes theme without abstraction. Minor deduction for "mathematics of emotion" (slightly academic), but context justifies it.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with propulsion ("breath visible," "hum intensifying") but simultaneity error: "ridgeway seemed to shift... aurora pulsing" blurs cause/effect in pivotal beat, dulling closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid but contains minor paraphrase loops ("faintly... faintly... faint resonance") and redundant telling ("not just an object... vessel, conduit"). No closure-dulling artifacts, yet slight scaffold in opening reduces propulsion under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion and specificity ("amber bead stoically sparkling"), but "raveling silence" overuse creates paraphrase loops (4x). Final line's "tapestry of time" slightly dilutes momentum, though no artifacts touch closure beat; density remains high through tactile details.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold, with strong propulsion in descent sequence. However, "shimmering like liquid light" overwrites the silk's introduction, and "jagged teeth" simile later creates mild metaphor dissonance in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "air thickening like a curtain" avoids purple prose. Minor overwriting in "symphony of whispers and rustles that seemed to call her name" slightly dulls momentum, but final line’s active verbs ("weave," "protect," "uncover") rescue propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero scaffolding loops; "sea glass felt warmer" crystallizes closure with textural specificity. Slight overwriting in "luminescent ache" but no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; high density ("shaping the past into the future with every turn") with propulsion. One overwriting risk: "laughter carried an edge of shadowed elation" uses label-speak, but redeemed within 3 lines by embodied action (peering at fog). Final line’s cadence shift ("more storms to laugh at...") crystallizes momentum without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("whispers fading"/"voice soft"); strategic telling compresses backstory but "churning with questions" slightly overwrites. No closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "mundane miracles unfolding" avoids purple prose. Final line "beacon of what trees witness" charges closure with high density. Syntactic variety ("The sextant wasn't just broken; it was a vessel...") propels momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "fracturing into shards of light" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor synonym churn ("dormant"/"dulled by neglect") avoids penalty, but "bound release" creates slight figurative muddle in peak beat. Closure image ("hands steady, purpose fulfilled") recharges mica motif with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose flows with strong rhythm and specificity ("crumpled invitation," "flickering candlelight"), but "enlarged tranquility" borders on thematic abstraction in peak beats, slightly muddling the closure’s emotional texture. No scaffold loops or cadence errors, yet the elevated diction in "unearth wisdom in a mistake" dilutes immediacy without payoff in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose lush but "tenuous absolution" and "heuristically gentle" disrupt lexicon; minor scaffold in reflection blocks ("palace’s history" paragraph) slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold/loops with high density ("breath misted as she worked, fingers gloved to protect slides"); "luminous vows" motif evolves without muddle, though "scientific and reverent" slightly overwrites in measurement scene.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops and strong propulsion until "symbol" dialogue line, where slightly elevated diction clashes with Lila’s established lexicon, dulling peak-beat immediacy by 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density with purposeful rhythm ("ribbons of green and violet," "metallic tang... sweetness"), but "terrestrially cosmic spectacle" in para 1 triggers overwriting penalty (-0.4) via mixed metaphor violating physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal scaffold but "mechanical repetition of what others wanted" borders on generic abstraction; final image ("woman emerging from shadows") avoids figurative muddle while sustaining propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor artifact: "faint hum of energy, as if the plate itself remembered its purpose" strains physical logic; mild synonym churn ("trembled slightly"/"trembling hands") slightly dulls propulsion in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    Paraphrase loop in climax ("light fracturing into a thousand shimmering fragments... clouds seemed to part") dulls closure image; "muted vigor" repetition creates scaffold. Strong propulsion otherwise, but artifacts in final third disallow 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "smooth yet etched with faint lines mimicking human age" slightly dilutes momentum; zero loops in climax, but "static that whispered" risks metaphor muddle without harming closure’s elegant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.5)
    "Sandstorm calm" creates a mixed metaphor in the climax beat, violating physical logic and dulling closure’s emotional charge; otherwise clean prose with strong verbs, but this artifact in the final third triggers a -0.7 deduction per Text Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Final paragraph’s "even in fragility, there is power" is stock thematic echo triggering -0.8 artifact penalty. Synonym loops ("resurrect it, to breathe life into echoes") and elevated diction ("calm defiance had become a force") dull closure’s immediacy. Figurative muddle in dance climax harms propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with clean propulsion, but "sand through fingers" cliché and "fragments of light" dilute specificity. No loops or scaffold, though generic phrasing in peak beats slightly obscures emotional texture without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.0)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("gurgle of water"/"brook’s gurgle") and elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic") trigger -0.4 accumulation cap. Propulsion strong but figurative muddle in "weaving threads of moonlight" slightly dulls closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose avoids scaffold except minor meteor shower description; "cosmos" and "whispered secrets" metaphors risk cliché but gain specificity through Clara’s tactile seal-gripping under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "velvet garden" and "tragically radiant" recur with charged specificity. Minor deduction for "heart raced" (label-only feeling) in high-pressure beat, but propulsion remains relentless through strong verbs ("dissolving," "weaving," "fading").

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "chain breaking within her soul" charging climax. Minor overwriting in "hushed embrace of the marble sanctuary" slightly dulls immediacy. No artifacts in closure beat preserves high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Template cadence ("Elara’s...") and synonym churn ("haunting melody"/"probing melody") dull immediacy. Overwritten metaphors in high-pressure beats ("reed-blown melancholy") reduce clarity despite lyrical intent.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops; high density in "crystalline walls humming with ancient energy." Slight overwriting ("world seemed to hold its breath") but no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line's "warmth could be found" edges toward sentimentality without breaking momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("whispering parapet" repetitions) and therapy-speak labels ("scintillatingly somber") dull momentum; no fatal artifacts but prevent 9.0+ with subtle closure proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("resonate with the diamond"/"pulse intensified") and filter-verb clusters ("felt a faint hum," "realized the truth") reduce propulsion in the climax, though rhythm remains controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.7)
    Minor scaffold in "fragments of the future that came to him in dreams, in whispers, and through fragmented radio frequencies" shows synonym churn. Elevated diction ("lyrically prophetic") slightly drifts from Elias' voice, though final image's concrete "wind carrying first light" saves momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose soars with textural density ("coat patched with stories," "sweeten and preserve like honey"), but "tune spilling like a river breaking free" strains metaphor coherence in the climax beat. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent "whispered/breath" lines, preventing 9+ despite otherwise impeccable momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    Final paragraph contains paraphrase loop ("battle wasn't over... purpose clear... role she would fulfill") and filter verb ("power still resonant within her"). Text-artifact penalty (-0.7) applies as artifacts dull closure image despite otherwise clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.9)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "softly purposeful" repeated with slight variation. Overwritten lyricism ("silver light... illuminating the path") risks muddling momentum but avoids closure-dulling artifacts in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold ("steps deliberate, mind sharp" followed by "mind raced") and template cadence in reflection beats; high density maintained except during journal analysis where momentum sags.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with dual-purpose lines ("melodies trapped in silence until Alistair’s hands set them free" ties setting to theme), but "calm before realization settled over him like a cloak" edges toward scaffold. No closure-impacting loops.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or artifacts; sentences like "a resonant hum that seemed to vibrate through her very soul" fuse propulsion with texture, while the final paragraph’s cadence ("acid sea churned... gears whirred") crystallizes closure without overwriting or diluting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion until climax; "sensed absence" synonym churn (4x) and minor scaffold in final paragraph ("realized... made decision") deduct 0.3 without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: "jagged and its surface dull" (redundant descriptors), "air hummed with energy" (generic metaphor). Strong propulsion otherwise, but figurative muddle dulls the reconstitution climax’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Fold in patience" appears verbatim three times with identical phrasing—synonym churn in peak beats triggering -0.4 artifact penalty. Otherwise strong density; "windborne solace" reprise slightly redundant but saved by final image charge.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym loops ("gently persuasive," "nurture connections") and filter verbs ("she felt," "she thought") in reflection beats; no closure artifacts but density falters during internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density ("silken walls rippled with faint hum of voices long since faded") and clean final image. Paraphrase loop in para 3: three lines stating tension ("breath steady," "strange authority," "air thickened") without progression during critical ritual beat, muddling pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("subtle puzzle archivist" opening). Strategic telling compresses backstory cleanly. Mild register drift in "transmute pain into masterpiece" avoids therapy-speak due to concrete anchoring in photo arrangement.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong line-level propulsion but "suspended hush" repetition (opening/ending) creates subtle paraphrase loop; "weathered innocence" phrasing borders on thematic echo without sufficient concrete embodiment in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold/loops; "string plucked long ago" mixed metaphor slightly muddles closure beat. High density throughout, though "frozen in mid-gesture" risks generic description.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion via active verbs ("dismantle," "reimagine") but "luminous ache" and "essence of time" verge on abstraction. Single paraphrase loop: "fleeting nature of moments... slipped through fingers like grains of sand" redundantly echoes earlier ephemeral imagery. Final line achieves textural specificity without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.0)
    Opening overwrites with stacked metaphors ("radiant haven... air shimmered"); filter verbs weaken immediacy ("Elara knew this was the heart"), yet final paragraph avoids loops with clean propulsion—cost proof ("sun dipped below clouds") lands without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats; high density ("shadows coalescing into swirling void") with purposeful rhythm variation, though "more familiar, more alive" shows slight synonym churn near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero figurative muddle in climax, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("cracks of imperfection"/"cleft in certainty") and scaffolded gravel-crunching→steady-steps transition dilute propulsion in closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    "Zephyr bloom" register drift in closure beat dulls final image; otherwise clean propulsion and density. Artifact in final third triggers -0.5 penalty and global 9+ disallowance.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural specificity ("liquid gold," "dew sparkled like stars") but overwriting in climax: "golden threads... intricate patterns" dilutes momentum. No closure-touched artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loops ("calloused yet graceful... hands remained steady") and filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; final third artifacts cap 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.7)
    Overwriting in key beats: "peripherally focused" repetition (para 1) and stacked metaphors ("warm like sunlight... fragile like snowflake") create density issues. Filter-verb clusters in high-pressure scenes (-0.5 cap) prevent higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops in closure beat with high density ("flame wavering as if uncertain of its own purpose"), but "spider’s web" metaphor slightly overwrites the tension; rhythmic control sustains propulsion through "kerosene lamp burner" repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops but "hauntingly practical" repetition in tool description approaches scaffold; "mane wild and untamed" avoids purple prose yet "crystallized time" strains physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor scaffold in "Regret clung to her like a second skin" slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise high density: "gears half-buried, its lens cracked but still gleaming faintly" does triple duty. No loops in peak beats; final line recharges motif with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control with purposeful abstraction ("labyrinth of intentions"), but scaffold phrases ("felt its weight, and noticed") dilute momentum. Zero artifacts in closure beat preserves earned stasis charge.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with "glacial hush" motif reweighting meaning, but "excruciatingly gentle" repetition in adjacent beats triggers minor scaffold penalty (-0.2) without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.1)
    Paraphrase loops ("clutched... relic; key, a promise") and synonym churn ("salvage what was lost... salvage what she could") dull momentum. Figurative density acceptable in calm beats but "serene upheaval" muddles pressure; no closure-impacting artifacts but scaffold penalties apply.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with minimal scaffold; rhythm varies ("fog rolled," "fingers traced"). Final beat’s "glowing softly" lacks propulsion. Near-miss on figurative muddle: "weavers had woven time itself" risks abstraction but saved by concrete knot imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "crisp air carrying scent of fallen leaves" redundantly echoes "autumn had fully claimed the land"; otherwise, zero scaffolding and potent propulsion ("light piercing darkness like tiny obituaries").

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with minor scaffold ("frayed and stained" then "bedraggled"); final paragraph's semicolon cadence slightly dulls momentum. No fatal artifacts, but overwriting in "crystalline spires glinting faintly in the dim glow" nips 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but elevated diction ("kelp-drift peace") clashes with firefighter POV in closure. High density achieved, though "roared above, their shadows dancing" slightly overwrites cloud pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero scaffold in early beats, but "troubling serenity" paraphrase loop (lines 14, 18, 22) appears in final third, dulling closure image; density high except during gear transformation where "symphony" metaphor drifts into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold loops; "frayed but still vibrant" and "thundering calm" achieve textural specificity without overwriting; minor register drift in "collective grief" (abstract noun) avoided by immediate concrete grounding in stone-carving struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "whispered secrets to the stone" exemplifies textural specificity. Near-deduction for "reverie that pulled him toward something greater" bordering abstraction, but saved by concrete context in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.1)
    Paraphrase loops ("whisper secrets"/"uncharted echoes"; "fragments of lives"/"whispers of countless lives") dull immediacy. Final paragraph’s thematic echo ("intentions endure") is stock phrasing; "velveteen gloom" opener overwrites with mixed metaphor (gloom organizing fingers).

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence in action beats ("he reached... pulled... dipped") triggers −0.4 loop penalty. "Cascade of possibility" overwriting dulls climax momentum despite otherwise vivid propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose sings with "luminous face" and "mist clung to windows," but "methodical, her strokes precise" scaffold dulls momentum; minor synonym loops ("fleeting shadows"/"faint luminescence") sap density in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.6)
    Overwritten density in "haunting testament to fragility, its jagged edges catching the light..." muddles physical logic; paraphrase loops ("grief and beauty of impermanence"/"fleeting emotion") weaken propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "thought of losing... was agonizing, but thought of staying... was worse" shows minor paraphrase loop (-0.2). No figurative muddle in peak beats; final image ("cog clutched tightly... realized his story was not over") crystallizes tension. Sentence variety supports rhythm, though one template cadence ("Kael...") appears mid-crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.8)
    "Traveled stillness" and "unlearning hatred" constitute diagnostic label-speak in high-pressure beats (-0.5). No loops, but abstract phrasing dulls closure’s immediacy despite otherwise clean prose.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose avoids loops but risks overwriting ("glow of a thousand moons"); "synaptic plasticity" feels jarringly clinical in otherwise textured narration, dulling momentum in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density with minimal scaffold; "faint hum of dormant energy" efficiently establishes setting, though "relic of bygone era" borders on cliché—no loops or artifacts dulling the potent final image's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose flows with high density—"rusted key no longer seemed discarded but purposeful" does triple duty. One scaffold: "Elias was inadvertently profound" abstractly tells rather than shows. Final line ("sanctifying the forgotten") avoids loops with strong verbs. Minor overwriting in "hushed blaze" compensated by payoff in closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with purposeful fragments ("thoughts were frantic, a jumble"), but "marble surface etched with the wear of ages" contains generic modifier weakening textural specificity in key image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.5)
    No fatal artifacts; lyrical density ("breath steady despite the weight") propels momentum, but "balancedly daring" is an awkward, unearned phrase that slightly muddles a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("brush seemed to hum... seemed to grow warmer") slightly dull momentum in high-pressure beats; otherwise strong density—e.g., "smog outside faded, replaced by clear sky" compresses transformation without scaffold—but not flawless for 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; “emerald tint seemed to pulse softly” avoids filter-verb clutter while embedding emotion. Final line’s “never truly be displaced” recharges the lens motif with conceptual weight. However, “rosewater dread” is near-thesaurus phrasing that slightly drifts from Elara’s lexicon in a high-pressure beat, costing 0.2 under Overwriting Checks.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with purposeful rhythm ("island seemed to sigh, its rocky spine exposed like ribs of ancient beast"). Paraphrase loop: "mind racing through the puzzle" followed by "mind already racing" dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Lingering luminance" overuse creates synonym churn in high-pressure beats. Filter-verb stack ("fingers traced," "mind racing") dulls immediacy during dictionary scene, but final image's "dying star" metaphor avoids muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold loops ("He was not merely... but...") and overwriting ("testament to nature’s resilience") clutter mid-beats. No closure-impacting artifacts, but "fractal-generating process" introduces clinical diction that clashes with poetic voice, dulling immediacy in a high-pressure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor synonym churn ("quietly driven, not by greed or glory") and one paraphrase loop ("cracks...cracks") in mid-scene; final line's "dread remained, but now tempered by hope" slightly over-tells where image alone would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose flows with purposeful rhythm, yet "illuminated letter" descriptions stack filter verbs ("shimmering faintly," "her key, her map"). Near-closure density avoids artifacts, but minor scaffold dilutes high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density in "waterlogged journal" discovery beat, but template cadence ("stepped," "waded," "bending") triggers −0.4 loop penalty; "hushed blaze" reuse in final third avoids closure damage but caps high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.2)
    No loops or scaffold, yet "tranquilly perceptive" recurs as near-synonym ("attuned," "intuition") without added pressure. Strong verbs ("lapped," "crouched") but climax’s "soft, ethereal light" slightly generic. Final line’s "journey beginning" lacks the textural specificity of earlier prose.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; high density in climax ("each crease a memory, each fold a moment of sorrow"). Mild overwriting in "mist clung like a lover’s whisper" but compensated by purposeful cadence shifts under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fractures and inclusions, each one a story of pressure") propels momentum. "Unfiltered awakening" repetition approaches paraphrase loop but redeemed by contextual deepening; no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.7)
    Template cadence weakens propulsion: "perpetually surprised expression" repeats verbatim three times, triggering -0.4 loop penalty. Strong specificity in "corroded brass box" and "fractured colors," yet "strange resonance" lacks textural density for peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sieved hush" repetition deepens atmosphere), though "relentless tide" creates minor figurative muddle in one high-pressure beat without dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold: "Her method was unconventional..." tells rather than shows moon phase system. Template cadence in paragraph 3 ("She took...", "She began...") triggers -0.4. No closure artifacts, but filter-verb clusters in high-pressure beats prevent 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("fractured heart"/"adrift, faith flickering") triggers -0.3 scaffold penalty. Otherwise strong propulsion, though "merrily melancholic" risks cliché but is redeemed by contextual specificity in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero scaffolding; "soft plop," "warm despite chill" compress setting and emotion. Minor deduction: "jaded wonder" slightly abstract amid otherwise concrete imagery, though final line’s "glow lingering" salvages specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose flows with rhythmic control, but "paradoxically steady" repetition and "weight of centuries" abstraction dilute momentum. Near-closure, "cosmic intimacy" phrasing borders on therapy-speak, muddying the final charge.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with clear propulsion, but "willingly perplexed" repetition creates a subtle synonym loop. Figurative language ("shadows that whispered") remains coherent, though "choking beauty" slightly muddles in the climax beat without deepening cost.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.9)
    No loops or scaffold; "harmonic resonance that began to unravel" does triple duty. Final line recharges "Eclipsed Dawn" with earned hope, zero figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with varied syntax ("toes sinking," "whispering hush"). Minor scaffold in opening ("timeless dance") but zero loops; figurative language serves pressure without muddle even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.4)
    Near-duplicate sensory phrasing ("faint flicker"/"faint shimmer") creates minor scaffold, but final image achieves high density with "quill holder glinting in the light" charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose soars in opening imagery but descends into scaffold loops: "the world felt different... as though friction itself had disappeared" redundantly tells what the rocks' shift should show. Overwritten metaphors ("kaleidoscope of light") dilute high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-loop in "fear, hope, regret, all dissolving" slightly dilutes climax; otherwise exceptional density with zero scaffold in closure beat where it matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "sunlight weaving through the chaos" recharges the opening "dignified chaos" with conceptual weight. Figurative language ("prismatic light," "labyrinth of uncertainty") avoids muddle by anchoring to concrete objects like the sundial's angles.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor scaffold in "crumbling spines"/"fractured darkness" near opening; no closure-dulling artifacts. Strong verbs ("molts," "forged") offset slight lyricism in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("battered, still held melody") and stock phrasing ("pulsed with life") dull momentum; final line’s "arbor sighed" achieves textural specificity but earlier scaffold dilutes peak-beat density.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lyrical and controlled, but "air shimmered with promise of life" risks figurative muddle early on. No loops or scaffold in closure beat, though "luminous doubt" recurs as label without concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; “dissolving them into the sea” achieves triple duty (action/image/theme). Near-miss with “rhythmically placid melody that soothed his weary soul”—risks purple prose but saved by tactile follow-up (“scent of damp earth and salt”). Final line’s “tides would continue to rise and fall” crystallizes closure without overwriting.
