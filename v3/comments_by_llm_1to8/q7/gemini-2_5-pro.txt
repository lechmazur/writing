  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("The life of the orchid was quite literally flowing into the life of the weed") but suffers from abstract telling in places ("profound sense of connection"). Some paraphrase loops appear (multiple ways of stating his detachment), and elevated diction occasionally clashes with scene urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "her kiln a maw of blackened brick." Some template cadence runs ("She learned...She sought...She knew then") and filter verb stacks reduce propulsion. The archeological metaphor and frost-reading sequences show good information density.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with effective variation in sentence structure and purposeful imagery. Deductions for redundancy ("quiet it had accepted"/"profound quiet"), some abstract phrasing ("phantom roar that now had no voice"), and occasional overwriting in metaphor density. The climactic sequence maintains clarity despite complex color-emotion mapping.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong verb choices and varied sentence structure. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some figurative density in the transformation sequence ("pulling the roaring ocean over his head like a blanket") borders on overwriting but serves the surreal moment. Minor template cadence in the final paragraph's parallel constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though several instances of abstract phrasing ("monochrome of want," "dog-eat-dog reality," "fragile bridge") and some filter verb clustering in emotional beats. The declaration sequence shows strong syntactic variety and rhythm. Minor redundancy in describing the community's suffering early on, and "authentic sounds" in the final line reads as unnecessary labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation during breathing sequences. Information density high throughout, particularly "Every vein on the jasmine petals was a river of light." Minor deduction for slight repetition in breathing cycle description, though it serves accumulative purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("The fragment did not shatter; it simply ceased to be solid") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("symphony of patient growth...cacophony of collapsing moments"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("memories...memory...recall" in close succession). Information density remains high in crucial beats, particularly the dissolution sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression, with lines doing multiple jobs (the arrow both signals and provides cipher). Minor register drift appears in phrases like "cacophonous, automated defense system" and some filter-verb clustering ("Elara heard," "She closed her eyes"), but information density remains high and no loops obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic variety and vivid imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("celestial bruise of emerald and rose bleeding across the polar sky") and abstract phrasing ("slow, inexorable march of biology"). The density of figurative language in high-pressure beats occasionally obscures momentum, though key images land with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines like "a ghost haunting the brief, perfect moments before dusk" doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("luminous disbelief," "sacred") fits the transformative moment. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in places ("impossible connection," "faint vibration humming") but no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, but several instances of explanatory redundancy ("The memory, frozen for years, began to liquefy, a painful, slushy ache") and occasional overwriting in metaphor density. The theatrical narration sometimes creates unnecessary scaffolding around simpler actions.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwrought moments ("violent, powerful certainty"). Information density high in decryption sequence. Minor loops around fear/terror vocabulary and some scaffolding ("It was Julian's escape plan") but momentum sustains. The "architect of his downfall" lands effectively despite slight elevation.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or concept simultaneously. Excellent syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the silence cataloging sequence. Minor metaphor density in places ("wind was a blade sharpening itself") but serves the heightened register.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density, particularly in "The cold of the courtyard and the cold of the ice became one, and through that union, a spark." Some filter-verb clustering ("It saw itself shatter... it saw itself ignore") and the abstract final paragraph slightly reduce momentum, though the closing image of the "perfect note" resonates.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. However, several overwrought phrases ("crystal whispering expanse," "dense, ringing silence") and some paraphrase loops ("shared and silent sorrow" restating what's shown). The "confessions of a grief so profound" line explains rather than trusts dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("blooming, withering grace," "river of living jewels"). Minor template cadence in the middle section with repeated "He [verb]" constructions. The marble polishing sequences achieve strong rhythm but occasional purple patches ("bled from the sky") create friction.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("mapped with fine white scars," "The icy air of the station now felt like a cradle"). Some overwriting appears ("profound, quiet vertigo," "mechanically warm and deeply resonant truth") but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("skeletal ribs of the upper balconies"). Some redundancy in "profound and resonant quiet" and mild overwriting in "trembling light, making the shadows dance like wraiths." Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("raw wool...scratching" establishes setting/discomfort/awakening simultaneously). Some elevated diction ("nascent light," "irrevocably blurred") occasionally drifts from POV register but serves the lyric mode. No loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the silence a physical pressure against my eardrums"). Some filter verb clusters ("I hoped," "I kept," "I thought") and minor redundancy in describing the factory sounds. Information density high in key beats, particularly the valve wheel sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density. Excellent rhythm variation from long, flowing sentences to shorter declaratives like "The peace here, once a comfort, was crumbling." Minor repetition of "crumbling peace" but it serves as intentional echo. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm that slows during the eclipse sequence to match the held-breath tension. Some elevated diction ("bruised twilight," "ethereal") fits the momentous occasion but occasionally edges toward overwriting. Information density is good—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Minor template phrasing appears ("trembling fingers," "tear-streaked face") but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "bronze quiet" establishes both atmosphere and thematic loss. Some elevated diction creates minor friction ("lyrical observation," "psychic") but doesn't obscure clarity. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively slows to match the weight of realization, though "fundamental human power" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the fortune cookie lines. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("cryptic fortune cookie writer, a strange cottage industry") and some template phrasing in transitions ("He saw," "He felt," "He turned").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching scene pressure. Minor figurative density in opening ("carving silence") and occasional elevated diction ("unnerving quiet," "oppressive smear") without full payoff. Strong information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong syntactic variety and momentum, with effective rhythm modulation during the dawn sequence. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for two instances of abstract phrasing ("conductor of unheard symphonies," "strings of causality") and one paraphrase loop around the memory-mapping concept.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery, particularly in sensory details like "Rain had just ceased, leaving the air tasting of ozone and wet metal." However, abstract conceptual language ("procedural generation," "algorithm for the maze") and some repetitive phrasing around memory and cycles create occasional density without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting as instrument, object as method). Some figurative density in emotional description ("gray fog," "filament of hush") without full payoff. Prose rhythm effectively mimics vibrational patterns through varied sentence lengths. Minor template tendency in audience reaction sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "translating the sky's fury into the quiet, ordered language of data." However, "possessed of a credibly curious nature" is awkwardly formal, and some passages edge toward overwriting ("deep, velvety blue"). The final paragraph's rhythm effectively builds toward closure despite minor density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision: "Glass panes, slick with condensation, fractured the afternoon sun into a thousand sharp, crystalline splinters." However, some figurative density slows momentum ("ghost that haunted his senses," "hollowing grief"). Minor loops appear in the grief descriptions, and some sentences could tighten without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, from the long opening sentence to shorter observations. Information density is high—the rope simultaneously holds "dust of the prison wall," represents past escape, and anchors present choice. Some figurative language approaches overwriting ("celestial dance that spoke a language older than words"), and occasional register elevation ("cruel fulcrum of his new reality") creates minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong sensory specificity and no loops or scaffolding. Minor density issues in the middle section where some musical descriptions could compress further, but the final paragraph achieves exceptional clarity with "The hush was not broken; it had been given a voice."

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong sensory precision and varied syntax, particularly in the transfer sequence. Minor redundancies ("This was the delicate part, the separation" followed by explanation) and some filter constructions ("He could feel") slightly dull immediacy but don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is solid with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of emotional summary ("cautious exuberance," "stunned, radiant gratitude") and some scaffold phrasing ("Intrigued, he had written back") create minor drag. The "profound click of understanding" edges toward telling what could be shown.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("sculptor of transient things in a world of permanence") but suffers from occasional abstract phrasing and repetitive structures. Some sentences explain rather than embody ("It was a humble offering, a practical prayer"). The opening and closing effectively bookend the transformation, though middle sections contain mild redundancy in describing Kaelen's outsider status.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm matching the story's focus on cadence. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "He [verb]" constructions in paragraph 4-5 and some scaffolding phrases ("He understood now how to act"). The metaphor "perform the most delicate illustration... with consequence" effectively bridges character and action.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though abstract scaffolding appears ("profound and stable understanding," "quiet sense of order"). Some paraphrase loops around the grief-as-geometry concept and occasional overwriting in figurative density during the light projection sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the dust itself had long since accepted" establishes both duration and belonging. Some mild figurative density ("sapphire hush," "phantom hand") but serves atmospheric purpose without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("skeleton of some great beast"), but some abstract phrasing ("sustaining transformation," "profound relief") and filter constructions ("he could see it now") reduce immediacy. Minor template cadence in middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("salt-crusted memories," "rickety causeway"). Some mild overwriting in the convergence description but it serves the accumulative pattern. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor scaffold in "Here was the story the object held, the missing piece."

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though "immense, ancient desire" and "humble instrument" edge toward elevated register in peak beats (-0.4). Information density strong in shadow communication sequences. Minor template cadence in "She saw... She saw... And she saw" structure (-0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and selective detail. Information density high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("liminal space," "reactively visionary") and occasional abstraction ("narrative of their shattered city") but clarity remains. Strong opening and closing images bracket the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the opening sequences. Information density is high without overwriting. However, some figurative language strains ("cathedral of space and revelation") and the truth-revelation paragraph contains near-paraphrase loops ("unspoken truth"/"truths too heavy"). The "trembling certainty"/"trembling heart" echo works as intentional callback.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose generally clean with good momentum, though some scaffolding appears ("He spent two days trying," "On the third night"). Information density varies—strong in sensory passages but thinner in exposition. The "courageously kind hands—kind to her memory, kind to this wild hope" stands out as purposeful repetition that works. Minor redundancies don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from density issues—figurative language in most sentences without clear payoff. Phrases like "cosmic vandalism," "spatial mutiny," and "symphony of unmaking" pile up. Some conceptual redundancy appears ("final, absolute cessation" could be "absolute cessation"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and information density. However, "deathly vitality" appears twice as somewhat forced wordplay, and phrases like "liquefies rigid thinking" and "brittle desperation" edge toward purple. The "fever dream" metaphor doesn't quite land.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "gilded-leaf stationer" establishes profession and implies lost craft tradition. Some minor repetition ("on the page" appears 3 times) but strong syntactic variety. The prose accelerates during the dawn capture sequence through shorter, more urgent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ink that declared me gone has more authority than the air in my lungs"). Rhythm varies naturally between longer philosophical passages and shorter action beats. Minor figurative density in places but serves the accumulative pattern without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is solid - most lines advance multiple purposes. Some redundancy in "Silence, profound and absolute" and occasional overwriting ("glorious, crumbling dome"). The "gloomy cheerfulness" construction feels slightly forced. No major loops or scaffolding, but could achieve greater concision in places.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Some overwriting in figurative language ("tidal wave of corporate order," "symphony of calliope music") and occasional elevated diction ("phantasmagoric," "anarchic soul") that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "the camera's shutter a soft, reverent *thump-clack* in the vacuum of his helmet" conveys action, emotion, and physics simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("ethereal," "sublime") creates mild register drift but prose remains propulsive through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity ("needle-thin applicator," "carbon wire filament"). Some filter verb stacking in repair sequence. Information density high in diagnostic passages. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions during repair.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean with strong moments ("tin can of a place at the edge of the known one"). Some metaphorical density in places ("water-veins show their heart on glass") serves the accumulative design. Minor issues with occasional abstraction ("worrying tranquility captured in ice") and one instance of telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "footsteps" that serves the accumulative structure. Information density is high with lines like "each stone was a key, each scuff and tap a carefully placed piece." Minor synonym churn appears with "ghost town"/"spectral"/"phantom" cluster and some elevated diction ("infinitely patient" repeated twice) that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting in figurative language ("liquid midnight," "lonesome splendor"). Minor template cadence in the memory sequence ("I felt...tasted...heard"). Information density is high and most sentences do multiple jobs. The final image lands with appropriate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("rusted iron needle stitching the gray sea to the gray sky") and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears briefly in "I saw it... It was through... It was not quite" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("bubble of glass against a tapestry of endless night"). Minor density issues with stacked modifiers ("sorrowful splendor," "mournful elation," "fierce devotion") and some abstract phrasing ("resonant awakenings," "spectral executor"). The final paragraph contains mild paraphrase loops that slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though several instances of overwriting appear ("hauntingly optimistic spirit persisted," "fragile dream of reverence"). The final paragraph contains some scaffold phrasing ("testament that even after") and the metaphor density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in abstract passages about beauty and desolation.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some abstract phrasing dulls momentum ("fostered a cautious enchantment," "resonated with the core concept"). The final paragraph contains slight redundancy between "peaceful acceptance" and similar emotional summaries that could be more precisely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Some instances of elevated diction that occasionally drift toward purple ("monoliths of silent gold," "ephemeral data streams"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "He [verb]" constructions. Information density is solid with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The cold of late autumn had settled deep into the bones of the cobalt observatory"). Some figurative excess appears ("spidery fingers," "silent symphony," "ghost-stitch" clustered) and occasional abstraction ("carefully cultivated perception was her greatest disguise") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, though occasional overwriting ("painful, luminous truth"). Information density high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some metaphorical density in opening paragraph borders on excessive but serves accumulative mode. The "ferocity of the evocation" phrase feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"pitted, convoluted fragment" simultaneously describes object and mirrors Elias's knotted memory. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm, particularly the shift to shorter units during the General's entrance. Minor deduction for "stark white plaster" and "glassy and unfocused" approaching stock description, and one instance of filter-verb clustering ("He felt...he saw").

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for slight overwriting in metaphors ("frozen lightning," "spectral fruit") and one instance of telling that could be stronger showing: "Frustration pricked at him" rather than embodying the frustration through action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "He was a restorer uncovering layers of paint, but here he was uncovering layers of existence itself." Some minor redundancy appears in the middle section's reality descriptions, but the final paragraph's precision compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong verbs. Some overwriting in figurative language ("daggers wrapped in silk," "cathedral of glass and steam") without clear payoff. The "converging chaos" phrase appears twice without adding pressure. Information density is good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of compression ("She was an insomniac poet, though she claimed neither the affliction nor the title") demonstrate economy. However, multiple instances of abstract articulation ("reef-shadow joy," "blossom armistice") and some paraphrase loops weaken line-level craft. The phrase "strange and wonderful new feeling" lacks specificity, and several filter constructions ("she felt," "she realized") accumulate without voice motivation.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid phrases like "pedestal of petrified air" and "lungs of a thousand ghosts." Some abstraction dulls immediacy ("extinct feelings," "forgotten names") and occasional elevated diction ("magnificent ruin") slightly exceeds the POV's established register. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for filter-verb clustering in paragraph 6 ("She saw...She saw...She saw"), some template cadence in "She saw his recklessness...She saw the glass ink well," and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during the spell sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied syntax. Information density is high - most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. Some figurative density in places ("bone-deep conviction," "geologic sighs") but purposeful. The "dappled with the creeping dawn light" construction feels slightly overwrought for the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "each microscopic waltz was a star." Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("bloom too fragile," "curling edges," "shores of solitude") and occasional template phrasing ("soft counterpoint," "gentle tide"). The paraphrase of withering/blooming appears multiple times without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery ("light breaking against crystal"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("featherly determined," "weather system of fractured realities") without full payoff. Minor template cadence in middle section ("He saw...He understood...He placed"). Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of lyrical precision ("slow-drifting galaxy of bioluminescent life") and effective rhythm variation. However, the final paragraph contains repetitive "he" constructions and abstract telling ("Belonging wasn't about...It was about...") that could be more embodied. Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and purposeful imagery. Strong opening establishes voice and stakes efficiently. Some figurative density in places ("cheerful gloom," "buoyant, three-note tune") without becoming overwrought. Minor issues with occasional abstraction ("the world's narrative") and slight redundancy in emotional color descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"indifferent glitter of stars" both describes and establishes tone. Syntax varies naturally with momentum building toward the light sequence. Slight deduction for "seemed to happen" and occasional elevated diction ("orchestrated serendipity") that briefly distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression, though some overwriting appears ("silhouette of obsidian grace," "grammar his society had decreed profane"). The transformation sequence maintains clarity and momentum despite dense figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally clean prose with strong sentence variety and purposeful rhythm. Some elevated diction ("noctilucent reckonings," "fundamental grammar") occasionally strains but remains within a glazier-philosopher's plausible lexicon. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor abstract tendency in places ("testament to his core motivation") but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong opening and closing lines with varied rhythm throughout. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for filter verb clustering ("Elias traced," "Kaelen stared," "Elias cradled") and occasional overwriting ("star-dusted darkness," "silver-and-charcoal skeletons").

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong moments like "millennia of tidal breath" and the transformation sequence where "decorations seemed to dissolve into pure light." However, some phrases lean toward overwriting ("serene upheaval," "staggeringly complex idea") and there's occasional redundancy ("quiet calm," "slow, inexorable"). Information density is solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is clean with strong information density—most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("curdle into catastrophe," "contagion for the sky") slightly strains the established register. No significant loops or scaffolding, though occasional abstract phrasing ("legacy's burden") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose maintains consistent rhythm without loops or scaffolding. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral art," "dormant dreams") occasionally tips toward purple but serves the mythic register. Information density high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. The "coded lullabies" mechanism could use clearer mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some overwriting ("velvet sky," "ethereal shades"), redundant descriptors ("ancient terrace"/"marble...cracked"), and occasional purple patches that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("navigated not by compass or star, but by...cracks in dried riverbeds"). Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("ephemeral guide," "amoral philanthropist") but momentum remains clear through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with lines like "Each step was a silent verse, her posture a stanza of perfect control." Some overwriting appears ("profound and alarming serenity," "silent, overwhelming wave of pure, colorless light") but doesn't obscure meaning. Information density is high, though occasional redundancy exists ("silent verse"/"stanza of perfect control").

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though phrases like "meteor hush" and "vivisectionist of the soul" occasionally strain for effect. Some redundancy in explaining Kaelen's artistic philosophy. The final image of stars as "tiny, distant pinprick of light" could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some figurative density in opening paragraph ("cradle of impossible green," "blushing stillness") but serves to establish tone. Syntax varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating during construction sequence. Minor scaffold in "transiently rooted" repetition but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and purposeful with strong information density - most sentences do multiple jobs. Some elevated diction risks purple prose ("ethereal waves," "pearlescent radiance") but remains controlled. The weaving sequence maintains excellent momentum through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "taste of ozone and forgotten starlight" demonstrate precise sensory work. However, abstract passages ("the path did not choose its walker; it grew the walker it needed") and some elevated register drift ("transcend its own limitations") create distance. The "precisely playful" dream sequence needed more concrete imagery to ground its symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the ritual sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("spiraling tower of glazed brick that clawed at the violet sky") and occasional abstract phrasing ("sealed his covenant not with a promise, but with a shared secret") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during escalation. However, abstract phrasing accumulates—"formless presence," "shimmering," "tempestuous energy"—creating opacity in peak beats. The line "a universe suffering a fever" exemplifies both strength (vivid metaphor) and weakness (slight overwriting) that characterizes the prose throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with zero loops or scaffolding. Every sentence advances the accumulative pattern toward closure. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm matching the breathing meditation. The precision of "fractals of nature" versus "sharp, vertical peaks" exemplifies the controlled specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is solid with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("spiderweb of stress fractures," "living architecture") and occasional redundancy ("foolish, angry act"). The "accidental wisdom" phrase feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "pistachio shell cameo blank, harvested from the Temporal Bough" establishes object, setting logic, and impossibility simultaneously. Varied syntax and paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, particularly the single-sentence final paragraph. Minor redundancy appears in adjacent concepts ("frantic, beautiful chaos" followed immediately by restatement of the same idea) and some ornamental description that doesn't advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic control in key moments. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("beings woven from ink and memory") and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages ("man stitched together from temporal paradoxes"). The musical motif provides coherent texture throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful metaphorical language. Some density issues with figurative language clustering ("shroud clinging," "skeletal rides," "warped deck" in opening). Occasional abstract phrasing ("negative space he'd left behind") and elevated register ("inexorable fading") that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("clean, complex energy, like a chord played on an instrument that had yet to be invented"). Minor repetition of "methodical" and template phrasing in places ("He found the rope...," "He returned to..."). Information density high in the weaving sequence. Final line lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean with strong information density and purposeful rhythm variation. Figurative language enhances without overwhelming ("symphony of nullity," "whirlpool"). Minor repetition of "hum" is contextually justified. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "thistle seed taking root in rubble," though some redundancy appears in the retrocognitive vision descriptions. The opening efficiently establishes world and stakes. Minor scaffold in "For years, he worked" transition and some filter verb accumulation ("he held it," "he saw," "he looked") dulls immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with sentences doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("spiderwebbed across a violet sky"). Some elevated diction risks register drift ("mnemonic scar tissue") but generally serves the piece's literary ambitions without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, but several overwrought phrases ("sun bled out," "riots of moon-petal vines") and mild register drift in descriptive passages. The "playing a serious game with ghosts" and similar elevated diction occasionally strains against Kael's practical artisan voice.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Its carved wings, veined like fossilized leaves, seemed to hold the faint starlight." Some minor repetition in "quiet" variants and occasional elevated diction ("profound silence descended") slightly above natural register. Strong information density and momentum overall.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and vivid specificity like "gray scar on green earth." However, abstract phrases ("pure potential," "barren soil of his fear") and slight redundancy in describing silence types prevent higher scoring. Opening and closing images effectively frame transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves lyrical precision with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of silence/quiet motifs. Information density is high—most sentences advance both external journey and internal transformation. Minor redundancy in explaining the teaching process ("This was his purpose, the action he was born for") could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "rivers of light"). Information density is good - most sentences advance plot or atmosphere. Minor issues: "deeply futuristic nostalgia" strains sense; some repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in the peeling sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("skeletal remains of rafters," "heat haze over cold cinders"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into abstraction. The phrase "loaded emptiness" appears twice, and some constructions feel workshopped rather than organic to the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "This was the Time of Manifestation, when concepts bled out of the mind and into the world." Some overwriting appears in metaphor density ("walking into the heart of a star," "cosmic scale," "siren call") during the climax. Minor scaffold in explaining the Promise's nature could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures, but several instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "eloquently silent" appears twice, "weighty question in the still air" feels forced, and metaphors occasionally strain ("architecture of her core concept"). The "distilled emotion" section contains abstract telling that could be more embodied. Information density is good but uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("shape of possibility itself," "single, dull certainty") and slight overwriting in places ("shivering bliss," "scoured him clean"). Information density is high and momentum sustained, though the metaphorical density in peak beats occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm modulation during discovery sequences. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("fractured thing," "vast, continuing story") and occasional redundancy ("quiet, professional curiosity" followed by "gentle precision") prevent higher scoring, though these don't touch the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Exceptional prose density with lines doing multiple jobs: "She moved with the unhurried pace of someone with nowhere important to be, a ghost in her own city."

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong information density. Each sentence advances atmosphere or action. Minor repetition of "careful/carefully" but no significant loops or scaffolding. Strong opening and closing lines that frame the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied rhythm, but some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("tremor of awakening," "shiver of awakening") and the repeated "mossy delight" phrase. The closing paragraph's "very, very small" construction feels slightly precious rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwrought phrases ("breathlessly alive," "phantom galaxies swirl and dissolve"). Information density high in discovery sequences. Deduction for occasional purple prose and one instance of telling what could be shown more concretely in the final philosophical resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures that support momentum. Minor figurative density in the ritual sequence ("incandescent joy of her memory") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Some elevated diction ("esoteric alchemical axioms") fits the alchemist POV but occasionally approaches register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery ("Each chord was a shard of agony, beautiful but broken"). Information density is high—most lines advance both atmosphere and plot. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("modestly fearless acceptance") and some predictable constructions in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The anesthesia evaporated like a ghost, leaving a residue of cold clarity"). Some philosophical passages ("mathematics of mercy," "variable they had failed to consider") edge toward abstraction but remain grounded in scene. Strong syntactic variety and momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong moments like "bruised purple sky" and "reef that should have jutted from the sea like a broken tooth" show specificity. Some filter-verb clustering ("seemed to thin," "seemed to shift") dulls immediacy in the transformation sequence. Minor paraphrase loop with "overlooked history"/"forgotten crew" concepts, though the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "Silence crashed down, thick and absolute." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some minor scaffolding in transitions ("This was the moment," "He worked methodically") and occasional redundancy ("profound, eternal worry" could be trimmed). The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the rupture sequence where "Every book, every piece of knowledge, every potential story flew from its branch." Some abstract phrasing ("monument to static perfection," "true existence") could be more concrete, and occasional register elevation ("foundational mathematics") creates minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, world, or theme simultaneously. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("museum of a world") and one instance of telling that could be shown ("He was a poetically inclined man"). The "old fire, banked but not extinguished" metaphor effectively charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful technical vocabulary. Some overwriting in figurative language ("slow theft...born to stop," "covenant of rust") and occasional abstraction ("pervasive lie," "ultimate falsehood"). The phrase "tinkertoy joy" feels slightly forced. Strong propulsion in the climactic sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean, purposeful prose with varied rhythm. Some elevated diction in places ("ephemeral," "bewildering maze") but it serves the contemplative tone. Information density high—most sentences advance both external and internal journeys.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("turbine-hum reverie," "timewoven alliances"). Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple functions. Minor issues with elevated diction and one instance of telling rather than showing ("Her life's work was no longer just about shaping wood").

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high in discovery sequences. Some figurative density in non-peak moments ("bruised sky," "stone giant slumped") and occasional elevated diction ("patient pilgrimage of observation") that could be more direct. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fever dream rendered in ink," "monument to defiance"). Some filter-verb clustering ("Kaelen felt," "he felt," "Kaelen opened") and mild redundancy in describing the arrangements. The coordinate revelation lands with appropriate syntactic simplicity against the earlier complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance both external and internal arcs. Minor issues include occasional elevated diction ("magnum opus") and some redundancy around the memory-creation process. The final paragraph's momentum could tighten slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the revelation sequence. Some elevated diction ("venerable," "ephemeral tides") occasionally feels overwrought, and "utterly unaware" in the penultimate paragraph reads as mild telling where showing would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though abstract phrases like "collapsing potential" and "metaphysical seeds" create occasional opacity. Some redundancy in describing the vortex's chaos across paragraphs 1-2, and filter constructions ("she felt it") weaken immediacy at the crucial final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Minor density issues with figurative language ("sea of perpetual cloud," "bones of the mountain") and one instance of telling that could be dramatized ("His conviction had grown from a seed of doubt").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("swept drifts of ancient starlight") but suffers from abstract descriptors ("fertile silence," "profound attention") and some template phrasing ("For years, this...," "One cycle..."). The climactic sequence maintains propulsion despite occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("burnish the sky," "dissolving like sugar in water") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("profound miscalculation," "profound, mute eloquence"). Some abstract phrasing ("contextual clues," "symmetric satisfaction") creates minor register drift that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the climactic sequence where short, sensory phrases convey the memory's immediacy. Some abstract phrasing ("fueled his quest," "gnawing sense") and mild redundancy around time concepts prevent higher scoring, but no major loops or scaffolding interfere with momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or character perception. Some overwriting appears ("bruised-purple clouds," "perfect shard of sorrow") but doesn't obscure meaning. The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths, though phrases like "slick, iridescent comma of emerald and black" border on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density—"Days bled into weeks" compresses time efficiently. Rhythm varies naturally from longer contemplative sentences to the short, decisive "He closed the book, and then he closed his eyes." Minor deduction for slight repetition in "slow" descriptors and one instance of telling ("His motivation was simple").

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, propulsive prose with varied syntax and strong information density—most sentences advance both external journey and internal resistance. Some minor repetition in the middle ("prickle of anticipation that was disappointingly unscientific") but the final paragraph's rhythm accelerates effectively toward closure. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The long jetty, a stone finger pointing into the corpse of the sea" establishes setting, tone, and theme simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful detail, particularly in the decoding sequence and journey beats. Information density is high—most sentences advance plot while building atmosphere. Deductions for repetitive "wild hush" bookending and occasional overwriting ("cascade of scratchy static," "fractured earth").

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density with phrases like "star-dusted swirl" and "syrupy waves," though some passages contain mild redundancy ("echoed silence...constant hum"). The vision sequence maintains propulsion despite complexity, but phrases like "higher state of awareness" and "beautiful chaos" lean toward abstraction over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("tooth of glacial ice," "bled where Polaris should have been") and occasional template phrasing ("filled with promise"). Information density high; most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor scaffold in final paragraph's explanatory mode.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "a click that echoed like a breaking bone." Information density high through multi-functional lines. Some overwriting appears in the opening ("nomadic penumbra," "perpetual twilight") and occasional abstract phrasing ("luminous absence of all she had lost"). No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "the whisper-light drag of a feather's edge" combining memory, sensation, and method. Some abstract phrases ("hidden thunder," "gravity") and filter constructions ("She could feel," "She understood now") reduce immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation, though some elevated constructions edge toward overwriting ("physical weight," "gut-shaking peal"). Information density high in the decoding sequence. Minor template cadence in "He had to... He began to..." construction but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied sentence structures. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("needle aimed at the heart of the sky") and occasional template phrasing ("mixture of hope and terror"). The final paragraph maintains momentum despite these minor frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and selective detail, with strong moments like "The world was a screaming green tumult." Some redundancy appears in emotional articulation ("My resolve crumbled, my intention turning to ash") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density, but the closure image remains untouched by these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the oasis description. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for overwriting in "temporary eternity, a moment that felt infinite" (conceptual redundancy) and occasional elevated register ("inevitable mistakes that compound before resolution" feels templated).

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Deductions for overwriting: "predawn bruise of purple and indigo," "testament to a lifetime," and the abstract "raw vibrations of intent." Some template phrasing in "Minutes stretched into an eternity." Information density could be higher in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("skeleton of forgotten ambition," "compass needle shivering") and minor synonym churn around loss/grief concepts. The clarity at closure remains strong with "silent song broadcast into the wasteland."

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose density is exceptional—nearly every sentence advances multiple layers while maintaining clarity. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate: "symbiotic relationship," "psycho-sympathetic resonance," "non-conductive mineral from a meteorite." The final image of the "silent, cerulean guardian watching over the first cornerstone" perfectly crystallizes the transformation without explaining it.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with moments of beauty ("mist at nautical twilight had stolen the horizon"). Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("tormented, haunted thing," "profound, aching connection"). Minor redundancy in explaining the gaps concept. Information density is good but could be tighter in the middle exploration sections.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some redundancy appears ("a vast and featureless plain" could lose "featureless"). The phrase "the promise was fulfilled not by entering, but by understanding" risks abstraction in a crucial moment. Strong sensory specificity throughout, particularly in the cavern descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the sun bled across the horizon" and effective rhythm variation. Some filter verb clustering ("Elara felt," "she saw") in the grotto scene dulls immediacy. Minor redundancy between "lacy menace" appearing twice diminishes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several overwrought phrases strain clarity: "palette of resolve...softened and swirled," "directed spontaneity," "singular method." The metaphor density occasionally overwhelms, particularly in the transformation paragraph. Information density is high but sometimes tips into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("psychic wreckage," "chronologically confused state") and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages that occasionally prioritize poetry over clarity. The "strange and fractured narrative" ending risks abstraction but maintains enough specificity to land.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with lovely specific images like "liquid heartbeats" and "spun glass" voice. Information density is high in the reading sequence. Deductions for repetitive "She [verb]" constructions in the middle section and slight overwriting in metaphors ("grief so old it had become part of his bone structure," "the universe recalibrated").

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some template cadence appears ("He drew...He was...He picked up"). Minor paraphrase loops around the crystalline affliction concept. The final paragraph contains some redundancy that slightly dulls the closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in the ritual sequence. Some overwriting appears ("dramatic silhouette of velvet and sharp angles") and occasional elevated diction ("cavernous quiet"). The "phantom limb" line achieves exceptional compression. Minor scaffold in setup paragraphs but momentum accelerates through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("her path a wanderingly exact spiral"). Some philosophical abstractions edge toward opacity ("a plenum of resolution") but remain comprehensible in context. The final paragraph's controlled acceleration from physical action to metaphysical merger demonstrates strong syntactic control.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Information density high throughout—"cathedral of brass and flowing water" does triple duty (scale/material/sacred). Syntax varies naturally between technical description and philosophical reflection. Minor repetition of "measure/measurement" in final paragraph slightly dulls impact but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("ghostly blue-green light," "sacred moment"). Minor redundancy in explaining the familiar strangers concept. The final paragraph's "profound exhaustion... extinguishing the quiet wildfire" borders on overwrought but maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong moments like "Her rebellion had always been a quiet, intellectual affair; she was only theoretically rebellious." Some abstract phrasing ("widened perspectives responsibly," "beautiful risk") and minor redundancy in explaining the contradiction concept. The "lucid contradictions" phrase appears twice without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation between Silas's flat statements and more lyrical descriptions. Information density is high—"black Bakelite antique, its rotary dial worn smooth by fingers that were now dust" does multiple jobs. Some repetition in the looping dialogue is pattern-taught and purposeful, though "semantic engineer" feels slightly elevated for the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong moments like "shallow ceramic dish, mixing ground gallnuts and iron salts" achieve high specificity, and the variation between long descriptive sentences and short declaratives ("It was never about fishing rights") creates effective rhythm. However, several abstract phrases ("haunted euphoria," "strange, shivering energy," "bewildered awe") cluster without sufficient embodiment, and the phrase "covenant" appears three times with diminishing impact. The prose remains clear but occasionally reaches for elevated diction that slightly obscures immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong moments like "a perfect monument for an era when the story of the world had begun to change" with good rhythmic variation. Information density is high with most sentences serving multiple functions. Minor scaffold appears in "He began through...The rumor was simple" sequence, and some repetition of "lonely/loneliness" could be varied, though neither touches closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in sensory descriptions that advance both external and internal journeys. Some mild redundancy in grief references ("desperate attempt," "craved in his soul") and occasional filter constructions ("he felt," "he absorbed") slightly slow momentum. The final paragraph achieves excellent compression.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrasing ("thresh meaning from that catastrophic experience") and occasional redundancy ("profound stillness settled"). Information density is high in action beats. Minor template cadence in "He..." openings mid-story reduces variation.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("divining rod for oblivion," "hole in the world") without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("He framed... He mapped... He clicked") but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments but suffers from figurative density that slows momentum—nearly every sentence in emotional beats contains metaphor or elevated diction. Template patterns appear ("He found...," "He moved...," "He remembered...") and some metaphors strain credibility (tenderness as both weapon and bedrock).

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments like "braided it into her marrow" but suffers from occasional overwriting ("a perfect fusion created in the echo of her loss") and register drift in peak beats. Some redundancy appears in describing the lagoon's transformation, though momentum generally holds through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for template cadence in "He pulled... He didn't consult... He unfolded" sequence and slight overwriting in metaphorical density ("poisoned bruise," "sickly green tendrils," "hollow as the container") within opening beats.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The pattern was not of aggression, but of welcome, a map of gentle inquiry." Some elevated register ("profound sorrow," "absolute resolve") occasionally strains but doesn't obscure. Information flows cleanly through the weaving sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong opening and closing lines with the "cobalt library" establishing voice and the "conversation that had just begun" resolving through action. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in "He saw... He heard... He felt" sequence and some abstract phrasing ("texture of a varied world") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and vivid specificity. Deductions for repetitive "finding" in climax, some filter verbs ("watched," "found"), and occasional overwriting ("soul-shaking thrum that vibrated"). The "combative tenderness" and "sharp-edged love" feel slightly forced as oxymoronic descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "whump-whump-whump." Some figurative density in places ("island in a sea of noise," "pocket of air in the crushing pressure") without full payoff. The abstract formulations ("cultivate lightness in grief," "remade hush") create minor opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance both atmosphere and meaning. Minor repetition of "boundary" concepts, but the accumulative design earns this patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some scaffolding phrases ("It was not," "It was a") could be cut. Strong imagery in "shimmering failures and flawed beauty" and the final resonator scene. Minor redundancy in explaining the barter mechanics, but the closing image lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some figurative density in peak moments ("cascades of faint, colored light that danced in the golden shadows") approaches overwriting but serves the accumulative design. Minor template cadence in "He [verb]" constructions mid-story prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("tears of fire, beautiful in their fleeting passage") with good syntactic variety. Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("smith, hammering his soul") and minor template phrasing ("He watched from the shadows as she") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though "she pointed with the edge of the measuring tape" and similar choreography creates minor drag. Some elevated diction ("epicenter," "cascade") fits Elara's engineering background. Template cadence appears briefly ("She slid...She showed him...") but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.3)

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of exceptional beauty ("landscape of a new scar etching itself") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching. Some abstract phrasing ("pregnant with a truth he hadn't wanted") and the metaphor-heavy middle section reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high throughout. Minor issues: "strange and aching" edges toward abstract; "perfect testament" could be more specific. The opening line and closing image create effective bookends. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "soul-scribe" and "ancestral echo from before she was human." However, the revelation paragraph contains abstract telling ("It was not a thought, but a memory she had never lived") and some elevated diction borders on purple ("incandescent arc," "ecstatic clarity").

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but "violent intrusion" and "phantom limb aching" in paragraph 3 strain for effect.

    The prose achieves strong atmospheric density with phrases like "amber warehouse" and "whisper-thin trickle of sand" that do multiple jobs. Information density is high, with each button description advancing both plot and theme. Some abstract phrases ("spin its rigid certainty into the raw possibility") and mild redundancy in explaining the prophecy's nature create minor drag, and "source code of their fate" reads as register drift that doesn't match the fantasy setting.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("silver hush of the mist," "gravestone" metaphor). Minor template cadence in "He'd left... He moved..." construction. Information density is solid but occasional abstract phrasing ("faithless world") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation and evocative imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation and strong information density, particularly in the discovery sequence. Some elevated diction ("schematic of polarized hues," "intricate lenses") occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("silence was a physical weight"). Information density high throughout. Some minor scaffolding ("She knew where to go") and occasional filter constructions reduce immediacy slightly but don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose generally propels with varied sentence structures and strong imagery like "the sky was alive" and "thousands of starlings pulsed in a single, fluid body." Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("silent, chaotic ballet") but serves the contemplative tone. Information density is high—most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. Minor repetition in "he was sure of it" type constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "liquid shadow" and "tiny, perfect void." Information density is high, particularly in the eclipse-shadow sequence. Minor issues: "whose lineage named her" is slightly awkward construction; "tired woman watching a miracle of her own making" veers toward telling what could be more embodied. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative openings ("dust of Xylos tasted like rust and regret") and varied sentence structures. Some figurative density in places ("brambled hope," "symphony of desperation") without clear payoff, and occasional template phrasing ("As they packed their few belongings, their movements now filled with").

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("breathtaking, impossible arrogance" could be simpler) and some abstract phrasing that reduces clarity ("pane of hush," "nested patterns").

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and vivid specificity ("copper-etched feathers," "solidified night"). Information density high throughout with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The air... tasted of wet stone and pollen"). Some density issues with extended metaphorical explanations and occasional redundancy ("beautiful in their impermanence" followed by extended explanation). Template structure in middle paragraphs ("He had spent... He demanded... But the river foam...") reduces momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("crystalline groves," "ethereal currents"). Information density high—most sentences advance concept and atmosphere simultaneously. The phrase "glimmering parole" appears twice without clear pattern-teaching. Some figurative density in descriptive passages but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though occasional overwriting appears ("motes of pale luminescence, each one a captured moment of regret"). Some abstract phrasing ("universe of stored remorse," "collective sorrow was a physical pressure") could be more concrete. Information density remains solid throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful technical language. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("vast, resonant consciousness") and some filter constructions. The multilingual elements and code create textural interest without disrupting flow.

    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Some overwriting appears ("breathtaking, lethal inversion," "cold and sharp" panic) and occasional template constructions ("He had to," "He was here because"). Information density is good but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally clean prose with good information density and varied sentence structures. The metaphor system (trees as orchestra, cracks as score) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density high in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("chrysanthemums of gold and crimson"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("tapestry of pinprick stars," "tear the night's velvet fabric") borders on excessive but remains coherent. The opening and closing sentences effectively bracket the piece with charged imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the turning of the tide's thought" establishes time, atmosphere, and metaphor simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend the journey. Some figurative language enhances rather than clutters ("liquid road," "silent, weightless ballet").

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful technical vocabulary, though several paraphrase loops appear ("frantic energy"/"raced to connect," "silence was the most alien"/"cathedral of stillness"). The revelation sequence contains some scaffolding phrases that could be compressed, and "singular convergence" appears both as prompt element and organically, creating slight redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and vivid sensory language. Minor issues include occasional abstract phrasing ("oscillating repose" appears twice) and some elevated diction that borders on overwriting ("sculpted hush that had form and weight").

    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("walls...catching light...like honey in a jar"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("lucid turbulence," "vortex") without full payoff. Clean prose momentum with varied syntax, though "unbearable weight" is slightly stock for this otherwise fresh diction.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity ("moleskin pouch," "filigree silver frame"). Minor redundancies appear ("breathless" after detailed breath descriptions, "undeniably real" where showing suffices).

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("quiet solemnity," "brittle layer"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple elements. Minor figurative excess in places but doesn't obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("silk that felt like captured twilight"). However, several instances of elevated diction clash with POV ("rapacious age," "sacred," "nexus"), and there's template cadence in "He placed...He didn't have...He bartered...He offered...He pushed." The paraphrase loop around giving memories (taste/feeling/sensations) costs additional points.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum and varied syntax. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some abstract phrasing ("fundamental instability of existence itself," "the weight of a withheld truth") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical descriptions ("soul realignment").

The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with good information density and varied rhythm. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("basso complaint," "cool, stone throat") and slight register elevation that doesn't always match the POV's established voice in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("thread of silver, strand of gold") but occasionally overreaches with compound fantasy names and elevated diction. Information density is strong, though phrases like "fractured swirl of perpetual twilight" and "graveyard of her thoughts" edge toward overwriting without quite breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The grand clock...nudging the night ever closer to the precipice of midnight"). Some elevated diction ("cavernous silence," "precipice of midnight") occasionally strains but serves the literary atmosphere. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. However, some filter constructions ("She noticed things like that," "she felt a strange calm") and occasional abstraction ("the creeping normality of decay") slightly dull immediacy in moments that could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm—short declarations ("The light died") punctuate longer descriptive passages. Information density is high without overwriting. Deduction for two instances of slight redundancy: "silent halls"/"quartz hush" and the double emphasis on cold/frozen which could be trimmed for greater efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows good momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some minor overwriting in "the metallic tang of unspoken agreements" and occasional elevated diction, but no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong sensory specificity. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues: "terrestrially cosmic" appears twice with unclear meaning, some abstract phrasing ("emergent compass" as "biological system") could be more concrete, and occasional elevated register ("celestial curtain call") slightly overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some elevated diction ("prismatic audience," "mnemonically gifted") occasionally slows pace. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor redundancy in explaining the painting's function as both depiction and diagram.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "glass-and-steel bubble against the perpetual ochre smog." Some density issues with figurative language ("sweet poison," "quiet hope bloomed," "breathtaking rush") appearing in clusters.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"The entire sculpture began to glisten with a vibrant, inner light"—but carries some overwriting. Phrases like "profound silence of his seasonal muteness" and "uniform grey of knowing" add unnecessary abstraction. Information density is generally high, with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, propulsive prose with strong verb choices ("groans," "writhing," "coalesces") and varied sentence structures. Information density high—most sentences advance plot while building atmosphere. Some abstract phrasing ("formless chaos," "visible distortion") and minor redundancy in describing the chaos's resistance reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation, though some elevated diction strains ("sandstorm calm in the swirling anxiety"). Minor template cadence in middle section neighbor encounters. Information density high in the locket discovery sequence where description serves function.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("soft as silt," "drawn from the ocean itself"). Some overwriting in the dance sequence with elevated diction ("cascade failure in a flawed decryption attempt"). Minor redundancy between "forgotten place" and later "forgotten tomb" but momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("fracturing it into a thousand shivering stars") but occasionally reaches for elevated diction that slightly strains ("a sterile procedure to cure a sorrow they couldn't diagnose").

Some mild overwriting in the gravitational field descriptions, but the clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean, polished prose with strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic," "insidious rustle") occasionally borders on purple but remains controlled. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in the middle teaching section ("grammar of groaning pipes," "syntax of settling foundations") borders on overwriting but remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some ornamental phrases slow key beats ("tragically radiant," "sibilant hiss"). Information density is solid with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in memory sequence ("He saw...He felt...He could") and some abstract descriptors that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. However, several instances of elevated diction border on purple prose: "pearl twilight," "luminescence filtered through the aurora," "a comma of liberation." Some redundancy in explaining the covenant's transformation. The "wisely enduring" feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing reduces immediacy ("webs of intrigue," "resonances of cosmic debt," "reed-blown melancholy"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Opening and closing lines effectively frame the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("walls weep history"), but some overwriting appears ("fractured memory crying out for witness," "human eclipse"). Template phrasing emerges in exposition ("For weeks, it has been broadcasting"). Information density is good but uneven—the confrontation scene could be more concise.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with lines doing multiple jobs ("each brief, brilliant pulse of light was a life flashing against the infinite"). Some philosophical passages edge toward overwriting ("vast, interconnected webs of existence") but rhythm varies purposefully with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, efficient prose with strong information density, particularly in the document reconstruction sequence. Some passages drift toward elevated register ("zone of life met the zone of death") that slightly tensions with Kaelen's pragmatic voice, and "perpetual grey sky" borders on stock imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative excess in places ("bruised-indigo lens," "slick and serpentine") without full pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in middle section ("One frequency would... Another would..."). No major clarity issues or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"grey silk of the morning sea" establishes time, texture, and mood simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("dense, weighted silence" followed by metaphorical weight) but generally strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that track emotional beats from discovery through transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally clean with strong rhythm variation and purposeful technical vocabulary. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("immense and temporary beauty," "parasitic soundwave") and the awkward "fleshly ethereal" construction that disrupts clarity. Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory detail. Minor overwriting in metaphor density ("wild animal clawing," "spider-webbed," "hammer blow") and occasional elevated diction that borders on purple prose reduces propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong moments like "places the sun never touches" and varied sentence structures. Information density is high in investigative passages. However, some phrases feel overwrought ("the echo of other people's memories faded"), and there's occasional redundancy ("quiet, steady burn" could be "steady burn"). The "fortified quiet" in the closing works well but "fortified" feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, but several overwrought phrases ("perilous state where faith wrestled with fact," "silent story in the still air") and minor redundancies ("profound empathy," "profound sense of peace"). The final paragraph's "vibrant, hopeful hush" feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high—most lines advance story, character, or atmosphere. Some figurative density in places ("fossilized command," "crystalline grammar") and occasional elevated diction. Minor scaffold in explaining the algorithm concept. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively builds to the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching tension levels. Information density high in discovery sequences. Minor redundancy in "sensed absence" concept (appears 3 times) and slight overwriting in metaphors ("digital constellations," "ghost data") but these don't touch closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "weighted breath" appears three times creating mild repetition. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("tableau," "resonance") occasionally drifts from established register but doesn't harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "yachts...like broken toys, their masts askew like praying hands" combines description, metaphor, and thematic work. Some figurative density in peak moments ("thousand crystalline heartbeats") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in "She had wanted...She had registered" opening.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The air was crisp with the scent of fermented earth and distant woodsmoke" establishes setting, time, and emotional tone. Some elevated diction ("profound silence," "skeletal structure") occasionally strains against the agricultural voice. Clean propulsion toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong verbs ("hissed and retracted," "coalesced"). Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("resonant truth," "absolute stillness") and slight overwriting in the consecration moment ("staggering mental weight," "profound rightness").

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the photograph descriptions. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("collective healing," "earnest whimsy") and occasional redundancy ("disparate moments of pain, confusion, and resilience") prevent higher scoring. The final paragraph's density serves the accumulative closure well.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The air itself felt preserved" establishes both atmosphere and theme. Some elevated diction ("poignantly obsolete," "sonically reflective") but consistent with scholarly POV. Clean prose with varied syntax supporting the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong imagistic precision in "bleached rib of wood," "weeping walls of granite," but some overwriting appears: "dreamlike longing," "gaping hole," "boundless, all-encompassing tide" cluster abstract modifiers. The "sonic equivalent" passage and several "was/were" constructions create minor momentum drag, though the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "luminous ache" appears twice and some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("a feeling as constant as the tides"). Strong information density in action sequences. The final paragraph's philosophical framing slightly slows propulsion but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition ("pulsing stillness" echoes effectively). Strong sensory details and information density. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("roadmap of translucent skin and blue veins") and slightly precious phrasing ("hymning the mundane," "decisively kind force").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in technical descriptions that advance understanding. Information density is high—most sentences do multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "crudely fashioned into the shape of an infant" and effective rhythm variation. Information density is high in discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("patient," "polishing"). Information density high in descriptive passages. Some overwriting in metaphorical language ("pearl of stillness," "zephyr bloom promising a soft unfolding") that occasionally obscures clarity. Template cadence appears briefly ("She began...She paused...She returned"). Strong opening and closing lines that frame the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Deductions for overwrought opening ("honeyed hush...soft weight"), some abstraction ("protected vulnerability"), and occasional purple patches. The clarity at closure remains strong despite these frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "starlight caught in her hair" and effective rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("the ceaseless drive of despair he had come to know as his own personal current") and occasional abstract phrasing ("hollow and cynical thing").

    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (the vine description establishes lineage, sacredness, and method simultaneously). Deductions for occasional overwriting ("thick with a gathering hush," "luminous coin") and slight redundancy in describing the light effects. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("frozen twilight, paralyzed and silent under the weight of its own anxiety") and varied syntax supporting scene rhythm. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "desperate art" and "moving stillness of purpose," but momentum remains strong and no loops or scaffolding mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the harvest of echoes" and "celestial clock hand," though some passages tend toward overwriting ("lull of a wounded season," "monochrome silence"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Minor register elevation in places ("singular focus," "arduous task") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "starlight was his ink" and "the frantic pulse of the grief began to slow." Information density high in ritual sequence. Some elevated diction occasionally tips toward purple ("whalebone reverie of Kaelen's existence") but serves atmospheric purpose. Minor redundancy in describing the transformation process. Clear propulsion through the ritual beats.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "He was all here and gone, a man of immense presence who had vanished like a breath on a cold day" show controlled rhythm and metaphoric precision. However, abstract phrases like "sprawling, chaotic archive of their life" and "crystallized time" lack concrete specificity, and some sentences could compress without losing meaning, particularly in the reflection passages.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("sound congealed like amber," "kinetic lagoon"). Some filter verb accumulation ("felt impossibly loud," "felt utterly") and the paraphrase loop of "He was a curator...a monument" in the final paragraph. Template cadence in "He was...He was" construction weakens the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful technical detail that advances plot. Information density is high—most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor weakness in occasional elevated diction ("hallowed glow," "cartographer's dream") that slightly strains against the engineering POV, but overall clarity and propulsion remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "silence shaping him as slowly and irrevocably as ice carves a valley." However, several instances of overwriting: "breathing jewel," "crystal whispering forecourt," and redundant phrasing in "bear it one last time"/"bear witness." Template cadence in "He did not...His task was simply" structure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves strong moments ("the water...was the color of a day-old bruise") but occasionally overreaches with abstract phrasing ("the architecture of lies," "liminal quiet"). Some filter constructions dilute immediacy. Information density is generally good with most sentences doing double work, though "profound hindsight clarity" reads as redundant given the title element.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong atmospheric control, though occasional overwriting appears: "profound oceanic hush" and some metaphorical density that borders on purple ("tendrils ghosting," "liminal hour"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing atmosphere or discovery. Some filter constructions ("he believed," "seemed to emanate") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density high with lines like "rust-colored chrysanthemums and fallen pear leaves plastered to the mossy ground" doing triple work. Some elevated diction ("translocation," "cartography") fits the scholarly protagonist but occasionally distances. Strong rhythm variation between long descriptive passages and sharp revelatory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty—"the world was a chasm of interlocking gears and pneumatic pistons"—but suffers from density issues. Figurative language appears too frequently in non-peak moments ("bedraggled grey," "jagged, salt-rimed," "velvet and salvaged brass" in quick succession). Some redundancy in describing Kaelen's deteriorating state. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "She was a firefighter, the daughter of an arsonist, and this place was her only church." Some metaphorical density in the fire scene ("crown of fire," "weeping gashes") approaches overwriting but serves the heightened moment. The final paragraph contains mild redundancy around the sand's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the defiant hush of her work felt like a rebellion against the silence." Some overwriting appears ("kaleidoscope of fractured colors," "luminous sigil of pure white light") that could be tighter. The ending suffers from slight abstraction ("liberated soul") where concrete image would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching emotional beats. Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("vessel for feelings too vast for a heart") and occasional abstract phrasing ("beautiful, flawed idea"). The final paragraph's syntactic control effectively builds to closure, though middle sections contain minor redundancies in describing the garden's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("spectral mentorship," "nexus where all his grandmother's faint lines seemed to converge") creates minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The great machine ticked around him, a metallic heartbeat he had synchronized with his own"). Some elevated diction ("incremental absolution," "micro-adjustment to the town's spiritual alignment") occasionally drifts from Elias's craftsman perspective but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "chess clock runs down on the world of the living," though occasional overwriting appears ("immense wooden frame" could be "large"). Some metaphor density in non-peak moments ("velveteen gloom that smelled of dry earth") but the figurative language mostly serves atmosphere and doesn't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with most sentences advancing multiple layers. However, abstract phrasing ("terrifying oceans of what was not," "adjacent possible") and occasional redundancy ("slow, certain fade") prevent higher scoring. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively accelerates toward the suspended moment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The world outside had long ago fallen quiet, a silence born from the great story famine that had scoured memory from the public square."

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose maintains strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror the ritual's stages. Information density is high, with lines like "curator of endings, its charcoal portrait ash scatterer" doing multiple jobs. However, some abstract phrasing ("vast grief," "profound quiet") and occasional overwriting ("transcendent peace," "somber marvel") create minor opacity. The final sentence, while thematically resonant, runs long and could achieve greater impact through compression.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high, particularly in world-building passages. Deductions for occasional redundancy ("meager haul" followed by extended description of scarcity) and some elevated diction that borders on purple ("grand gallery," "cosmically useless").

    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high, with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for repetitive "vanishing" constructions and slight overwriting in phrases like "slow, magnificent decay" and "traveled stillness" that edge toward purple without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "metal skeleton sighing over the ruins" and the taste-memory descriptions. Some register drift appears ("guided synaptic plasticity," "sculpting a mind made of root and leaf") that feels authorial rather than character-driven. Minor redundancy in explaining the pruning metaphor, but information density remains solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("last rays of sun bleed across the sky") and good rhythmic variation. Some redundancy in explaining Silas's motivation ("quiet, stubborn desire" followed by extended explanation) and slight overwriting in places ("silent, cascading consequence") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves density with lines like "She was a student of creeping normality, a silent archivist." Some elevated diction ("sanctify," "infinitesimally") creates mild register drift. The "hushed blaze" repetition works thematically but borders on template phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in "This was supposed to be a tomb to hubris, not a cradle of life." Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the granite foundations of the lighthouse settle" and purposeful rhythm variation. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing both atmosphere and plot. Deductions for template cadence in "He had discovered... He had built..." structure, some filter constructions ("Elias felt"), and occasional overwriting ("bleak exhilaration," "cold fire") that could be more precise. The final paragraph maintains momentum despite its length.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity ("sweetness that coated the back of my throat like a lie"). Some template cadence in the mirror confrontation sequence. Information density is strong when annotations guide action, weaker in pure description.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong sensory specificity ("wispy mare's tails," "sun-bleached cedar") and effective rhythm variation.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum, though some overwriting appears ("sun-baked certainty," "profound isolation"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in middle section ("He realized... He began to see...") and one paraphrase loop around pattern recognition detracts from otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation and effective metaphors (crimson petal as "final, silent syllable"). Information density is high without overwriting. Minor deductions for occasional elevated diction ("mausoleum choked with ivy") and some repetitive structural patterns in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("ancient drawbridge groan its way upward, severing the peninsula").

Information density is generally high with purposeful rhythm variation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally maintains clarity and momentum, with effective rhythm variation in "The drone stopped, hovering before a section of the dome that looked identical to every other weathered panel." Some redundancy appears in "perpetually surprised" repetition and mild scaffold in "There was only one thing to do." The technical vocabulary serves character authenticity, though a few abstract phrases like "quiet enigmas" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong opening and closing images. Information density is good with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for metaphor density in places ("sandpaper on bone"), some abstract emotional language, and occasional redundancy ("withheld truth...unspoken words").

    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong specific details. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("vast, silent ocean contained within a calm shell") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. The "cosmic intimacy made manifest" and similar phrases edge toward purple prose but don't fatally obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery, but several passages loop concepts ("Lost time didn't pool...wasn't a debt...was simply vapor"). The "terrifying undertow" and "aching soul" phrases edge toward emotional summary rather than embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Kwan Yin's Tear," "needle thin as a whisper"). However, abstract phrases accumulate ("ghostly resolve," "sacred trust," "profound and total lightness") and some template constructions appear ("One by one," "Finally, only one"). The scaffold around emotional states occasionally shows.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and rich imagery, though occasional elevation borders on overwriting ("vibrant hush," "whispering hush"). Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs, and the rhythm effectively modulates with the scene's building intensity.

    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("ink-black backdrop," "profound quiet"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in the middle section and occasional elevated diction ("luminous foundations") that could be more direct.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression ("a title given by ghosts"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor scaffold appears in repeated "had to" constructions and some synonym churn around patterns/sequences/spirals that creates slight redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence lengths and effective rhythm, particularly in high-pressure moments. Information density generally high—most sentences advance multiple elements. However, some redundancy appears ("silent, violent light" / "silently blasted"), and phrases like "cartography of scars" and "whisper passed through the white noise" edge toward purple prose without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation between contemplative observation and kinetic fencing sequences. Information density high in lines like "His mechanical arm moved with a grace that belied its construction, the faint whirring of its internal chronometers a quiet harmony to the metallic song of his blade," though occasional elevated diction borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (moon tracks time while creating atmosphere). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("luminous fracture") that slightly exceeds POV lexicon in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, figurative density in places ("drop of silvered sorrow," "steely longing...forged...into a blade") approaches overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. Some elevated diction ("transient pathways," "audacity of his composition") slightly strains the register.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong momentum. Minor issues include filter-verb clustering ("she could almost feel," "She felt"), some abstract phrasing ("the weight of her purpose"), and occasional overwriting ("riot of impossible blues"). Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "Each cut was a question asked of the silence." However, abstract descriptors accumulate ("rhythmically placid," "melancholic blue," "profound shift") and the phrase "tides of remembrance" appears twice without evolution, creating mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences performing multiple duties. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a high-pressure beat ("liquefy, a painful, slushy ache"), which creates a minor rhythmic stumble but does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, propulsive, and largely free of artifacts. Figurative language is character-motivated and coherent ("phantom limb of a past," "earthquake in my soul").

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly crafted with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("dark mirror," "skeletal ribs") is consistent and purposeful. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in phrases like "profound and resonant quiet," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's moment of peak revelation, though it does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("auroral sorrow") is pattern-taught and pays off, and syntax modulates perfectly with emotional pressure without obscuring clarity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative ("a three-word sickness I’d swallowed"). There is a single, minor instance of potential scaffold in the phrase "My motivation for being here, for crawling..." which slightly paraphrases the opening line. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional and supports the atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("its current a slow, inexorable pull of liquid starlight"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Rhythm is varied and supports the atmospheric pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat: “a cautious exuberance filled him, the thrill of potential brushing against the deep respect for the pain” uses two metaphors where one would suffice. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished with strong rhythmic control. Sentences are propulsive and advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously ("A profound sorrow, heavy and resonant as bronze, settled in Kaelen’s chest").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly crafted with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact occurs in the phrase "a dimensional anchor humming at a frequency felt only in the bones," where the conceptual redundancy of "felt only in the bones" slightly dulls the precision of "humming." This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a potential register elevation in "reverse-engineering a soul to find its source code," which slightly clashes with the more embodied lexicon elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity. Minor deduction for slight overuse of "crystal" imagery ("crystal shadows," "crystalline splinters"), which creates a subtle template cadence but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor register drift occurs in the climax with phrases like "cosmic perspective" and "flickering between them," which feel slightly elevated for Elias's voice in peak stress, preventing a higher score.

This does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor artifacts: a slight thesaurus-churn feel in "luminescent ache" and "deft and patient," and a filter verb stack ("he saw," "he realized") in the discovery beat slightly dulls immediacy. However, clarity and propulsion remain excellent, and the closure image is undimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm that accelerates in crisis. Figurative language ("frost flowers," "cathedral-like structure") is precise and serves the world. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. The final line lands with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly accomplished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor deduction is applied for a slight density of figurative language in the climax ("vortex of wind and sound," "unheard symphony"), which, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring immediacy in a high-pressure beat. No loops or scaffold issues are present.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lush and precise, with a strong rhythmic cadence that supports the story's epic tone. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple duties of character, setting, and plot advancement.

    Exceptional line-level craft with high information density, rhythmic control, and zero prose artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and legible, even in peak beats. Every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or the accumulative drive of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A very minor deduction for the slightly contradictory phrase "cheerful frustration," which feels like a near-duplicate concept. Otherwise, the language is precise, vivid, and propulsive, with no scaffolding or loops to obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly vivid and efficient ("a chaotic symphony of calliope music, sizzling fry-oil"). Rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with the scene's pressure. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle obscure the clarity of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and concise, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. A minor -0.1 deduction for a slight register drift in "purposefully curious ache," which feels slightly analytical for peak interiority. Otherwise, information density is high, and propulsion is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted: dense, rhythmic, and clear without artifacts. Sentences vary naturally and accelerate with pressure ("Time was thinning"). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent; no loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously (e.g., "Condensation began to bloom..."). Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "worrying tranquility," which feels slightly outside the POV's lexicon in a peak beat, but it does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "a resonant awakening"). However, there are no loops, scaffolds, or muddled metaphors, and clarity is never sacrificed, especially at the crucial closure.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent rhythmic control. However, a cluster of figurative language in the peak beat ("snarl of a thousand lives," "dissonant orchestra") creates a slight density artifact that, while effective, slightly obscures the clarity of the protagonist's pivotal action of focusing on the single memory. This minor muddle in a peak beat caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat ("a sound so terrible it had been stricken from time itself"), which slightly obscures clarity. Otherwise, information density is high and propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor rhythm issue in the long sentence beginning "Her love was a poison...". Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold; figurative language is coherent and purposeful, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong information density. Minor artifacts: "orchid solace" risks decorative phrasing, and "profound, dusty silence" is slightly generic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "lotus-hearted ache" risks register drift, feeling slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat. However, it does not obscure closure and is an isolated instance in otherwise flawless line-level work.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.5)

Otherwise, zero loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances atmosphere and character.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifact: "cathedral-quiet" is a slightly ornate compound adjective. A near-paraphrase loop occurs with "reckless" / "carefully reckless" / "reckless gamble," but it's pattern-taught and supports character voice, causing minimal momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("His workshop was the crumbling amphitheater... a place of ghosts and geologic sighs"). There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, specific diction ("bruised purple" sky, "pitted surface"). Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact exists: "the withering had made space for a fragile, tentative blooming" leans slightly diagnostic, but it is immediately followed by concrete action, mitigating the effect.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density, often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "featherly determined" conveys trait and tone). A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats, such as "held open like a prayer," which, while effective, contributes to a pattern of elevated diction that occasionally borders on ornamentation. However, these moments do not obscure causality or dull the closure image, and the sentence-level propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation. However, a minor artifact exists: the phrase "a moment of pure, unadulterated grace" is a slight summary label in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. A minor deduction for a slight rhythmic stumble in the phrase "the glass transliterates emotions, but now it showed the truth behind them," which creates a small jarring shift in tense and flow within a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly evocative and precise, with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. There is a slight tendency toward density in a few descriptive phrases (e.g., "the blackened maw of a fireplace"), but this is largely voice-motivated and does not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. A very minor rhythm stumble exists in the long sentence listing the city's visions, but it's a hairline slip that doesn't obscure clarity. Otherwise, the line-level craft is masterful and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("cracked like a shattered promise").

Momentum is unwavering, and every sentence advances the story.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.6)
    Line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Most sentences advance multiple jobs of story, character, and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "the last ember of the campfire surrendered its ghost of heat" do multiple jobs advancing story and atmosphere. A single, minor instance of a template cadence ("He looked... He reached...") prevents a higher score, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., setting, character, theme).

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is polished to a high sheen, with exceptional rhythm, clarity, and concision. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("sun bled across the horizon," "drew a map of sorrow in the sky"), never muddying sense.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.6)
    Exceptional line-level craft. The prose is dense, poetic, and utterly precise, with every image advancing character and atmosphere. The rhythm accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs, and the final paragraphs achieve profound clarity and resonance without a single figurative muddle or loop.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("silence of a forest after a fire"). A single, minor scaffold phrase ("profound, sickening sense of failure") slightly abstracts a peak emotional beat, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, line-level craft is publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.5)
    Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and zero artifacts. Every sentence advances story or atmosphere ("a perfect, translucent ghost of a life that had moved on"). The prose is propulsive and vivid, with a controlled, varied rhythm that supports the emotional beats. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, purposeful metaphor. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "brittle hush" is used twice, creating a slight paraphrase loop. However, this does not obscure causality or dull the closure, and the prose otherwise demonstrates masterful concision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose demonstrates high information density and clean propulsion, though occasional decorative phrases ("spun moonlight") slightly dilute peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. No loops or scaffold issues obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("fruitless observation," "meticulous") and the slightly abstract "brittle tension." However, these do not obscure closure. Figurative language is consistently purposeful and legible, supporting the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. One minor artifact: the description of the tea leaf reading ("This cluster here... falsehood") leans slightly toward exposition, creating a small momentum drag in an otherwise taut high-pressure beat. No other loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptional, with high information density and lyrical precision. Sentences are propulsive and varied, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. The read-aloud rhythm is masterful ("its roar a steadying bass note").

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "silent scream that echoed only in the soul") which, while effective, borders on over-writing without quite crossing the line into obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.7)
    Exemplary line-level craft. Prose is dense, lucid, and propulsive, with high information density ("a physical wound in the landscape of knowledge"). Rhythm is varied and purposeful. No artifacts, loops, or scaffold detected. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished, dense, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor artifact exists in the slightly over-written description "their pages swollen into pale, indecipherable flowers," which leans decorative. However, this is a isolated instance; the language is otherwise precise and propulsive, with no loops or scaffolding to obscure the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("sea of clouds," "tinkersong wonder"). Sentences vary in length and structure to mirror the building tension and subsequent release. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and rhythmic, with high information density. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("the iron-clad grief she wore"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the reveals.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is flawless, with high information density, zero loops or scaffolding, and exquisite rhythmic control. Figurative language is coherent, purposeful, and heightens pressure in peak beats without obscuring clarity. A masterclass in line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing ("fractally precise veins") which, while apt, slightly slows momentum in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, information density is high, and there are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and clear propulsion. Minor figurative stacking ("bleed from the horizon") doesn't obscure clarity. No loops or scaffolds; closure image lands with precision ("cartographer of living light").

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the high-pressure beat describing the Orrery's light ("unbearable, overlapping cascade"), which momentarily slows propulsion without obscuring causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. Sentences efficiently advance character, setting, and plot simultaneously, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for slight over-writing in phrases like "a breathtaking, impossible arrogance," which edges toward summary, but clarity and propulsion remain strong, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly concise and propulsive, with exceptional information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies effectively, particularly in the assembly description ("a stuttering, halting motion that nonetheless achieved a perfect, functional whole").

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "monomers of air and water linking into temporary, beautiful chains" advances both plot and theme). Rhythm varies naturally, and there are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Information density is high without sacrificing clarity, and the final line lands with resonant precision. Read-aloud quality is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush, precise, and highly evocative, with excellent rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting is present in phrases like "his thoughts mindfully scattered" which verge on abstraction, and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats creates a subtle density that momentarily slows momentum without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight overwrite in the opening line ("bruised creosote" feels slightly forced). Otherwise, sentences are clean, rhythmic, and advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle obscure the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly evocative and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. A minor deduction for a moment of potential register drift ("psychic repositories") which feels slightly academic for the POV, though it is quickly anchored by the more visceral "screeching, dissonant roar." Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are maintained, especially in the climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("swimming through a storm of ghosts"). Minor overwriting in peak beats ("chaotically precise rhythm" slightly redundant). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and legible, though one mixed metaphor ("storm of ghosts" and "tide of sorrow") briefly muddles clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and clear propulsion. Sentences are concise and advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the final line ("dawn of a much greater responsibility"), which feels slightly elevated compared to the concrete prose preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, accelerating with the scene's needs. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. Every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or story momentum with concision and beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. However, minor overwriting exists in peak beats: "mournful and sublime," "hopeful melancholy" are slightly stacked modifiers. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating toward the climax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, but the minor ornamentation in high-pressure moments prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory specificity. Minor overwriting appears in a few phrases ("the precise aroma of potential," "violent spectacle of joy"), creating slight register drift that feels slightly elevated for the POV in those moments. However, these are minor artifacts that do not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. Information density is high and momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory density. A minor deduction for a slight repetitive stem in describing scents ("nutty, earthy aroma," "nutty fragrance") which creates a subtle template cadence, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. The description of the Anechoic Heart is a peak beat that maintains clarity and propulsion. One minor loop ("silence" appears twice in close succession) prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and vivid, specific imagery ("haze tasted of salt and rust," "chaotic eddies and baffling pressure sinks"). Momentum is well-maintained, though a very slight scaffold is detected in the transition "Days bled into a gray continuum," a phrase that, while effective, is a common stylistic bridge. No artifacts obscure clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional dense metaphorical stacking (e.g., "a wave of verdant light that tasted of new grass and felt like a cool hand on a fevered brow") which, while beautiful, slightly risks clarity in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and controlled with excellent rhythm. Minor artifacting appears: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("avalanchingly quiet pressure") and a near-paraphrase loop ("It wasn't forgiveness... It was a single... note of truth"). This prevents a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and highly figurative but maintains propulsion and clarity, with high information density. There is a minor risk of overwriting in the peak beat ("vortex of lucid turbulence"), but the figurative language remains coherent and serves the atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Sentence-level rhythm is expertly controlled to accelerate and breathe with the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences performing multiple duties of character, setting, and plot. A slight figurative density appears in the climax ("garden of frozen light blooming"), which, while beautiful, leans slightly decorative for the high-pressure beat. This minor artifact prevents a higher score but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptional: high information density, zero artifacts, and masterful rhythmic control. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("a lattice of pale, crystalline stone," "the sound of a held world"). Every sentence advances character and atmosphere with concision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and a compelling rhythmic flow. However, a minor prose artifact penalty is applied for a cluster of near-synonyms and conceptually adjacent phrases in the final paragraph ("beautiful and clean and utterly without context," "peacefully, completely alone") that creates a slight textural loop and marginally dulls the sharpness of the superb closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("captured twilight") is purposeful and pattern-taught. A minor template cadence appears in the description of the packed satchel but does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Sentence-level craft accelerates and breathes with scene needs. A single minor stumble in rhythm occurs at the climax ("The truth landed with its full, crushing weight.") which slightly abstracts the moment, but clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally clear and concise, with high information density. Sentences accelerate and breathe with the scene's needs. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("a luminescent ache," "the steady heartbeat in the storm"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure sense, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, even in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm accelerates and breathes perfectly with the scene's needs, supporting clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for one potential artifact: the phrase "quietly explosive" is repeated, which, while likely intentional, slightly dulls the unique impact of its first use. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A minor, almost imperceptible template cadence exists in the paragraph beginning "The phantasmagoria of images bloomed..." where a series of "the [noun]" phrases create a slight rhythmic pattern, but this does not obscure clarity or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly lyrical and largely effective, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. A minor deduction for a potential "stacked modifier" or slight register drift in the opening line ("fractured swirl of perpetual twilight"), though it is largely voice-motivated. The climax is clear and propulsive, with no loops or scaffolding obscuring the crucial action of weaving the dawn.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Every sentence advances story or atmosphere, and the prose remains lucid and propulsive even under peak pressure, particularly in the climax of his observation of Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences often do multiple jobs, advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("Moss ate the marble and ivy scaled the walls, a slow green conquest"). A minor rhythm stumble occurs in "It was a tender sort of defiance," which feels slightly summary-like, but this is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beats or obscure causality.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally clear and concise, with high information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold. There is a minor risk of density in the resonator description, but it serves the moment. Rhythm varies naturally, and the final line achieves textural specificity. No loops, synonym churn, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and propulsive with strong rhythm. Minor artifact: the phrase "the metallic tang of unspoken agreements" is slightly over-written, feeling more like a narrative assertion than filtered through Elara's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical yet maintains clarity and propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("ships pulled into a phantom harbor"). Minor deduction for a slight register drift in "terrestrially cosmic," which feels slightly elevated for the POV, but it is a hairline slip that does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("auroral sorrow"). Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating through the lock-picking sequence. The final line is a perfectly cadenced image that resolves the thematic arc.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. One minor artifact: the phrase "sweet poison on the recycled air" leans slightly toward a familiar metaphor, creating a small figurative muddle in an otherwise precise opening. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure. Sentence-level propulsion and clarity are otherwise exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without obscuring clarity; sentences often perform double duty, advancing both image and theme. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven ("kinetic sculptures," "frozen tears"). The final paragraph's rhythm accelerates then stills, mirroring the symphony's arc.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and highly atmospheric with excellent information density. A minor template cadence appears in the climax ("The chaos coalesces. It fights... The screaming in my head ceases..."), creating a slight rhythmic loop that slightly dulls the peak beat's immediacy. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("point of sandstorm calm") is purposeful and legible, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.5)

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in "leviathan" and "ephemeral," which feel slightly elevated for Silas's internal lexicon, though they are not egregious and do not harm closure clarity. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacting appears in a few dense, figurative clusters (e.g., "tranquil blaze," "placid inferno") which slightly dull the immediacy of peak beats but do not obscure closure. Overall, high information density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("silhouette stitched from twilight") is precise and voice-motivated. No artifacts, loops, or scaffold obscure clarity, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical yet maintains clarity and propulsion, with high information density. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm expertly modulates to match the intensity of the memory recovery.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exquisite, dense, and purposeful, with a compelling rhythmic flow. One potential mixed metaphor ("treason of semantics, a betrayal so subtle it was almost an act of reverence") slightly muddles an otherwise flawless peak beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is publishable, with zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is immaculate: dense, precise, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language, such as chaos being an "ugly, alien equation" or energy being "fossilized on a plastic canvas," is both original and perfectly suited to the character's voice. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep. Every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and plot, achieving a rare synthesis of poetic language and narrative propulsion. The prose is clean, avoiding any overwriting or scaffolding, particularly in the final paragraph, which brings all the story's elements to a resonant and inevitable close.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with high information density and strong rhythmic variation. The specific, inventive language used to describe the emotional colors ("incandescent violet," "jagged, searing orange") is a major strength. The score is held back slightly by a few instances of familiar phrasing ("violent symphony," "canvas of her mind") that feel less fresh than the surrounding text.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. Figurative language is strong and purposeful, such as pulling the ocean “over his head like a blanket.” While there are one or two minor instances of filtering ("He watched as..."), they are fleeting and do not detract from the momentum. The overall craft is clean, demonstrating a strong command of rhythm and syntax that propels the narrative forward to its powerful conclusion without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and purposeful, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Lines like "hunger outvoted suspicion" are both economical and powerful. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting; its figurative language is controlled and effective ("unlocking memories like rusted gates"). The final paragraph is a masterclass in rhythmic prose, bringing the story to a close with clarity and emotional force.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and highly evocative, with strong verbs and striking figurative language ("surfaced like a drowned thing"). However, a few moments lean toward overwriting, where dense, abstract phrases slightly impede momentum (e.g., "her own state of foggy lucidity, a painful clarity seen through the haze of a soul she’d once been"). The explanation of the final vision also verges on summarizing the image's meaning, a small lapse in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and high-impact, with strong imagery and high information density. Lines like "a ghost haunting the hallways of his own history" are superb. A few phrases in the climax, such as "cataclysmic roar," feel slightly more generic than the otherwise highly specific language, which is the only element holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences like "The chain was a part of her, a cold iron ligament" are immediately impactful. A few phrases lean slightly towards abstraction ("profound stillness of a patiently strategic mind") where a more concrete rendering could have been even stronger, but these are minor slips in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece with no loops or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional information density. Figurative language, such as the aurora being a "celestial bruise," is both beautiful and purposeful, reinforcing the story's tone of pained endurance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, the final paragraph contains a few instances of thematic paraphrase that slightly dull the impact of the closure. Lines like "Destiny's door wasn't something you listened to; it was something you watched unfold" and the direct contrast of past and future ("He had sought to reinterpret the past... Now, he held the future") verge on explaining the story's point rather than letting the final, powerful image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, but a few lines rely on abstraction where concreteness would be stronger. For instance, "The core concept that had guided her for so long..." is a moment of telling that slightly undermines the showing. Similarly, the final sentence's "weighty lightness" feels a bit too much like a thematic label, slightly dulling the impact of an otherwise powerful closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, propulsive, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences are well-constructed, with varied rhythms that match the pacing of the narrative, from tense climbing to focused decryption. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops. The writing occasionally leans on abstract emotional descriptors like "an earthquake in my soul," but these instances are infrequent and don't detract from the clarity or momentum of the powerful final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with strong verbs and precise, sensory language. However, a couple of minor line-level issues prevent a higher score. There's a slight paraphrase loop in the second paragraph ("hummed just beneath his skin, a quiet, insistent vibration") that could be tightened. The figurative language is overwhelmingly strong but occasionally strains, as with the "dimming velvet" of the sky.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is clean, concise, and elegant, with a high information density where every word serves a purpose. The rhythm and syntax are controlled, mirroring the robot's economical movements in the beginning and unfurling into more complex, lyrical sentences during the climax. Figurative language, such as "ghost impressions left on the timeline’s fabric," is purposeful and thematically coherent. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, paraphrase loops, or overwriting, demonstrating polished, professional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery ("a lock and a wound all at once"). However, a few moments slip into abstraction where concrete embodiment would be stronger. Phrases like "ambiguously clear" and the summary in the penultimate paragraph ("confessions of a grief so profound it had no vocabulary") are minor flaws in an otherwise stellar piece, slightly flattening the immediacy of the peak emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence serving character, plot, or tone. Word choice is consistently strong, favoring concrete imagery and active verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific, sensory imagery ("skeletal ribs of the upper balconies"). However, a few minor instances of summary ("his motivation was simple," "It was a complete musical thought") momentarily break the otherwise immersive "show, don't tell" execution. While these are small blemishes, they slightly reduce the momentum in what is otherwise a polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and purposeful. Sentence structure is varied, word choice is precise, and there are no discernible artifacts like loops or scaffolding. While the figurative language in the opening is dense, it successfully establishes the story's literary tone and voice without muddling clarity. Every sentence serves to advance atmosphere, character, or the central inquiry, demonstrating high-level craft and momentum control.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and controlled, with high information density and strong rhythmic variation. Word choice is consistently excellent, from "devouring dark" to "sleeping iron beasts." There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought figurative language; every sentence serves to build atmosphere, advance the plot, or deepen the character's internal state with remarkable efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, a few phrases tread on familiar ground, such as "the silence was not an absence but a presence," which slightly softens the impact of an otherwise pristine piece. This minor reliance on a well-worn trope is the only element holding the craft back from true exceptionalism.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is often luminous, with sharp, specific images ("a perfect comma of spun gold"). Its primary weakness is a tendency toward abstract or slightly overwrought phrasing in key moments, such as "beneath the hush of dreaming roots." This, combined with the thematic summary in the final sentences, prevents the line-level craft from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with virtually no wasted words or scaffolding. Line-level craft is superb; sentences like "The displaced axis was not merely terrestrial; it was psychic" achieve maximum impact through concision. The consistent high register and rich figurative language ("cupping memory like water," "ghost of the ink") serve the story's melancholic, elevated tone without slipping into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless. The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative without a trace of overwriting.

The piece avoids overwritten prose despite its dense figurative language, as the metaphors are integral to conveying the abstract nature of Kaelen's work and internal state. The line-level execution is virtually flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, concise, and evocative, with high information density in nearly every sentence. The rhythm and syntax support the story's building tension and ultimate release, and the word choice is precise. While a few phrases lean toward high abstraction (e.g., "darkening brightness"), they function within the established voice and do not detract from the momentum or clarity of the powerful closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lyrical, precise, and demonstrates high information density. Lines like "a tapestry woven from vibrations that held the shape of emotion without the distraction of noise" are both beautiful and functional. The sentence structure varies to control momentum, accelerating during the performance and settling into stillness at the close. While the figurative language is dense, it remains coherent and purposeful, serving the story's unique sensory world.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is immaculate, with high information density and a controlled, elegant rhythm. Figurative language is sophisticated and integral to the story's meaning, not ornamental ("celestial dance," "weave of a moment").

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, controlled, and demonstrates high information density. The rhythm and syntax modulate effectively with the scene's intensity. Figurative language, such as joy being a "bright, popping energy" and suspicion a "negative drag," is not merely decorative but serves to make the abstract sensory details concrete. There are no loops or wasted words; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates a good sense of rhythm, with varied sentence structures. There are strong, evocative phrases like "tallied tonnage and tariffs" and "curator of pages." The piece loses points for moments that drift towards sentimentality and cliché, such as tears "catching the starlight and transforming it into something brilliant." These instances of overwriting, while infrequent, slightly dull the otherwise polished craft.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its descriptions. The sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm that mirrors Kaelen’s emotional state. There are one or two moments where the interiority verges on being overly articulate (e.g., "This was the core of his luminescent ache"), but these are minor and don't detract from the overall momentum or the power of the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in its descriptions of the chaotic water and crystalline structures. Information density is high, with evocative and purposeful language.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with a strong, controlled rhythm. Line-level craft is a significant strength, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The score is held back slightly by a few instances of near-cliché ("mask of grief and academic ruin") and moments where the lyrical quality borders on overwriting, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in most sentences. The rhythm is controlled and purposeful. A few phrases in the final two paragraphs, like "profound relief of not needing them immediately" and "sustaining transformation," lean slightly toward summary, momentarily thinning the otherwise impeccable line-level craft right before the close.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, confident, and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Phrasing like "chaotic calligraphy" and "haggard awe" demonstrates a strong command of language. The rhythm is varied, the syntax is controlled, and there are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding. While excellent, it narrowly misses the 9+ band due to a few moments where the figurative language, while beautiful, feels slightly more decorative than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, clear, and evocative, demonstrating high information density and strong sentence-level propulsion. Word choice is precise and imagery is vivid without becoming excessive, such as the "swirl of dancing shadows and fractured light." The narrative is free of scaffolding, loops, or other prose artifacts, resulting in a smooth and immersive read from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Word choice is precise and sensory ("soft, sucking sounds," "a slurry of sand and shell fragments"). Sentence structure is varied, creating a rhythm that is contemplative yet maintains momentum. The piece is remarkably clean, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, even in moments of heightened emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, concise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The sentence and paragraph structure vary to create a compelling rhythm that carries the reader forward. There are a couple of instances of slightly abstract summary, such as "the thrum of a perfectly calculated risk," that could have been more concretely embodied, but these are minor and do not detract from the story's overall momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively, building momentum that culminates in the climax. A minor paraphrase loop in the final paragraph ("a sanctuary of memory, a true space for reflection") slightly echoes an earlier phrase ("sculpt a proper space for reflection"), a small blemish on otherwise stellar line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in lines like "watch galaxies bloom and wither like celestial flowers." Figurative language is generally strong and purposeful ("cosmic vandalism"). There is a minor tendency towards a "He [verb]" sentence structure in the middle, but it's brief and doesn't significantly impede the story's powerful momentum and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptional: clean, evocative, and dense with purpose. The language achieves a lyrical quality without sacrificing momentum, as seen in phrases like "the thunder of the grift" and "a life of glittering lies." There are no wasted words or repetitive sentence structures; each line works to build atmosphere, advance the plot, or deepen characterization with impressive efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of immediate, publishable quality. Sentences are crafted with high information density, balancing evocative imagery with narrative propulsion. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought figurative language. The choice of specific, strong verbs and the varied sentence structure create a rhythm that is both elegant and compelling, perfectly matching the story's tone of "incandescent restraint."

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, evocative, and flawlessly controlled. Figurative language, such as grief as an "aching violet," is consistently fresh and integral to the narrator's unique sensory world, never feeling ornamental. The sentences possess a tidal rhythm that mirrors the story's structure, demonstrating a rare synthesis of line-level craft and overarching narrative design. There are no wasted words or scaffold; the piece is polished to a fine sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in every sentence. Word choice is masterful ("wind-scoured," "monotone prayer to physics," "mournful counter-melody"), creating a powerful atmosphere without overwriting. The story is free of loops, scaffolding, or cliché, demonstrating a strong authorial ear. The final line—"note by resonant note"—provides a perfect, resonant closure that echoes both the method and the newfound purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and propulsive, with strong figurative language ("a mainland word that tasted like rust and finality"). Momentum is well-maintained. The primary weakness is a minor but noticeable tendency to use summary labels for internal states in key moments ("simple and agonizing," "torment of a dual allegiance"), which tells the reader the emotional conclusion rather than letting it fully build through concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with sentences often performing multiple functions of characterization, world-building, and mood-setting. Word choice is precise and powerful ("sublimated directly," "reverent *thump-clack*"). While a few early phrases verge on being slightly overwritten (e.g., "deep and purposefully curious ache"), the overall effect is one of masterful control, with zero technical artifacts, loops, or momentum-dulling constructions. The prose propels the quiet narrative with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density. Word choices are precise and evocative (“perpetually slick with condensation,” “a dissonant, painful thrum”). The piece is nearly free of artifacts, with a varied sentence structure that propels the narrative forward. While the line defining her motivation is direct, it functions as a powerful character thesis rather than an authorial intrusion, integrating smoothly into the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional: concise, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Information density is high, with phrases like "a speck of sharp-eyed judgment" and "a worrying tranquility captured in ice" performing multiple functions of characterization, setting, and tone. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence propels the narrative forward or deepens the atmosphere. The final line is a masterclass in closure, resolving the scene while resonating with the story’s core themes.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the narrative forward. While the language is consistently elevated, it rarely tips into overwriting, instead serving to build the story's unique, slightly mythic atmosphere. There are no notable loops or scaffolding; nearly every word serves a clear purpose in advancing the scene or tone.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, marked by strong verbs and evocative imagery ("The hush did not flow in; it lunged."). While exceptionally strong, a few phrases like "hurricane inside me" lean on more conventional metaphors, momentarily softening the otherwise unique texture. However, the line-level craft is overwhelmingly clear, dense, and free of significant artifacts, successfully carrying the story’s ambitious concept.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is largely outstanding, marked by high-density, evocative imagery. However, a minor prose artifact slightly dulls the momentum leading to the discovery: the phrase "a narrow door... left ajar for decades" is repeated in consecutive sentences. While the second instance is rephrased, the repetition is noticeable and could be condensed for greater propulsive force. This is a small blemish on an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with a strong sense of rhythm. The high density of modifiers is a deliberate stylistic choice that successfully serves the story's gothic tone without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity. The line-level craft is free of significant artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum, especially in the frantic climax. A minor weakness is a slight tendency toward ornate, pre-packaged literary phrases like "orchid solace" or "hauntingly optimistic," which, while fitting the tone, occasionally soften the immediacy of the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is frequently stunning, with sharp, evocative imagery, particularly in the opening paragraph. The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-crafted. The score is slightly tempered by a few instances where abstract summary replaces concrete action, such as describing the reconstruction as "a direct counterpoint to the decay and abandonment," which tells rather than shows the significance of the act.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong opening and a sure-footed rhythm. Word choice is precise and imagery is sharp. The primary weakness is a handful of sentences that lapse into conceptual summary instead of maintaining momentum through action or perception. Phrases like "His method was one of layered deception, a communication protocol built from nostalgia and innocence" are abstract and slightly redundant, momentarily flattening the otherwise excellent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished to a high sheen, demonstrating exceptional clarity, density, and elegance. Word choice is precise and evocative, with figurative language that is both beautiful and thematically coherent. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The line "A conspiracy was a thread of the wrong color" is a standout example of the story's seamless fusion of character and concept at the sentence level.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with a strong, varied rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a thick, palpable atmosphere from the first sentence. The only minor weakness is a consistent reliance on high-density figurative language that occasionally borders on being overwritten; however, it never obscures clarity and largely contributes to the story's distinctive, gothic tone. There are no technical faults, loops, or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative from the first sentence to the last. Information density is high, with every description and observation serving character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously (e.g., "a lotus-hearted ache blooming in his chest"). The language is sophisticated without being overwrought, and the rhythm of the sentences effectively mirrors the hushed, tense atmosphere of the clinic. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the craft is clean and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, with strong verbs and varied sentence structures that create a compelling rhythm. Clarity and momentum are excellent. The only minor weakness is a tendency towards a very high density of figurative language, which, while often beautiful, occasionally feels slightly overwrought and pulls focus from the core action, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with exceptional clarity and momentum. Sentences are crafted for maximum impact, such as the description of the final bewitching as "a silent implosion of potential." The story is free of overwriting or scaffolding; every word serves to advance character, atmosphere, or the central concept. Figurative language is fresh and precise, enhancing the story's surreal beauty without ever feeling strained.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is very strong and often lyrical, but it is held back from excellence by a few minor artifacts. Phrases like "carved into the bedrock of his soul" and "raw steel beneath" feel slightly familiar in an otherwise highly original piece. The repetition of the key phrase "converging chaos" also stands out as a slight redundancy. These are small slips, but they prevent the line-level craft from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong, with evocative and rhythmically controlled prose. The information density is high, with sentences like "Verse by verse, she was building a garden from a wound" doing significant work. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward overwriting, where the density of figurative language becomes almost overwhelming. Phrases feel exquisitely crafted but occasionally draw attention to their own construction rather than remaining transparent to the emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with figurative language that is both original and emotionally resonant ("captive light of forgotten dawns," "the color of a hand held out in the darkness"). The rhythm is controlled and deliberate, mirroring the character's movements. The phrase "a beautiful, toxic sadness, the foxglove regret of saving the memory but not the life," while potent, is slightly more abstract and explanatory than the surrounding prose, constituting a minor blemish on an otherwise stellar piece.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in nearly every sentence ("Dust motes danced like constellations"). The language is consistently elevated and evocative. A few phrases, such as "betrayed the frantic beating of his heart," verge on the familiar, representing a minor friction that slightly tempers the otherwise exceptional line-level craft, keeping it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and purposeful, with high information density in each line. The language is both technical and poetic without feeling strained. There is one minor moment of "telling" ("a love so profound it ached"), but for the most part, the craft is impeccable, free of loops or scaffolding, and propels the narrative with a steady, confident rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and consistently high-quality, with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is both beautiful and purposeful, such as grief being "a withering thing, curling the edges of his life." There are no signs of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting; every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or plot with remarkable efficiency and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong opening and closing lines that frame the narrative effectively. While generally high-quality, a few phrases like "bloomed in his chest" and "featherly determined" lean on familiar constructions where more specific imagery could have elevated the moment. These minor slips in an otherwise polished piece keep it from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic control that shifts with the scene's emotional weight. The language is precise and dense with meaning. A minor flaw is the tendency to occasionally summarize an internal state or method ("His approach was softly ingenious...") rather than letting the action carry the full weight, but the overall execution is polished and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with vivid, economical descriptions that do significant work (e.g., "cheerful gloom," "a hopeful turquoise marred by a sudden, jarring slash of obsidian black"). The momentum is excellent, driven by clean syntax and purposeful paragraphing. The only minor weakness is a single sentence of exposition ("The only way to fill the void was... the traditional method..."), which briefly tells rather than shows, but the overall craft is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with virtually no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is fresh and effective, such as the tide's "rhythmic hiss" or the glow-stick's "stubborn pulse." The line "The event did not feel performed; it simply seemed to happen" verges on thematic statement, but it functions effectively as a summary of Kael’s artistic goal, reinforcing the story’s core conceit rather than weakening it.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is ambitious, elegant, and demonstrates high information density with excellent rhythmic control. Clarity is maintained throughout, and there are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding. The only minor friction is the sheer density of figurative language in the final paragraphs, which, while effective, verges on being overwritten and slightly dulls the impact of any single metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous, precise, and economical, with high information density in every line. Figurative language like "a ghost of glass and geometry" or "the world’s quiet prose" is both beautiful and functional. The rhythm is controlled and meditative, perfectly matching the story's pace and culminating in a final paragraph of stunning clarity and power with zero artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, with vivid imagery and controlled rhythm. However, momentum and clarity are harmed by the final paragraphs, which devolve into abstract summary. Sentences like "He needed to enlighten them, not with lectures or warnings, but with shared vulnerability" and "...turned it into a map for the path ahead" are scaffolding. They explain the story's function instead of trusting the preceding scene to have done the work, dulling the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates high information density, with memorable phrasing like "serene upheaval." The rhythm is varied and propulsive. A minor flaw appears in the final paragraph, which leans slightly into summary ("It wasn’t a final victory, but it was a verified, positive result") rather than allowing the image of the gauge to carry the full weight of the conclusion. This is a hairline slip in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless, characterized by high information density, syntactic variety, and evocative, concise language. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere. The prose is particularly strong in its descriptions, such as theories that "curdle into catastrophe," which are both original and perfectly suited to the story's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, with evocative imagery and a strong rhythmic flow. However, there are occasional moments where it leans toward explaining the magic rather than grounding it in concrete sensation, such as "not as a sound to be heard, but as a vibration to be felt." While minor, this slight tendency toward abstraction in key moments holds the line-level craft just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and rich with effective figurative language. However, a few moments slip into telling rather than showing. The line "The flawed beauty of the scene was breathtaking" is an authorial intrusion that summarizes the effect instead of letting the imagery create it, a minor but distinct flaw in an otherwise high-quality piece of prose.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep into overwriting. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as the egg's speckles looking like "tiny, frozen embers." The sentences are constructed with precision and elegance, driving the narrative forward while simultaneously building a thick, elegiac atmosphere. There are no technical flaws or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and often beautiful, with a strong rhythmic quality. The language successfully carries the story's high concept. At times, the density of figurative language becomes slightly overwrought ("profound and alarming serenity," "spectral residue of emotions"), and a few abstract phrases could be grounded in more concrete imagery. The final paragraph contains some light scaffolding that summarizes the plot's effect.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptional quality: elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative, from the opening "meteor hush" to the final "vast, waiting quiet." There are no wasted words, scaffold, or loops; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or the advancement of the internal plot. Figurative language is fresh and seamlessly integrated into the narrative voice.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and immaculately controlled. There is zero scaffolding or redundancy; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or action. Figurative language, such as the "blushing stillness" or the monarch migration as an "interrupted cadence," is fresh and purposeful. The rhythm of the prose mirrors the story's action, moving from stillness to focused activity and returning to a deeper, more resonant quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality: elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, with no overwriting or wasted motion. Sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm that mirrors the calm focus of the protagonist's work, accelerating slightly into the climax. The piece is devoid of loops, scaffolding, or cliché, demonstrating a mastery of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and a poetic precision that never feels overwritten. Phrasing like "a taste of ozone and forgotten starlight" and "the crisp oils of memory" is both evocative and efficient. The prose is meticulously clean, with varied syntax and a powerful rhythm that propels the short narrative forward without a single wasted word or clumsy construction.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—elegant, precise, and highly efficient. Sentences like "He hoarded silence and starlight, resources more precious than the plundered gold" perform immense character and thematic work with grace. The language is consistently elevated without becoming overwrought, and the complete absence of scaffolding or textual artifacts ensures a seamless and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, with strong, clear sentences and a purposeful rhythm. The high-concept language is largely effective and avoids overwriting. However, the momentum is slightly dulled by moments of summary that replace dramatization, particularly in the final paragraph ("The choice was made," "The core concept was finally understood"). These instances of telling, rather than showing through the final resonant image alone, prevent the prose from achieving a higher tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to control momentum, slowing for the meditative ritual and becoming crystalline in the description of the frost mountains. Word choice is consistently strong, with phrases like "a lattice of frozen breath" and "bruised twilight" achieving maximum effect with great economy.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, evocative, and efficient, with high information density in nearly every line. The language is precise and sensory ("scent of apple blossoms and damp stone," "low, vital thrum of acceptance"), building a tangible world. The rhythm and syntax support the story's emotional shifts, from frustrated stasis to the flowing realization at the end. The final paragraph's slight move toward summary is a minor stylistic choice that barely detracts from the overall excellence of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, demonstrating both precision and lyricism. Word choices like "achingly empty" and "inexorable blooming of a night-fused flower" are evocative and purposeful. The sentences are well-constructed with varied rhythms that propel the narrative forward. The density of figurative language is high but remains coherent and effective, contributing to the story's otherworldly atmosphere without obscuring meaning or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, elegant figurative language ("smoke made of scripture"), and a strong, controlled rhythm. Sentences are constructed with precision and clarity, propelling the narrative without a single wasted word or clunky phrase. The final paragraph achieves a powerful crescendo that perfectly mirrors the thematic and emotional resolution of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative. Word choice is consistently strong ("skeletal rides," "cellular surrender"), and the sentence-level rhythm propels the narrative forward while reinforcing the melancholic, dreamlike atmosphere. The piece avoids overwriting, with its figurative language feeling earned and integral rather than decorative. The repetition of "unkindled solace" is purposeful, functioning as a thematic anchor that pays off powerfully in the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often elegant, with strong figurative language like the clock tower being "the needle that stitched them together." The momentum is steady and the sentences are well-constructed. A few moments rely on slightly familiar phrasing ("steady, practiced grace") or lean toward thematic summary, which holds the piece back from the highest tier of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, precise, and highly evocative. Figurative language is strong and purposeful, such as the ice being "clear as forgotten air." The rhythm of the sentences effectively mirrors the story's tension and release, moving from grinding, complex sentences describing the noise to simpler, calmer ones in the final quiet. There are no notable line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("bruised twilight," "a wound" for each facet). The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to build tension towards the climax. A minor weakness is a slight redundancy in paragraph three, where two consecutive sentences ("He wasn't merely trying to fix a machine..." and "His life's work was...") restate the core motivation, a small loop that momentarily slows the otherwise powerful momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("lightning spiderwebbed"). However, there is a minor but persistent tendency toward elevated abstraction ("symphony of the collective memory," "chasm of the unknown") that can feel slightly overwritten. The final paragraph also shifts into a more summary-like mode, telling the reader what Kael now understands, which slightly dulls the immediacy of the preceding climax.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, with rhythm and syntax that support the story’s contemplative, focused mood. Figurative language, such as the "gravity of hopelessness," is purposeful and sharp. The line-level craft is nearly flawless, showing immense control and contributing significantly to the story's powerful atmosphere and clarity of vision.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, controlled, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence layering imagery, character, and theme. Figurative language, such as the cicada's wings "veined like fossilized leaves," is both beautiful and purposeful. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting; its momentum is generated by the sheer quality of its line-level craft, creating a reading experience that is both smooth and deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with very few wasted words. Figurative language, such as "a green and living tendril unfurling in the barren soil of his fear," is consistently strong and integrated. The sentence structure varies to control momentum, slowing for introspection and shortening for the physical struggle of the ascent. It is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. Sentences are crafted with care, creating a clear and evocative reading experience. The piece avoids clutter and redundancy. Its only minor flaw is a slight reliance on abstract labels in key moments, such as "a fluidly logical instrument," which tells the reader about a quality rather than embedding it purely in action. This is a small imperfection in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece of prose.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a confident rhythm. Lines like "a ghost of ambition, a tableau of failure" are particularly effective. The piece avoids major artifacts, but there is a slight over-reliance on compound descriptors ("memory-less depths," "data-rich fruit," "data-sealer") that occasionally clusters, slightly reducing the prose's momentum in favor of dense description.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language in the opening paragraphs is high, bordering on overwriting (e.g., "ashen charcoal sanctuary," "skeletal remains," "festering char"). While the language is beautiful, a more varied rhythm with moments of plainer statement could have heightened the impact of the most powerful images. No technical errors are present.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and maintains excellent momentum. It demonstrates high information density, with lines like "a reminder that some things were built to withstand pressure, not just create it" doing significant character and thematic work. While a few phrases like "guttural cry born of old rage and new hope" lean slightly on stock constructions, the overall craft is very strong, with varied sentence structures and a sure rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative from the first sentence to the last. Word choices like "quiet attrition" and "bled through the tall, arched windows" are precise and atmospheric. There is no wasted language; every description serves to build the mood or advance the ritual. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the action, from the slow, steady turning of the crank to the sudden, ringing silence of the climax. The piece is free of overwriting, loops, or other artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences like "The very air grew thin, stretching and snapping as reality shifts began to fray the edges of his sanctuary" demonstrate high-level craft. However, a few phrases lean into abstraction where concrete detail would be stronger (e.g., "factually mystical," "untethered and immaculate"). While there are no significant artifacts or loops, a final polish to ground some of the more conceptual language in the climax could elevate the prose even further.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, concise, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language, such as the silence being a “heavy blanket,” is effective and integrated without being overwrought. The line-level craft is nearly flawless, with high information density and clear propulsion. A couple of sentences lean slightly toward summarizing an internal state ("This was precisely the kind of unknown history she lived to find...") but this is a minor fault in an otherwise impeccable execution.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and a controlled, evocative rhythm. Sentences like "The silence not as an absence of sound, but as a pressure change in her tiny apartment" and "a language of coded freedom, written in ephemeral ink" are both beautiful and functional. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating a masterful command of line-level craft that serves the story's atmosphere and momentum perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and highly effective, with high information density and evocative figurative language ("parasitic melody," "stone teeth"). However, a few moments slightly undermine its perfection. The phrase "a feeling that he was protecting a memory more than a future" veers close to abstract summary in a story that otherwise excels at showing. While the overall quality is exceptional, these minor instances of telling rather than embodying prevent it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by precise, evocative language and a controlled, elegant rhythm. Sentences are information-dense without feeling overwritten, balancing beautiful figurative language ("a lone star in a field of gray") with simple, direct statements at key moments ("He had to prod it."). The piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative. Line-level craft is excellent, with varied sentence structures creating a compelling rhythm that guides the reader through discovery and contemplation. Word choice is precise and imagery is strong ("skeletal dome," "phantom galaxies"). The piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a high degree of authorial control.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, the final paragraph shifts slightly from showing to telling, summarizing the thematic realization ("He finally understood...") that the preceding image of the coin had already powerfully conveyed. This is a minor slip that slightly dulls the momentum of an otherwise impeccable final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong, clear verbs. Sentences like "He had to pursue the spirit through the very structure of its sonic despair" are exceptionally crafted. The piece is marred only by the single passage that explains the theme, which reads as scaffolding and momentarily halts the narrative momentum with unnecessary telling.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates a high level of craft with virtually no wasted words. The figurative language ("anesthesia evaporated like a ghost," "decanted into a hostile dreamscape") is consistently strong and supports the surreal, high-concept tone. While the language is elevated, it remains anchored to the character's voice and avoids overwriting, propelling the narrative with a controlled, rhythmic momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, concise, and demonstrates high information density. The sentence structure varies to control rhythm, particularly during the climactic "unfastening." Figurative language, like the reef as a "broken tooth," is sharp and effective. The description of the climax ("a silent, wrenching pull, not of thread but of reality itself") borders on the abstract but succeeds within the established magical context.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, concise, and evocative. Information density is high, with sentences like “Silence crashed down, thick and absolute,” performing multiple functions of setting, atmosphere, and plot advancement. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought figurative language. The rhythm and syntax are controlled, accelerating slightly with the discovery and settling into a calm cadence at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, precise, and demonstrates a high level of craft, with varied rhythms and dense, evocative imagery. Sentences are constructed with purpose and propulsion. A single line near the end—"The system was overloaded with a truth it was designed to exclude: that all moments are one moment"—borders on an overt thematic statement, slightly thinning the veil of subtext at a crucial moment, but it's a minor flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is consistently strong, favoring evocative, specific language ("gilded filigree," "pearlescent light," "chiseled spires") that builds the world and atmosphere simultaneously. The sentences are varied in structure and rhythm, reading aloud with a natural cadence. While highly figurative, the language never feels overwrought; instead, it serves the baroque theme and the poetic perspective of the protagonist, demonstrating high information density without a single wasted word or image.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly polished. Word choice is consistently strong and evocative ("milky-white shard," "sullen grey," "tinkersong wonder"). Sentence structure is varied, creating a rhythm that supports the story's quiet, determined momentum. While the language is elevated, it avoids becoming overwritten, staying true to the established mythic tone. There are no notable textual artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is luminous and precise for most of the story, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. However, the final paragraph drifts slightly into telling, summarizing the thematic shift (“her purpose had not been to capture the scent, but to understand its impossibility”). This moment of summary, while clear, slightly dulls the resonant power of the final image, preventing the prose from achieving a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few abstract phrases like "scaffold complexity with simplicity" and "visual representation of timewoven alliances" feel more like authorial concepts than the character's organic thoughts. This minor register drift slightly detaches the reader in key moments of discovery and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there is a recurring tendency towards overwriting with dense adjectival phrases ("magnificent rose window," "breathtaking, silent story," "profound, umbral tenderness"). These moments, while tonally consistent, slightly blunt the precision and momentum of an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, concise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. The rhythm and syntax shift effectively between the placid calm of the zeppelin and the violent transition into the reverie. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or plot advancement. The language is consistently precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative from the first sentence. Word choice is impeccable, and the rhythm of the sentences supports the story's somber, focused mood. The writing achieves a high information density without feeling cluttered, and there are no discernible prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding. Figurative language, such as the "skeletons of lanterns," is fresh and integral to the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and precise, with no wasted words or motion. Figurative language like "a velvet disquiet" and "thin and brittle as desiccated leaves" is vivid and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The sentence structure varies to control momentum, building from methodical description to the sharp, clear horror of the final realization. There are no discernible prose artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with high information density. While most of the figurative language is effective ("a living anchor in a sea of entropy"), a few images like "snowflakes on a warm tongue" feel slightly less fresh than the surrounding concepts. The overall execution is very strong, with excellent rhythm and no significant artifacts, but a handful of near-clichés prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, concise, and often beautiful, with high information density in nearly every line. Sentence structures vary to control rhythm, accelerating with the countdown and holding on key images. A few phrases verge on being slightly overwrought (e.g., "full, ferocious power"), but there are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a clean and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with a high density of information and imagery in each line. Figurative language, such as the star's light becoming a "final brushstroke," is both beautiful and purposeful. The rhythmic variation is excellent, building momentum into the climax and settling into a quiet cadence at the end. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the craft is clean and confident throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with powerful imagery. However, a few moments slightly undermine its excellence. The sentence "His motivation... had been a profound miscalculation" is an instance of telling an epiphany rather than embodying it in the moment. There's also a minor template-cadence run ("He had guarded... He believed... He thought...") that slightly flattens the rhythm in an otherwise strong paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and rhythmic, evocative sentences. Word choice is precise and figurative language is both original and coherent with the story's themes ("fishing in the great, silent ocean of the present"). There are no prose artifacts, loops, or wasted words; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and atmospheric density. The opening and closing lines are particularly powerful anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density and evocative, precise language. The prose is clean and propulsive within its lyrical mode. Minor scaffolding appears in moments that explain the character's process ("not as a puzzle to be solved, but as notes in a chord"), slightly over-directing the reader's interpretation of the central metaphor. While subtle, these instances hold the prose back from absolute perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density in every sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative ("viridian light," "synchronous exhalation"), and the syntax varies to match the story's rhythm. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought figurative language, resulting in a clean and impactful read.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Word choices like "luminous skeptic" and "existential vertigo" are both precise and evocative, doing significant character and thematic work. There is no overwriting or scaffolding; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere. The final line powerfully recharges the opening's tone, completing the story's aesthetic and thematic circuits.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and polished, demonstrating a high degree of rhythmic control and precision. Sentences are constructed for maximum impact, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Information density is high, with nearly every line serving character, world, and theme simultaneously. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the language is consistently clear, powerful, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is clean, confident, and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every sentence. The rhythm of the language is controlled, mirroring the story's pacing—from the static quiet of the opening to the steady momentum of the journey. A few phrases, like "intuitively descriptive question mark," feel slightly less organic than the surrounding text, as if reverse-engineered from a prompt, but these are minor blemishes on an otherwise polished and propulsive piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum effectively. The piece is held back from the highest tier only by a few instances where abstract summary ("Her motivation was simple yet vast") momentarily replaces the more powerful concrete description that characterizes the rest of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and highly atmospheric, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("A viridian nebula bled"). The sentence structure is varied, creating a rhythm that supports the story's blend of tension and reverence. While generally concise, a few phrases lean towards abstraction ("a perfect expression of cautious abandon") where a more concrete depiction might have been stronger. Overall, the line-level craft is polished and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, concise, and highly evocative from the first sentence to the last. Information density is high, with lines like "a click that echoed like a breaking bone" doing double duty for action and atmosphere. While a few images approach familiarity (e.g., "cracking like fine porcelain"), the overall execution is so clean and propulsive that it remains in the highest echelon of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, propelling the narrative forward. A minor deduction is warranted for the slightly declarative nature of the epiphany ("She understood now. Home was not...") which verges on telling, though it is immediately grounded in the subsequent imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the description of Elias’s thought process. Syntax and rhythm are varied and controlled to match the narrative's deliberate pace. Some figurative language ("thick chaff of his suffocating guilt") and descriptive phrases ("petrified stone lip") feel slightly conventional for this level of execution, preventing a top-tier score, but there are no significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. However, a minor slip into abstraction—"The attribute of her performance was its disarming playfulness"—briefly tells what the rest of the paragraph shows more effectively. While a very small flaw, it slightly disrupts the otherwise seamless momentum in a story operating at this high level.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with vivid, precise imagery ("cartography of its ruin," "tapestry of resilience"). However, a few moments verge on being overly explicit in their symbolism, such as calling the leviathan "the physical embodiment of the oblivion." While minor, these instances slightly reduce the otherwise superb subtlety, preventing a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm, and word choice is consistently strong (e.g., "a mouth weary of speaking," "a final transference of heat"). There are no wasted words or technical flaws; every line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or the accumulative emotional weight of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional—clean, dense, and evocative. Figurative language is powerful and precise ("predawn bruise," "gentle scream of pure longing") without ever feeling overwritten. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the story's momentum, from sharp, declarative setup to the long, focused intensity of the climax. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the advancement of the central act.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with nearly every sentence doing significant work to build atmosphere and character. Word choice is precise and evocative, avoiding cliché while maintaining clarity. While the figurative language is consistently rich, it remains just shy of becoming overwrought, skillfully supporting the mythic tone. The piece is impeccably clean, with no loops or scaffolding to dull its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often evocative and precise. However, the momentum is significantly hampered by the large blocks of reflective backstory in the second and third paragraphs, which exceed the standard allowance and lean more towards summary than dramatization. This exposition, while necessary for context, slows the forward action in the present scene, creating a noticeable drag before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with striking images like the lighthouse beam as a "metronome for his thoughts." However, two moments slightly mar the otherwise exceptional line-level craft. The phrase "a phenomenon he called borrowed memories" is an expository label that disrupts the immersive tone, and "The gaps told the real story" is a touch too explicit, summarizing a theme the narrative was already beautifully demonstrating.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and evocative, with high information density and strong, specific imagery ("patience of a glacier," "liquid clock," "petals translucent as moth wings"). The rhythm is well-paced and sentences are crafted with care. The piece would be in the highest tier, but for a moment of slight over-explication at the climax, where the prose summarizes the thematic insight ("...a mirror reflecting the validity of the single path taken") instead of relying purely on image and action.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with powerful imagery and a confident rhythm. However, a few minor artifacts slightly mar the finish. The repetition of the phrase "lacy menace" and the slightly over-explicit internal summary ("This was the grotto’s promise... This was the meaning...") momentarily break the spell of an otherwise masterful piece, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong verbs. However, a few phrases like "directed spontaneity" and "palette of resolve" feel slightly abstract and writerly, momentarily breaking the otherwise concrete texture. While the majority of the prose is exceptional, these minor instances of register drift in key moments hold it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is polished and professional. The prose demonstrates high information density and sentence-level propulsion without feeling overwritten. Word choice is precise and evocative ("splintered fragments," "obscene" hope). There are no discernible prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding. The opening line is an immediate hook, and the final line provides a strong sense of closure through action. The piece is clean, confident, and demonstrates a strong authorial ear for rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—precise, evocative, and dense with meaning. Figurative language, such as grief being "part of his bone structure," is both original and emotionally exact. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold; every sentence propels the narrative forward while deepening the atmosphere, resulting in a piece that is both elegant and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density in nearly every line. Figurative language, such as the affliction being a "latticework of old pains and future fears," is purposeful and sharpens our understanding of the character's state. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its descriptions ("the silent anticipation of the chainsaws"). The rhythm modulates effectively, moving from the "held breath" of the opening to the crackling intensity of the climax. A few figurative phrases, like "gravel wrapped in silk," border on the familiar, but this is a hairline slip in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with many memorable phrases ("plenum of resolution"). However, a few sentences drift toward abstract explanation rather than embodied experience, such as "To see history end was one thing; to comprehend the placid machinery of its conclusion was another entirely." This minor tendency to state the theme dilutes the otherwise immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language ("a deviation that felt like a tectonic flaw," "tolerances thinner than thought"). The prose is clean and propulsive, achieving a literary effect without a single overwrought sentence or mixed metaphor. The final paragraph is a perfect crescendo, building to a conclusion that is both intellectually and emotionally resonant, demonstrating complete mastery of rhythm and syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, concise, and often beautiful, demonstrating high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Word choice is precise and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. There are no loops or redundancies. A few phrases lean toward the abstract ("revolutionize the very concept of a security perimeter"), but this is a minor quibble in an otherwise flawlessly executed piece of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentences are beautifully constructed, with varied rhythms that propel the narrative forward ("a pilgrimage guided by vandals and ghosts"). There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every word serves the story's character, atmosphere, and momentum with remarkable efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates exceptionally high information density; nearly every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Word choice is precise and evocative, with conceptual phrases like "semantic engineer" and "delicate architecture" landing with poetic force. The piece avoids nearly all prose artifacts, though a line like "This was the core of the method" feels a touch more explanatory than the rest of the highly-wrought prose, a minuscule seam in an otherwise flawless garment.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally slips into abstraction or slightly overwritten phrasing, such as "the chemical covenant between her craft and the lost memory" or "the physical remnant of a regenerated covenant of love." These moments, while articulate, momentarily replace concrete action with conceptual labels, slightly diminishing the prose's overall immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and highly efficient. Lines like "He couldn't ship fellowship in a box. He had to catalyze it" display impressive information density and flair. The rhythm of the sentences is varied and purposeful, creating a momentum that feels both melancholic and hopeful. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every word serves the story's tone and progression with precision and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. However, a few minor blemishes prevent a top-tier score. Phrases like "a pure, unwavering beacon" and a melody that "resonated in his bones" dip into more conventional, slightly stock language, momentarily softening the otherwise sharp and specific texture of the prose. These are minor slips but are noticeable in an otherwise flawless piece.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is clean, confident, and possesses a high information density. Sentences like "He was a celestial signal interpreter, a title both grand and modest for a man who spent his cycles listening to the static between stars" establish character, setting, and tone with remarkable efficiency. There are no notable loops or scaffolding, and the language maintains its clarity and propulsion through the story’s emotional climax.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, confident, and highly evocative, with a rhythm that matches the character's deliberate, graceful movements. Sentences are crafted for high information and emotional density ("His camera a divining rod for oblivion"). The piece is remarkably clean, free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, allowing the strange beauty of the core concept to shine through with clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language, particularly the central fire/volcano metaphor, is coherent and effective. A few familiar phrasings ("worn smooth as worry stones") and a slight paraphrase loop in the final paragraph are minor artifacts that prevent a higher score but do not significantly impede the story's power.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by precision, elegance, and high information density. Metaphors are fresh and potent, from the opening line's "braided it into her marrow" to the closing image of the "duet for one." The sentences are rhythmically varied and impeccably constructed, propelling the narrative forward while simultaneously deepening the atmosphere. There are no wasted words, loops, or line-level artifacts; the craft is virtually flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms. The opening paragraph is particularly outstanding. A minor flaw appears in the final paragraph, which slightly pulls away from the immediate scene to summarize the future impact of Silas's victory ("A whisper of his victory would now snake..."). This momentary shift into summary slightly softens the otherwise sharp, in-the-moment closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong control of imagery. However, a few key phrases come across as overwrought or as conceptual labels rather than earned descriptions. The adverb "spiralingly" is an awkward and repeated invention, and phrases like "an act of silent empathy" summarize the feeling rather than letting the action carry the full weight. These instances slightly mar an otherwise polished piece by telling the reader the theme directly, pulling away from the powerful showing elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with many powerful phrases ("forests of second thoughts," "a shared whisper made visible"). The rhythm is controlled, and the story avoids significant clutter or redundancy. A few phrases, such as "a constant, static-filled broadcast only he could receive," have a slightly more functional, less lyrical feel than the surrounding prose, representing a hairline slip in an otherwise excellent performance.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and concise, with strong verbs and specific imagery that builds a vivid world with economy. Sentences like "her boots thudding with a comforting solidity he found suffocating" do excellent double duty for character and setting. A minor flaw is the line that explains the scrimshaw's magic ("it unlocks guarded hearts..."), a moment of telling that briefly interrupts the otherwise strong "show, don't tell" execution.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically sophisticated. Every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, or theme with high information density. Figurative language, such as “curls of wood that fell like whispers” and the turbines as an “uncaring heart,” is both beautiful and functional. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding or line-level artifacts, demonstrating a complete command of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. Sentences like "He was paraphrasing the tectonic shift into a line break, the slow crystallization of minerals into the weight of a syllable" are both beautiful and conceptually critical. The prose is clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding, and its rhythmic quality supports the story's quiet, immersive momentum from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Sentences are well-crafted and propel the narrative forward without wasted words or overt scaffolding. The only minor weakness is the final, expository sentence, which breaks from the preceding line-level craft by telling instead of showing.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often poetic, with high information density. However, a few moments rely on slightly generic descriptors ("impossibly complex and breathtakingly beautiful") or telling phrases ("The texture of connection was a real, physical thing"). These are minor blemishes on an otherwise strong execution, but they slightly blunt the sharpness of key moments of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, the very high density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwriting, with metaphors stacked closely together. This stylistic choice, while consistent, slightly blunts the impact of key moments through sheer accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, striking figurative language ("each drop a momentary lens," "a digital fever that had broken"), and a controlled, elegant rhythm. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or thematic development. The clarity and precision of the language, especially in describing abstract concepts, is a signal achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and carries a high information density, with sentences that consistently serve character, plot, and atmosphere. The rhythm and syntax modulate effectively, moving from measured description to more breathless passages as the Aethel bleed into Elara. While rich with evocative language, it avoids becoming overwritten, maintaining clarity and momentum through to the poignant final line.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with figurative language that consistently deepens the story's core conceits. The line-level craft is nearly flawless. A minor, recurring structural tic of using adjacent clauses or sentences to paraphrase the same idea ("It wasn't an invader; it was a cage...") appears a few times, creating a slight drag on momentum but never obscuring meaning. This is a hairline flaw in an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("a silent, swirling ghost," "a silent mountain of patience"). Momentum is well-controlled, slowing for detailed work and quickening in moments of tension. A minor weakness is a tendency toward slightly over-polished or abstract phrasing in the final thematic summary, which reads less like organic prose and more like authorial statement, momentarily slowing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, polished, and propelled by strong verbs and potent, original metaphors ("cryptic archipelago," "psychic soil and rock").

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and evocative, with very few missteps. Figurative language like "the sky bled green and violet" and "cosmic plainsong" is consistently high-level and serves the story's tone of "shadowed rapture."

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, clear, and demonstrates high information density with strong, evocative imagery. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, modulating with the character's journey from disorientation to revelation. The writing is almost flawless, with only a minor tendency towards high-concept abstraction ("cartography of his own soul") that slightly distances the reader from the otherwise concrete world.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery and a controlled, elegant cadence. Sentences are constructed with care, creating momentum and atmosphere simultaneously. The primary weakness is the final paragraph's shift from showing to telling, a moment where the prose sacrifices artistry for explicit explanation, slightly dulling the sharpness of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, demonstrating high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, specific word choices.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful ("fish like shards of stained glass," "a phantom limb of the world").

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, concise, and demonstrates high line-level craft with varied syntax and strong, evocative verb choices. Figurative language, such as the "constellation of ghosts" and "frozen lightning," is effective and integrated well. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, and the final line provides a powerful, resonant cadence that recharges the opening's sense of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically rich, with powerful sentences like "dissolving like golden sugar into the water." However, a few moments near the climax slip into abstraction or summary ("It was no longer a simple potential; it was an active process"). These instances slightly blunt the momentum and immediacy of an otherwise sharp and propulsive piece, representing a minor missed opportunity for purely imagistic storytelling at the peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is outstanding: both lyrical and precise. Word choice is impeccable, and sentences are constructed for maximum rhythm and impact ("a cold and regular pulse in a world after the last lighthouse keeper"). There is high information density with zero scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is powerful and purposeful, enhancing the embodied experience without ever feeling overwritten. The line-level craft is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("flooded...with a blade's sharp edge"). While the line-level craft is exceptional, a few phrases like "predator's fluid grace" lean on familiar constructions, representing a hairline imperfection. Otherwise, the sentences are rhythmically varied and free of momentum-dragging artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, concise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in most lines. While generally superb, a few phrases like "a whirlwind of risk and resolve" or "placid ignorance" verge on being slightly overwrought, momentarily telling instead of showing. However, these are minor slips in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece that demonstrates strong command of language and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise language ("sun bled," "currency of fear," "a coffin for a future").

Sentence structures vary to create a lyrical rhythm that supports the story's tone without drawing attention to itself, demonstrating a polished and confident hand.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, beautiful, and dense with figurative language. While mostly successful, the sheer density occasionally verges on being overwrought, with nearly every sentence containing a metaphor or simile. This high-register intensity is sustained well but lacks the modulation that could make the peak moments even more impactful, creating a slight texture of uniformity rather than dynamic range.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often evocative, with high information density in its best moments ("a kingdom of ink and pulp," "satellites of sorrow"). The rhythm is well-paced and controlled. A minor but notable flaw is a tendency to summarize the effect of an action, as seen in "The logic was a cascade of failures," which tells the reader what to feel rather than letting the evidence itself create the collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and evocative, concise phrasing ("his needle a whisper against skin"). The prose maintains momentum while weaving in rich figurative language that builds atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The piece is free of distracting prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a disciplined and polished execution. The rhythm and syntax modulate effectively to match the story's emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative. There are, however, a few instances where the phrasing becomes slightly too self-aware or thematically explicit, such as calling the tile flake a "fossilized promise of resonance." While beautiful, this borders on labeling the subtext for the reader, a hairline crack in an otherwise impeccable surface that slightly dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and dense with meaning, particularly in its descriptions of the setting and the internal process. Sentences like "memory was a tyrant, and the only sane response to tyranny was its complete dismantling" are potent. The score is held just below the 9+ band by a few phrases that feel slightly too self-aware or declarative of the story's themes ("a mission to cradle empathy in arms of steel"), which momentarily reads more like an author's thesis than a character's thought.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical and precise for the vast majority of the story. However, the line "Her despair shattered like cheap glass" is a stock simile that momentarily breaks the spell of an otherwise highly original piece. This small artifact occurs at the story's emotional climax, preventing a higher score in an otherwise exemplary category.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative. Figurative language, such as hope like "spun glass" and a feeling like "shattering ice," is fresh and perfectly integrated, enhancing meaning without overwriting.

There is a high information density with no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The sentence-level craft is generally high, though the repetition of "It was..." during the climactic description feels slightly more explanatory than poetic. The final paragraph's shift toward summary is a minor weakness in an otherwise polished piece, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. However, the final sentence, "he would deliver the power to write a new future," verges on thematic summary, slightly telling what the preceding actions have already powerfully shown. This minor slip in an otherwise strong closure beat prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The writing is mostly concise and avoids significant artifacts. However, a few moments rely on familiar phrasing ("quiet ache in his chest," "heart hammered against his ribs") that momentarily flatten the otherwise distinct texture, preventing a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is of the highest caliber. The prose is elegant, precise, and dense with meaning without ever feeling overwritten ("Its lamps carving feeble holes in the soupy white").

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, marked by strong verbs and evocative, precise imagery. The rhythm of the sentences effectively supports the story's contemplative and deliberate pace. The score is held back from the highest tier only by the final paragraphs, where the language becomes more declarative and explanatory, sacrificing some of the poetic propulsion that characterizes the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional: clean, evocative, and possessing a high information density where every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and action. Figurative language, such as the tooth becoming a "pendulum of light" or a "metallic bloom," is both beautiful and functional. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding or loops, and its sentence-level propulsion perfectly matches the deliberate, hypnotic rhythm of the central ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, evocative, and surgically precise. Every sentence works to advance the story's purpose, with no redundancy or overwriting. Figurative language, such as the "cataclysm of the soul" and "graveyard of his memory," is powerful yet controlled, while the syntax shifts to match the emotional intensity of the scene. The piece is virtually free of line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless, characterized by high information density and precise, evocative language ("spun from damp silk," "a constellation of human hearts").

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative from the first sentence. Word choice is consistently strong ("exhaled a cold, wet mist," "color of a fading bruise"), and figurative language is purposeful and integrated. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the action, moving from the deliberate and methodical to the sharp, incisive climax. There are no wasted words; information density is high, and the piece is free of loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is both elegant and efficient, characterized by high information density and evocative imagery like "wring a bucket of grey water" and "cartographical curse."

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Word choice is precise and imagery is sharp ("paper as fragile as a moth’s wing"). A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances of abstract summary in the final paragraph ("a translation of sorrow, of loss, of a shared cosmic loneliness") where a more concrete, embodied description would have been even more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and largely successful, with powerful, evocative lines like "her serenity a blade cutting through the psychic noise." However, a few phrases ("ashes of her grief," "shattered heart") lean towards familiar convention, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp and original language. While these minor slips do not harm the closure, they prevent the line-level craft from reaching absolute perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense, precise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery that build the world efficiently. The rhythm and syntax vary to match the scene's needs, creating a propulsive yet lyrical feel. There are a few moments where a phrase borders on being overly writerly (e.g., "desperate equation," "razor's edge... rising tide"), which slightly tempers the otherwise flawless execution, but these are minor and do not disrupt the story's powerful momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with each sentence contributing to character, atmosphere, or momentum. Figurative language, such as roots snaking "between the ribs of the long dead, drawing sustenance from their concluded stories," is purposeful and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with no discernible scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language ("gears of thought loosening like a relaxing fist") is both original and illuminating, enhancing meaning without becoming decorative. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the story's slow, deliberate pace, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, strong verbs, and evocative, precise imagery ("Light, thick as honey"). The prose maintains momentum and rhythm, modulating effectively for the moment of hesitation before the climax. While the language is rich, it avoids becoming overwrought, instead serving to heighten the mythological feel of the setting and events. There are no notable prose artifacts or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong, resonant metaphors like the accordion as a "broken lung." The line-level craft is generally excellent, maintaining momentum and clarity. There is a minor instance of conceptual redundancy in the final paragraph where the narration paraphrases the graffiti's meaning, slightly dulling the sharpness of the climactic insight.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with high information content in every sentence. Figurative language is not ornamental but fundamental to the story's world and logic, as in "the ghosts of syllables never uttered." The rhythm varies effectively, mirroring Elara's focused, methodical actions and her moments of trembling discovery. The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or other artifacts, showing immaculate line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is polished, dense, and displays exceptional control. Word choices are precise and evocative ("polishes thrones for a living," "perforated destiny"), and the sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm. The story is free of scaffolding or redundancy; every line contributes to character, atmosphere, or forward momentum, particularly in the resonant final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with strong verbs and carefully chosen imagery. However, it occasionally tips into being slightly overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel stacked. Phrases like "great, star-dusted oblivion" and "ghost-scent of forgotten memories" are beautiful but verge on being purple, and a minor paraphrase loop appears in the second paragraph ("Her purpose... her sacred duty"), slightly dulling the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, clear, and carries a strong rhythmic quality ("a vineyard hush, a silence not of emptiness but of slow, patient growth"). Sentence structure varies to match the pace of Elara's thoughts and actions. While the writing is largely excellent, the final paragraph's direct summary of the theme feels less like artful prose and more like an explanation, a minor artifact that slightly dulls an otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, concise, and highly evocative from the first sentence. Word choice is precise and imagery is strong without becoming overwrought ("surrendered its ghost of heat," "a scripture he’d suddenly forgotten how to read").

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, with strong imagery like "starlight was sharp enough to cut." Momentum is well-maintained, and sentences are information-dense. There are a few minor instances of telling over showing ("her core motivation laid bare") and a slightly cliché phrase ("weight of a library"), but these are minimal flaws that do not disrupt the story's powerful climax or overall polish.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, evocative, and purposeful.

The sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the story’s pacing, from the deliberate movement on the pier to the suspended stillness in the wreck. A few phrases verge on abstraction ("terrifying enormity"), but are always immediately grounded in concrete detail, preserving momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and confident, with phrases like “a crush of bruised light and screaming physics” establishing a high standard from the opening.

The balance between evocative, figurative language and clear, propulsive narration is expertly maintained through to the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and demonstrates high-level craft, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Information density is excellent, and the rhythm carries the reader effectively. However, a few phrases slightly diminish its exceptional quality by leaning on familiar constructions, such as "The sun bled out below the horizon" and the "apricot and violet" description of light. While beautiful, these moments lack the startling originality of the story's core concepts, preventing a higher score in this fiercely competitive category.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and purposeful, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Figurative language like "dawn bled across the horizon" and "a silence so profound it felt like a missing note" establishes atmosphere immediately without overwriting. The rhythm of the sentences shifts with the action, culminating in the spare, impactful description of the final chord and its tiny result. The craft is clean and highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density, particularly in the opening. The rhythm is well-controlled, moving from the atmospheric to the procedural with ease. A minor weakness is a few lines of self-summary that feel slightly less sharp than the surrounding prose, such as "the deep-seated motivation that had guided his vigil," which tells what has already been shown, momentarily slowing the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The language is precise and purposeful, especially in its descriptions of the setting and the climactic sublimation. However, a few phrases like "crystalline, logical clarity" or "impossibly, startlingly new" contain minor redundancies or stacked modifiers that could be tightened. The line "a feeling he’d read about but never known" is a moment of telling that slightly dulls the immediacy of his otherwise well-embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, confident, and demonstrates high information density. The opening and closing lines are particularly strong. While generally excellent, a few minor instances of telling language slightly soften the impact in the middle, such as "his attentively inventive nature kicking into gear." However, the syntax and rhythm propel the story forward effectively, especially in the tense final moments, and there are no significant line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and highly efficient, establishing a complex world and emotional landscape with impressive speed. Lines like "His gaze, honed by his condition, sliced through pretense with the ease of a blade through silk" are both beautiful and functional. While some phrasing borders on the abstract ("temporal static"), it serves the story's unique tone and atmosphere without impeding clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with strong verbs and specific imagery throughout. The rhythm is controlled and serves the story's contemplative pace. The piece is nearly flawless until the final line, where the phrase "a testament to the fact that..." introduces a moment of abstract, explanatory scaffolding. This minor lapse into telling what was already powerfully shown slightly dulls the resonance of the final image, a small but significant flaw at the story's most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and highly effective, with strong verbs ("macerate," "ripped") and precise, evocative language. The sentence structure varies to control pacing, especially in the sequence of starting the engine. A few phrases like "emblems of the family's neglect" lean slightly into telling, but these are minor slips in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density and a varied, compelling rhythm. Word choices are precise and evocative, contributing significantly to the atmosphere. The piece is remarkably clean, avoiding the loops, scaffolding, and figurative muddles that often plague descriptive prose, resulting in a narrative that feels both literary and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative for nearly the entire piece. However, the line "And that was when the penny drops" is a jarring colloquialism and register break in an otherwise elevated, literary voice. While it marks the story's crucial turning point, the cliché phrasing is the single most significant flaw, preventing a 9+ score in an otherwise masterful category.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Sentences are well-constructed with varied rhythms, and there are no notable loops or redundancies. The piece demonstrates a masterful command of language. The score is slightly tempered by the final paragraph's move towards summary, which, while more of a thematic issue, also flattens the prose's momentum in the story's final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("a bead of water skittering off a waxed leaf"). The rhythm is controlled and supports the story's momentum. A few minor instances of telling over showing ("His motivation crystallized then...") and a couple of slightly worn similes ("kicked in like a stubborn generator") are the only elements holding it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates exceptional information density without a single wasted word. Figurative language, such as the sinew thread being "realistically imaginary," is not decorative but foundational to the story's logic. The rhythm is controlled, accelerating with the character's frantic weaving and settling into a chilling stillness at the end, showcasing a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with not a single line feeling extraneous. Figurative language, such as the city domes as "phosphorescent barnacles," is vivid and purposeful.

The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops or artifacts to disrupt its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious, confident, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and a controlled rhythm. However, there is a recurring tendency toward slightly overwritten, self-consciously literary phrasing (e.g., "cartography of loss," "technician of sorrow"). While these establish voice, their density occasionally verges on distracting from the scene's emotional immediacy, preventing the line-level craft from being truly invisible and seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is of a very high caliber, marked by concision, strong verbs, and fresh, purposeful figurative language ("concrete wound," "fossilized leviathans").

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, concise, and demonstrates exceptional control. Figurative language is dense but purposeful, building the world and atmosphere without a single misplaced metaphor ("a river of black ink flowing through the air"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence drives the narrative forward with a potent combination of elegance and clarity. The final paragraph is a masterclass in landing a story with both precision and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, marked by high information density and evocative, precise imagery ("electric snow pouring from the earpiece," "sharp edges softening like wax near a flame"). There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every sentence serves to advance the narrative or deepen the atmosphere. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, contributing significantly to the story’s overall power.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-paced, building momentum effectively toward the climax. The piece loses a fraction of a point for leaning on a few familiar phrases ("poured more of herself into the music") and for a final paragraph whose descriptive density slightly lessens the impact of the final, crucial sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by a strong, confident rhythm. Word choices are precise and evocative, doing multiple jobs at once (e.g., "twilight bled across the sky, staining the clouds the color of a fading bruise"). The story demonstrates impeccable clarity and concision, with no wasted words or scaffolding. A few phrases lean towards the ornate ("impossible silver lightning"), but this is a minor affectation in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in nearly every line. Figurative language, such as the fragment being "spun moonlight," is fresh and tonally perfect. A few phrases during the climax, like "a feeling too vast for his chest," are slightly more conventional than the surrounding prose, representing a minor slip in an otherwise flawless execution. However, the overall rhythm, clarity, and propulsion are of the highest caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative without becoming overwritten. Information density is high, with sentences like "equations rhymed and nebulae were rendered in haiku" doing significant world-building work concisely. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; the syntax and rhythm modulate effectively to build tension towards the climax. The final line provides a perfect, quiet cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless, with very few wasted words. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic effect, such as "This was his ritual, his obsession, and his only hope." The language consistently serves character and atmosphere, avoiding overwriting despite its poetic quality. There are no notable loops or scaffolding artifacts; the propulsion from line to line is confident and clear, especially in the climactic scene.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with many powerful images. However, a few instances of telling weaken an otherwise stellar performance, such as describing a gesture as "unassumingly bold" or stating his posture "belying the immense power he was wielding." These moments of authorial summary slightly flatten the immediacy in what is intended to be a flawless piece, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in every line. The language creates a powerful atmosphere without ever feeling overwritten, even in its most figurative moments ("a cathedral of glass and rusted iron," "a silent, jagged corona"). Sentence structure and rhythm vary effectively, propelling the narrative forward to its quiet, resonant conclusion without any loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density and precise, evocative figurative language ("skin was a tapestry of fine, silvery scars," "calluses on the soul"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to build character, atmosphere, or momentum. The rhythm is varied and controlled, accelerating during Kael's agitated mapping and slowing to a deliberate pace in the final, resonant paragraph. It is a flawless execution of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, during the climactic ritual, the figurative language becomes extremely dense. While mostly effective ("the incandescent gold of a new idea"), it occasionally relies on slightly familiar phrasing ("his mind a gentle net"). This density is a high-wire act that largely succeeds but slightly impedes momentum at the story's most critical point, holding it back from true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few moments rely on slightly worn phrasing. "Settling between us like a shroud" and "a silent scream that echoed only in the soul" are minor clichés that stand out in otherwise stellar prose. These are hairline slips, but in a piece this controlled, they prevent a perfect score by momentarily breaking the unique texture of the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and dense with meaning, achieving a literary quality from the first sentence. Word choices are impeccable, and figurative language, such as the henge being a "whispered chapel" sealed by the "camouflage of time," is both beautiful and functional. The piece is free of scaffolding or redundancy, displaying a clean, confident craft that propels the quiet narrative forward with assured momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and often beautiful, especially in its descriptions of the underwater scene ("pages swollen into pale, indecipherable flowers"). The rhythm is measured and controlled, propelling the narrative with quiet momentum. A minor weakness appears in the final thematic explanation, where the prose shifts from evocative description to a more academic, declarative register. This slight register drift, while purposeful, lessens the poetic force of the conclusion slightly, but the overall line-level craft remains very high.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating both elegance and high information density. Sentences are crafted with precision and rhythm, creating momentum without a single wasted word or clunky construction. There are no loops or overwritten passages; even the most figurative language, like "a whisper in the courtyard’s atmospheric architecture," serves to build the world and deepen the emotional stakes with flawless clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clear, evocative, and largely efficient, with strong forward momentum. The sentence structure varies nicely, and the pacing within the elevator ride is excellent. There are a few moments where the prose could be tighter, such as the slightly redundant "He was an ascending servant, yet he was leaving the only person he had truly served behind." These minor instances of scaffolding prevent a higher score but do not significantly impede the story's powerful effect.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—elegant, concise, and rhythmically flawless. Each sentence carries significant weight, advancing character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, from the mooring line snapping with "a sound no louder than a sigh" to the final cloud's "cosmic emotion played out across a hundred miles." There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought passages; the craft is invisible and immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative from the opening sentence. Word choice is consistently strong ("cerulean light bled," "fractally precise veins"), and the rhythm of the sentences effectively modulates the tension. The piece demonstrates exceptional economy, with every description and action serving to advance the plot, character, or atmosphere without a single wasted word. There are no notable prose artifacts or momentum-draining loops.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence serving multiple functions. Imagery like "sun’s fire bled from the horizon" and the "silent, chaotic ballet" of the starlings is vivid and purposeful. The piece is exceptionally clean, with the only minor blemish being the slightly common phrasing of a "lightning strike" realization, a hairline flaw in otherwise immaculate craft.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely free of artifacts. Word choice is precise and evocative, and the syntax varies to create a compelling rhythm that carries the narrative forward. While the language is highly stylized and occasionally risks becoming overwrought, it remains coherent and purposeful, supporting the story's fantastical, solemn atmosphere without obscuring the clarity of action, particularly in the critical final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is strong, with concise and often evocative prose that maintains momentum. Sentences are well-structured, and there are no significant prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding. The description of the bell's effect—"It didn't chime; it resonated"—is an excellent example of precise word choice creating a powerful and clear image that drives the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often luminous and precise, with a strong rhythmic control. However, the third paragraph contains a clear template-cadence run ("This was his purpose... He was not a herald... His motivation was not...") that feels mechanical. Similarly, some figurative language in the climax, while ambitious ("delicate surgery on the soul of history"), slightly overwrites the moment, briefly pulling focus from the clean emotional line. These artifacts prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative ("a filigree of impending doom," "subsonic frequency"), and sentence structures are varied to control rhythm effectively. There is no overwriting or scaffolding; every line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language, like the nut being a "drop of solidified night," is fresh and deepens the story's unique magical system and tone without feeling ornate.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm is controlled and serves the contemplative mood well. The score is held back from the highest tier by a few minor instances of cliché or slightly overwrought phrasing (e.g., "its lightness a profound weight," "slow, widening dawn").

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly polished, with a high density of meaning in each line. Figurative language is consistently purposeful and illuminating ("a quiet island of polished emptiness," "a patient cartography of the void"). There are no wasted words or movements, and the rhythm of the sentences effectively supports the story's quiet, methodical momentum, building to a luminous and impactful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and flawlessly controlled. Figurative language is consistently striking and purposeful ("shell ridged like a petrified thumbprint," "peeled back the sand like a scab"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence drives the story forward while simultaneously building atmosphere and character. The line-level precision is truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong imagery and rhythm. The information density is high, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The score is held back by minor instances of telling over showing, such as describing his grace as “both vigorous and tender” instead of letting the actions alone convey this. The thematic summary in the final paragraph is also a prose-level flaw, sacrificing evocative imagery for direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking imagery, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. However, there are minor moments where stylized phrases feel slightly overwrought or repetitive. The repetition of "chaotically precise" and the abstractness of "quaking reverie" slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution, preventing a 9+ score, but the overall craft remains at a very high level.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("clinging to the stone arch like silver pearls"). It maintains momentum and clarity throughout, with no significant loops or artifacts. The final paragraph leans slightly toward summarizing Kael's newfound feeling, a minor tell that keeps it just shy of the 9+ band, but the final image remains powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and economical, with high information density in every line. Figurative language, such as silence as a "weight...in her bones" and stress cracks as a "score," is both original and integral to the story's logic. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the quiet, deliberate pace of Elara's actions, building momentum cleanly through the performance to the final, resonant pause. There are zero technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding; it is polished to a flawless finish.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant, with a strong rhythmic control and high information density. However, the story dedicates a significant portion of its opening to reflection and backstory, which slightly dulls the initial momentum before the compelling scene work begins. While this exposition is well-written and functional, its proportion is high for such a short piece, briefly delaying the active process of discovery. The prose in the second half, describing the process and climax, is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. The descriptions are specific and purposeful, especially in the crucial tuning sequence. Word choice and sentence rhythm effectively modulate the story's tension. A few phrases in the opening paragraph lean slightly abstract and expository ("a key to understanding the unspoken heart of existence"), but this is a minor weakness in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences are beautifully constructed with varied rhythms, and word choice is precise and evocative ("malodorous bloom," "quiescent life"). There are no filtering, scaffolding, or looping artifacts. The only slight awkwardness is the verb "journalize," which is a minor point in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is a masterclass in economy and evocative power. Line-level craft is impeccable, with high information density and a varied, compelling rhythm. Figurative language like "liquid road" and "whirling silence" is fresh and precise. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to momentum and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Sentences are well-constructed, creating a propulsive and atmospheric read. A minor weakness is a slight tendency towards abstraction in the final explanation ("wave of pure cessation," "signal that simply turned everything off"), which feels less concrete than the masterful setup. This brief summary-like quality in the climax is the only element holding the prose back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with high information density, especially in its sensory descriptions ("a wave of verdant light that tasted of new grass"). However, there are occasional moments where the elevated diction feels slightly stiff or bureaucratic, such as the verb "certify," which clashes with the otherwise organic and mythic tone. The final paragraph also contains a degree of summary that feels less propelled than the action preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. The prose is clean, with no verbal scaffolding or repetitive sentence structures. While phrases like "avalanchingly quiet" are ambitious and largely effective, they border on being slightly self-conscious, a hairline flaw in an otherwise impeccable performance.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep. Figurative language is consistently original and effective, from light held "like honey in a jar" to ink that "shimmered like a captured nebula." There are no loops, scaffolding, or register drift; every sentence serves to build the story's unique atmosphere and propel its strange, mesmerizing logic forward.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Lines like "a garden of frozen light blooming in the heart of the desolate winter" are memorable and precise. While a few phrases like "unnervingly loud" or "testament to the nervous rhythm" lean slightly toward convention, the overall craft is very strong, with varied sentence structures and a rhythm that supports the story's emotional progression without a single distracting artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is clean, dense, and propulsive. Every word is purposeful, with precise and evocative diction ("impassive," "confluence," "desolate") building atmosphere and character simultaneously. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the sentences move with a deliberate rhythm that mirrors Elias's own solemn methodology, culminating in a final paragraph of stark, ringing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates high-level craft in its rhythm and word choice. The information density is excellent. However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, occasionally bordering on overwrought, which slightly mutes the impact of the most critical images. A touch more restraint would allow the truly exceptional metaphors to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong momentum. Lines like "He worked not with iron, but with hope, a far more stubborn material" are superb. A minor deduction is for a slight over-reliance on certain keywords ("quiet," "defiant") in the final paragraph, which slightly diminishes the otherwise flawless finish.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and propulsive, with high information density and a varied sentence rhythm that supports the story's mood. Word choice is precise and evocative. There are no technical flaws, loops, or overwriting; every line serves a clear purpose in advancing the narrative or deepening the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and concise, with high information density in every line. The language is consistently evocative without ever becoming overwrought, as seen in phrases like "a language of balance and form" and "the pain of an ending he never saw coming." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the mechanics are invisible, allowing the story’s emotional weight to be carried by clean, strong, and rhythmic sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, with many striking and original images like "a bruise of violet and churning silver." However, in moments of peak action, there's a tendency towards overwriting, stacking grand phrases like "narrative of collapse and rebirth...forged in this beautiful, violent crucible." While the rhythm and clarity are strong, this occasional lack of restraint slightly dulls the impact of otherwise powerful sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative tone, and figurative language ("a silent detonation of perception," "sliver of impossible sky") is fresh and effective. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other prose artifacts that would impede momentum, particularly in the crucial final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, demonstrating high information density without a single wasted word. The figurative language ("quantified sorrow," "shed grief like pollen") is original and seamlessly integrated, enhancing atmosphere without feeling ornate. The sentences have a varied, compelling rhythm that propels the narrative forward, and there are no instances of scaffolding, loops, or overwritten passages, even during the climactic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery. However, there are minor instances where momentum is slightly dulled by telling rather than showing, such as the direct summary of her motivation in the second paragraph. This, combined with a subtle paraphrase loop in the fifth paragraph, represents a small friction in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythm and clarity. However, a few moments rely on slightly familiar phrasing that softens the impact ("heart a frantic bird against his ribs," "silent clarity of a sunrise"). While the overall quality is very high and there are no significant loops or artifacts, these minor instances of conventional imagery prevent the line-level craft from reaching the flawless execution seen elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and concise, with high information density in nearly every line. Word choice is precise and evocative ("a fossil from a forgotten age," "a tenuous absolution"). While the piece is free of technical flaws, the final paragraph’s slight tendency toward thematic summary over pure scene slightly dulls the propulsive momentum built up to that point, a hairline fissure in an otherwise masterful performance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, evocative imagery, and a confident, varied rhythm. Lines like "a cartographer of a collapsing reality" and "a symphony collapsing into discordant noise" are both beautiful and functionally precise. There are no wasted words, loops, or clunky constructions; every sentence serves to advance the narrative and deepen the atmosphere with clarity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is largely exceptional—dense, rhythmic, and clear, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, a single line in the climax—"her attribute of being curiously steadfast shining through"—briefly slips into telling rather than showing. This minor piece of authorial scaffolding slightly mars an otherwise flawless execution by over-explaining a trait the character is already demonstrating through action.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, precise, and beautiful without becoming overwrought. Word choice is consistently strong, and the sentence-level propulsion is excellent, creating a slow, deliberate rhythm that matches the tone. There are no discernible text artifacts, loops, or scaffolding. The information density is high, with nearly every sentence serving character, atmosphere, and the advancement of the central idea simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in every line. Sentences like “a single tear traced a clean path through the charcoal dust on his cheek, catching the cavern's light like a falling star” are both beautiful and purposeful. While a few phrases like "auroral sorrow" are slightly self-conscious, the overall craft is exceptional, with no wasted words or momentum-dragging artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, with high information density and no wasted words. Figurative language, such as "sweet poison on the recycled air" or "a nest of shredded parchment," is vivid and purposeful. The sentences have a varied, elegant rhythm that propels the narrative forward, and there are no signs of scaffolding, loops, or other line-level artifacts, even in the moments of revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery ("thin as frozen tears"). However, a few minor moments slightly dull the effect, such as the explanatory phrase "the sonic vibrations resonated through its form" or the concluding summary, "His muteness was not a lack, but a space he filled with symphonies." These instances of telling rather than showing are infrequent but prevent the prose from achieving absolute flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and specific imagery driving the narrative. Lines like "I am no longer a gardener; I am a crucible" are exceptional. The piece is remarkably free of scaffolding or redundancy. A minor deduction is made for a few phrases that lean toward familiar convention, such as "screaming crescendo," which slightly dull the otherwise sharp and original line-level craft in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and demonstrates good rhythm, particularly in the opening. However, the final sentence is a significant flaw, functioning as a scaffolding loop that restates content already proven by the action. There is also a minor reliance on familiar metaphors ("tear in the community's fabric," "knot had formed"). While the line-level craft is mostly strong, these elements prevent it from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative and precise language. However, the momentum is slightly dulled in the final paragraphs by sentences that summarize emotional and thematic arcs rather than letting them remain embodied. The line, "a poem of her own making that encrypted her entire journey here—her hope, her solitude, her quiet rebellion," is a list of abstractions that tells instead of shows, a minor but noticeable flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, evocative and original figurative language ("curdling from peace into a shared, held breath"), and a strong, consistent rhythm. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. The clarity and concision at the line level are of a publishable, professional standard, particularly in the charged climax and quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely excellent, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. There is a very minor paraphrase loop in the second paragraph ("smoothed hush, an active and pervasive quiet"), which slightly dulls an otherwise sharp sentence. However, the overall quality, syntactic variety, and high information density demonstrate a masterful command of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is consistently elegant and precise, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is fresh and effective (e.g., "a silhouette stitched from twilight," "celestial chalk marks on a vast blackboard"). The story avoids scaffolding or redundancy; the pacing is controlled by varied sentence structure and a strong sense of rhythm. There are no distracting line-level artifacts, resulting in a smooth and immersive reading experience where the craft serves the story perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a few moments exhibit a slight register drift where the interiority becomes overly analytical for a crisis moment (e.g., "a trick of psycho-acoustics, a phantom limb of the psyche"). This, along with a high density of figurative language in the opening, slightly weighs down the otherwise clean and propulsive line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with a high density of information and evocative imagery. However, a couple of lines lean slightly into authorial summary, momentarily breaking the otherwise seamless POV. Phrases like "He was wisely enduring the immense pressure" and "so must he work: with deliberation, with inevitability" state the character's condition and theme rather than purely embodying it, a minor but noticeable slip in an otherwise stellar piece.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong, confident rhythm. The line-level craft is nearly flawless, though a few moments rely on high-level abstractions ("a chord of immense power and profound sadness") or slightly worn constructions ("as tangled as the canyons before her") that stand out against the otherwise stellar precision.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by high information density, striking imagery, and a controlled, elegant rhythm. Figurative language, such as the man being a "human eclipse," is both original and precise. The sentences are crafted with care, showing zero evidence of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, propelling the narrative with clarity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and precise word choice. Sentences are constructed with a clear sense of rhythm that supports the story's quiet, deliberate pacing. There are no wasted words, loops, or clunky constructions. The figurative language, such as the city's "stone arteries" or the fireflies' "living loom," is fresh and integral to the story's thematic web.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, confident, and highly efficient, characterized by precise word choice and strong, varied sentence structures. Lines like "a place where the zone of life met the zone of death with unsettling precision" establish tone and stakes with remarkable economy. The writing is free of overwriting, scaffolding, or rhythmic monotony, propelling the narrative forward with clarity and understated grace.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. The language is consistently elevated without feeling overwritten, creating a powerful sense of atmosphere. A slight deduction is for the final paragraph, where naming the tone "gritty whimsy" and summarizing his new state feels a touch less graceful than the preceding scene-work, bordering on telling what was already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and strong verbs. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it borders on being overwrought in places, slightly slowing momentum. More critically, the final paragraph uses a summary cadence ("His work was done, his lonesome splendor a conduit..., his small existence justified...") which reads like scaffolding and slightly dulls the power of the final image by telling what was just shown.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, in the high-pressure climax, the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought and dense, as seen in the description of the tone as "fleshly ethereal" and the complex sentence about blood cells realigning. These moments, while aiming for effect, momentarily sacrifice the clarity and propulsion demonstrated elsewhere, representing a minor flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, especially in the climactic moments. The score is held just below the 9+ band due to a few instances of abstract summary ("The entire tone of their uprising was one of restrained wildness") that function as minor prose artifacts, telling the reader what could be inferred from the action and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptionally clean, with high information density and a strong, forward-moving rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative without ever feeling overwritten, even in moments of heightened atmosphere. There are no discernible text artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves a clear purpose in advancing character, atmosphere, or plot, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density, with sentences frequently doing multiple jobs. Phrasing like "swallowed by the vibrant hush" and "the patient focus of a craftsman" is precise and evocative. The piece is commendably free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, allowing the central images to land with clarity and force. The rhythm of the prose mirrors the story's emotional arc, moving from somber deliberation to a quiet, dawning clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, precise, and evocative, with very few wasted words. The line-level craft is distinguished by strong verbs and specific, surprising imagery ("crystalline grammar," "metallic sculpture of a paradox," "a wrinkle in the world"). There are no distracting artifacts or loops; the sentences are propulsive and clear, building momentum steadily toward the powerful final paragraph. This is clean, confident writing that trusts its images to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, concise, and demonstrates high information density from the excellent opening sentence onward. The rhythm modulates well, from the quiet hum of the servers to the frantic hammering of Elara's heart. There are no notable loops, scaffold, or overwriting. The only slight weakness is the slight thematic summary near the end, which feels less crafted than the surrounding sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in its descriptions of the setting. However, it is marred by several instances of explicit thematic summary that function as scaffolding (“His motivation was simple, yet endlessly complex: to map empathy onto action”). These lines are a form of telling that disrupts the immersive quality of the otherwise concrete and sensory prose.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and powerful, original figurative language ("sun bled out... in shades of bruised apricot"). There is no overwriting, scaffolding, or redundancy; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. The clarity and rhythm are flawless, especially in the climactic paragraph describing the sound of the calving ice, which builds with a powerful, controlled cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. The rhythm supports the contemplative momentum beautifully. The piece is marred only by a single line: "This quiet effort to nurture intersubjective understanding..." This phrase represents a jarring register drift into academic language, a prose artifact that clashes with the otherwise earthy and sensory texture of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. The rhythm is controlled, accelerating and decelerating in sync with the narrative tension. While excellent, a few opening metaphors ("loom of sound," "tapestry of doubt," "salt in water") are slightly familiar, which holds the piece just shy of the 9-band. Otherwise, the line-level execution is free of artifacts and demonstrates a high degree of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, specific imagery ("skeletal fingers clawing at a sky too blue"). The sentence structure is varied and the rhythm is controlled, creating a momentum that feels both gentle and purposeful. The primary weakness is a tendency toward writerly abstraction ("geography of a community's heart") and the thematic summary in the final paragraph, which slightly pads the prose and lessens the impact of the final image. This minor overwriting is the only element holding it back from true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and clarity. Figurative language, such as "a man folded into the shape of a question mark," is original and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—polished, evocative, and efficient. Every sentence carries weight, advancing atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language, such as memory "fraying like the exposed copper wire," is fresh, specific, and perfectly integrated. The piece demonstrates excellent syntactic variety and rhythmic control, creating momentum without a single wasted word or clunky phrase. There are no loops, scaffold, or artifacts to disrupt the immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-constructed and rhythmically varied, creating momentum. A minor deduction is warranted for a few phrases that lean toward being overly poetic ("bruised clouds," "diamond-dust stars") and the slight repetition of the key phrase "luminous ache," which becomes a minor prose artifact that slightly dulls its final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong, varied rhythm. The line-level craft is mostly excellent, demonstrating high information density. However, a few minor artifacts prevent a higher score, such as the slight redundancy in "decisively kind force" and a general density of figurative language that occasionally borders on being overly lyrical for a moment's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating both elegance and precision. Word choice is masterful, with high information density in every sentence and no wasted motion. The figurative language, such as "dissolved like sugar in hot tea" and the "frayed tapestry of existence," is fresh and purposeful. The story is free of loops, scaffolding, or any line-level artifacts, exhibiting a polish that is ready for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, confident, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. The central metaphor of bone-setting is woven seamlessly into the language. There are, however, minor moments of overwriting where the figurative language becomes too dense or explicit, such as "a deep, irreparable cleft in certainty opened within him, a chasm...," which restates the same idea. These moments are infrequent but slightly dull the momentum in an otherwise propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative figurative language that rarely feels overwrought. Sentences like "its surface dull as a cataract" and "a slow caress against its frosted skin" are both beautiful and functional. The piece maintains momentum through its rhythmic, incantatory quality, demonstrating exceptional control at the line level with no discernible artifacts or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative from the opening line. Sentences are crafted for rhythm and density, with strong verbs and specific, sensory language. While the style verges on the lyrical, it rarely becomes overwritten, instead maintaining a controlled, focused momentum. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every description contributes to atmosphere, character, or the thematic argument.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, characterized by information density and rhythmic control. Some of the figurative language is extremely ambitious and dense, such as "breathing the very air inside the whisper of closing pages," which borders on overwriting but ultimately serves the story's surreal atmosphere without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence serving character, atmosphere, or action. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to build momentum toward the climax. There are no significant loops or scaffolding, resulting in a polished and propulsive read that feels professional and intentional.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating both density and propulsion without a single wasted word or overwrought image. Figurative language, such as paths of light like "glowing capillaries," is both beautiful and functionally clear. The sentence structure varies to control pace, from long, flowing descriptions to the short, declarative finality of his release of the map. No prose artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly polished, with very few wasted words. Figurative language, such as the sunbeam as a "celestial clock hand," is both beautiful and functional. There is a slight tendency toward heavily conceptual phrasing ("the weight of the wounded season’s oppressive calm") that verges on being overwritten, but it largely stays within the bounds of the story's elevated tone and does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, marked by inventive, precise figurative language ("silence folded carefully atop another"). Sentence structure is varied and the rhythm supports the story's solemn atmosphere. While the density of metaphor is consistently high, it serves the voice well; a single phrase, "The whalebone reverie of Kaelen's existence deepened," borders on opacity but does not break the story's momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous, clean, and highly effective, with high information density in nearly every line. Figurative language is specific and resonant (e.g., "vanished like a breath on a cold day," "bottle a storm"). The rhythm is controlled, accelerating with the kettle's boil and settling into a deeper quiet at the end. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating a polish and precision that serves the story's emotional core without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and displays a high level of craft. Sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, and word choice is precise and evocative ("sound congealed like amber"). There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought figurative language, even in moments of high emotional intensity. The clarity and momentum are maintained from the compelling opening to the quiet, resonant final line.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive from the superb opening line onward. Word choice is precise, and figurative language ("ghost of a ghost," "temporary artery of diesel-fueled electricity") is both evocative and thematically coherent. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is of the highest caliber, demonstrating both precision and evocative power. Sentences like "The silence he now inhabited was once the canvas; it had instead become the tomb" carry immense thematic and emotional weight. Information density is high, with virtually no wasted words or scaffolding. The prose maintains its lyrical quality even while driving the narrative forward, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and confident, marked by fresh figurative language ("surfacing leviathan") and a strong, varied rhythm. Sentences are constructed with purpose, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously without wasted words. The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or other prose artifacts, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and easily meeting the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single wasted word. Figurative language, such as the rope as a "hardened fist of hemp," is evocative and precise, enhancing meaning without becoming overwrought. The piece is free of scaffolding or loops, with a varied and elegant sentence structure that propels the quiet narrative forward with unwavering grace.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.9)
    The line-level craft is of the highest caliber. The prose is both lyrical and precise, with high information density where every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and theme. Figurative language is thematically coherent and powerful, entirely free of cliché or overwriting. There are no technical flaws; the piece reads as meticulously polished and ready for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with virtually no wasted words or scaffolding. Word choice is precise and evocative ("cerulean shards," "salt-rimed railings"), and figurative language is consistently strong and integrated, as in the description of the creature's wings as "lattices of shimmering crystal threaded with living veins." The piece is technically pristine, clear of the loops or artifacts that mar lesser work.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and strong verbs. Figurative language, like "ghost ship on a glassy sea" and "bruised twilight sky," is effective and sets a literary tone. The momentum is excellent, though the final two paragraphs contain a few phrases that lean toward summary ("She was proving her own deepest conviction," "Her father had taught her..."), slightly dulling the immediacy of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong, specific verbs and nouns, with no discernible artifacts, loops, or overwriting. Figurative language, such as the fountain basins as "gaping, voiceless" mouths, is consistently fresh and purposeful. Sentence structure and rhythm vary effectively to control pacing, particularly in the hushed, deliberate final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and flawlessly executed. Every sentence carries weight, advancing either the narrative, the emotional state, or the thematic argument. Figurative language, like "sonar pinging... of empathy," is not ornamental but foundational to the story’s conceit, demonstrating exceptional integration of line-level craft and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with high information density in its figurative language. While consistently elevated, the imagery ("flickering embers," "skeletal fingers") serves the story's melancholic and reflective tone without becoming overwrought. The sentences are well-varied, the rhythm propels the narrative forward, and the piece is free of distracting loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and integrated figurative language ("a dull sun in the gloom," "a relentless sigh over shards of stone"). The rhythm is controlled and purposeful, especially in the final lines. A fractional deduction for a few instances of abstract summary (e.g., "an incremental absolution") that slightly tell rather than show, momentarily flattening the otherwise impeccable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and purposeful, with very few wasted words. Figurative language, such as the silo's skin "drink[ing] the twilight," is evocative and precise. The sentences have a varied, lyrical rhythm that propels the quiet narrative forward without a single loop or moment of scaffolding. The clarity of the prose during the complex deciphering process is particularly impressive, ensuring the climax is both intellectually and emotionally lucid.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and dense with information, but it is held back by minor, recurring artifacts. Several paragraphs begin with a similar "It was..." or "His..." construction, creating a subtle template cadence. There is also some near-redundancy in phrasing, such as the repeated emphasis on the blankness of the page, which slightly dulls the propulsion in an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, marked by high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, as in "coiled around simple tunes like ivy on a forgotten trellis." There are no wasted words or movements; every sentence contributes to the story's atmosphere and forward momentum. The craftsmanship is clean, confident, and free of any distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled, demonstrating high information density in every sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a palpable atmosphere without a single overwrought phrase or mixed metaphor. The line-level craft is clean and propulsive, with a syntax that mirrors the story's ritualistic pacing, accelerating in moments of action and settling into profound quiet at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language, such as "his abrasive calm settling over him like a shroud" and the "chalky residue of dissolved plaster," is evocative and precise without a hint of overwriting. The piece demonstrates impeccable line-level craft, showing zero evidence of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, resulting in a clean, propulsive read from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its use of sensory detail and metaphor. The rhythm is controlled and purposeful, supporting the story's quiet intensity. The only slight flaw is the final descriptive sentence, which feels a touch overwrought and explicit compared to the refined subtlety of the preceding prose, momentarily shifting from showing to telling.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with powerful, concise imagery ("a metal skeleton sighing"). However, the piece is marred by a significant register drift in the line "It was an act of guided synaptic plasticity." This academic phrasing clashes with the chef's established voice and the story's mythic tone, reading as a prose artifact. This single, jarring moment in an otherwise polished piece is a notable flaw that prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery creating a vivid world. The rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, matching the story's deliberate pace. A minor weakness is found in the final paragraphs, where a few sentences shift from showing to summarizing the outcome (e.g., “He had preserved a little wonder…”), slightly flattening the otherwise powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality, characterized by its precision, rhythm, and high information density. Figurative language is fresh and effective ("streetlights daydreamed") without becoming overwrought. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no momentum-dragging loops or scaffolding. A single minor cliché ("heart hammered") is a negligible flaw in an otherwise stellar execution of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and purposeful, with no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistently strong and integrated, such as the ampoule's contents swirling "like a captive nebula." Sentence structure and rhythm vary effectively to match the story's contemplative yet tense pacing. There are no distracting line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the craft is clean and serves the story's momentum perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without a single wasted word. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to control momentum, especially in the transition from the methodical work to the climactic rupture. Figurative language, such as "dissecting its ghost" and "prodding a sleeping god with a compass and a ruler," is fresh and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density. The rhythm modulates effectively with the story's tension. The figurative language is generally strong and purposeful ("canyon of apartment blocks," "nascent stars"). A handful of phrases lean towards the overwrought ("a glyph from his imagined lexicon of grace"), a minor indulgence that keeps the line-level craft from feeling absolutely flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery ("voice thin as spun glass," "a web of deadly potential"). The rhythm is controlled, building momentum effectively toward the climax. There are no significant loops or scaffolding issues. The only minor weakness is the final sentence, which feels slightly less crafted than the rest of the piece, functioning more as a concluding summary than a resonant final image in its own right.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with strong verbs and purposeful figurative language ("rocks like the bones of a forgotten leviathan"). The rhythm is controlled, building momentum without a single wasted word or repetitive sentence structure. There are no distracting line-level artifacts, resulting in a clean, propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely free of artifacts. The figurative language, such as "a sweetness that coated the back of my throat like a lie," is both original and effective at establishing mood and character. While the language is consistently elevated, it remains within the established voice and rarely feels overwrought. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, carrying the reader through to the powerful conclusion without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is very strong, with elegant phrasing ("The blue hour bled across the sea") and high information density. The prose is clean and propulsive. A minor weakness is a tendency towards high figurative density that, while generally effective, occasionally feels slightly overwrought, as in "a sudden chorus of frantic whispers" or "a panicked cacophony." However, there are no significant loops, artifacts, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density from the opening sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative ("spidery script," "sonic syntax," "sunwashed dread") without becoming overwrought. The sentence and paragraph structure vary to control momentum, creating a sense of both vast, slow time and immediate, personal urgency. The piece is free of scaffolding or loops, resulting in a clean and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates strong command of language and imagery. However, two minor issues prevent a top score. First, the paragraph detailing the Ashworth Collapse uses a series of sentences with a similar structure ("Official records had to be...", "People felt...", "Trust... eroded"), creating a slightly list-like cadence. More critically, the summary statements in the final third act as scaffolding, paraphrasing the effect of the dialogue rather than letting the action carry the full weight of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and dense with purpose. Word choice is precise and imagery is strong, particularly in the descriptions of the setting and the inkwell. There are a few instances where a phrase leans toward the ornate ("the currents of feeling that ran just as deep and inexorable within him") or a slightly stock image ("hushed blaze in his eyes"), which are the only elements holding it back from perfection. Overall, the line-level craft demonstrates immense control and artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and exceptionally clean, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Phrasing like "The low, omnipresent hum...died without a whimper" and "the shriek of wood a sacrilege in the new silence" is both beautiful and functional. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or plot momentum. The clarity and precision of the language, especially during the climactic discovery, are flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is overwhelmingly strong, concise, and evocative, with a clear, propulsive rhythm. However, a few phrases, such as "powdered starlight" and "a thousand fractured rainbows," lean into a slightly overwrought lyricism that momentarily detracts from the otherwise grounded emotional reality. While beautiful, this density of figurative language in key descriptive passages is a hairline flaw that keeps the prose just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is largely stellar, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and evocative, precise imagery. However, a significant line-level artifact—the sentence fragment "[ intricately tangible a force as gravity."—breaks the flow and clarity at a key descriptive moment. While the surrounding craft is superb, this unforced error prevents a near-perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum effectively. Word choice is generally strong and evocative ("golden filigree," "resonant chime"). Minor instances of scaffolding, such as "Her motivation was simple," tell the reader information that could be shown, slightly flattening the prose's texture and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong, memorable images ("world bleeding from blue to bruised purple," "sandpaper on bone"). The momentum is excellent. A minor repetition of the exact phrase "tempered regret" slightly dulls the impact of the final line, where a fresher phrasing could have landed with more force. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional: precise, evocative, and dense with meaning without a single wasted word. The opening sentence is a model of sensory detail and atmospheric setup. The syntax varies to create a somber, deliberate rhythm that matches the story's tone. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or plot, demonstrating a very high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from an over-density of figurative language. While many metaphors are strong on their own ("cartography of his failure," "keel broken on the shores of what should have been"), their sheer frequency verges on overwriting, particularly in the first half. This relentless poeticism can slightly dull the momentum and specificity of the moment. The craft is clearly evident, but a more judicious use of metaphor would have given the strongest images even greater power.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely clean, concise, and often evocative, with strong imagery like "a jagged mouth breathing cool, damp air." Momentum is well-maintained. A significant flaw occurs in the final line, "He had found his kindle." This pun is tonally inconsistent with the rest of the piece and cheapens the gravity of the preceding realization, ending a strong story on a weak note.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise, and the sentence structure varies to control rhythm effectively, especially during the climax. Figurative language, such as grief as a "vast, silent ocean contained within a calm shell," is both beautiful and functional. The piece is remarkably clean, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or overwriting that would dull the impact of its powerful final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with a high density of evocative imagery ("onyx-ink," "star-woven cloak"). The rhythm is controlled, modulating effectively between moments of sharp anxiety and quiet reflection. The score is held back only by a couple of minor blemishes: the use of the common cliché "slipping through her fingers like fine sand" and the slightly overwrought "map of her own fractured heart," which stand out in an otherwise fresh and carefully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and maintains a high information density without feeling overwritten. Word choices are precise and evocative ("a needle thin as a whisper and a thread of spun starlight"). The rhythm and syntax support the solemn, ritualistic pacing of the narrative, accelerating and calming in sync with the character's emotional journey. The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or other line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. Sentences are rhythmically varied and carry the story's momentum effectively. The piece suffers from a mild density of figurative language, where some descriptions feel slightly overwrought ("star-dusted night," "swirling galaxy of gentle, greenish-gold light"). While beautiful, this consistent elevation can occasionally dull the impact of the most critical moments, a hairline crack in an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative imagery and a good sense of rhythm. However, there are moments where it leans on telling over showing, particularly in the second paragraph which summarizes Kael’s character and motivation. Some descriptive passages are dense with adjectives ("soft, pearlescent light against the ink-black backdrop"), which slightly slows the momentum in what should be a taut scene.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly effective, with powerful, specific imagery ("a thimbleful of night that warped the air," "a silent, glassy sheet of annihilation"). While the figurative language is consistently elevated, bordering on overwriting, it successfully establishes the story's epic tone without sacrificing clarity or momentum. There are no loops or wasted words; every sentence carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, with a strong opening and many memorable phrases. The figurative language is dense and ambitious, which mostly works to establish the poetic voice. However, a few moments verge on being slightly overwritten (e.g., "screaming hurricane, his body a statue of calm"), creating a minor drag on momentum that keeps the line-level craft just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, there are moments where the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought, approaching a level of ornamentation that slightly thickens the prose. Phrasings like "a whirlwind of dignified chaos contained within the atrium’s serene walls" are evocative but flirt with being self-consciously literary, a minor drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, marked by strong verbs and vivid, original imagery. The rhythm of the sentences effectively mirrors the quiet, meticulous action of the characters. While the overall craft is at a very high level, the climactic line of poetry feels slightly less sharp than the surrounding prose, bordering on aphorism. It's a minor point in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional information density and rhythmic control, balancing lush, evocative imagery with concise, propulsive action. There are no wasted sentences or scaffolding; each line contributes to atmosphere, character, or plot momentum. The final paragraph, in particular, achieves a powerful crescendo and release with clean, precise language that makes the magical event feel solid and real.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is consistently beautiful, with vivid imagery and a strong, controlled rhythm. Sentences are dense with meaning without feeling overwritten, and the language choices are precise. While the density of figurative language is high, it is a successful stylistic choice that reinforces the world's "whimsical" nature without obscuring clarity, even at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and rhythmic precision.

    Zero loops, high density ("a miniature aurora in the cramped dark"). "Clenching fear" borders on label but saved by "constant companion" concreteness. Final line's rhythm elevates closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; high density ("a tear traced a path through the dust on Kael's cheek"). Final line ("fleeting illusion of peace to hold against the night") crystallizes theme without overwriting. Slight purple risk in "grief so vast" offset by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density ("peeling back strata of collapse") with rhythmic propulsion, but scaffold weakens momentum: "his philosophy one of stark, material truth" tells rather than shows. Final line ("calmly, stubbornly, remember") achieves crystalline closure without artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid with high density ("cacophony of sensation was a poison"), though "physical manifestation of society’s traumatic decline" risks abstraction; no loops in closure beat preserves propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; high density ("syrupy, nectar dusk painted anxious faces"). Final line's rhythmic resolution ("preserved a little wonder, and for now, that was enough") charges closure. One borderline artifact: "bio-mechanical life" slightly technical but offset by poetic riddle. No closure-dulling muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops; high density ("crunch of her sneakers an obscene violation" shows pressure). "Slow smile touched Elara’s lips" borders cliché, and "garish pink flamingo" feels overwrought. No artifacts in closure beat ("different kind of life was stirring" clean), but minor figurative muddle in peak beats blocks 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold in closure beats, but minor paraphrase loop in paragraph one ("clouding every belief... thought echoed") and "welcome complexity" risks abstraction; propulsion remains taut despite one near-duplicate stem ("thought echoed... a presence more than a sound").

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("whisper-faint echo of his own breathing" compresses atmosphere and stakes) with precise propulsion; figurative language ("monument to perpetual motion") avoids muddle even in high-pressure beats like the rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero scaffold or loops; "transcribing a feeling" compresses theme into action. Figurative language ("luminescence of their own") intensifies without muddying the climax. Final line crystallizes closure with "nascent stars" resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold or loops; "slick black rocks like forgotten leviathan bones" shows textural specificity. Minor abstraction in "cold fire" redeemed by embodied progression toward "dizzying lightness" in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "phantom tinkle of a dropped prize" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Density flawless until "repulsive allure" repetition in climax. No figurative muddle—metaphors serve pressure ("frantic bird in a cage of bone").

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor overwriting in calm moments ("restless euphony of survival") slightly dulls momentum, but storm sequence achieves high density ("wave crashed... struck... struck again") with zero loops and precise verbs driving propulsion toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion overall, but paraphrase loop in "dread was a physical thing now, a sun-baked certainty" dilutes momentum; no figurative muddle, yet minor redundancy prevents higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops/scaffold; "crimson petal... silent syllable" risks overwriting but earns payoff in closure. "Hungry thing" metaphor maintains coherence. Slight register drift ("meticulous curator") in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; "silt-stirred blackness" and "hushed blaze" do triple duty. Final line’s "rising tide" recharges opening marsh mist with closure weight. No figurative muddle—every image serves pressure, especially inkwell as "dark star" crystallizing purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "saline-treated paper and pressed kelp-vellum" exemplifies high-density worldbuilding. Final line ("silent partner in his meticulous, solitary reclamation") crystallizes theme through concrete action without abstraction. Minor deduction for one near-duplicate ("faint, flickering biolamps"/"ghostly, passive luminescence").

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level propulsion shines ("dust like powdered starlight"), but "luminous torment" appears twice with minimal variation, risking slight scaffold. Final line achieves perfect resonance without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero major loops, but "needle in her soul" slightly clichéd and "intricately tangible" scaffold momentarily dulls momentum. Final line’s "terrible, beautiful coordinates" achieves high density without muddle, though peak-beat near-clichés prevent 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("sound swallowed by cavernous silence") propels momentum. Figurative language ("captured star," "weaving dance") clarifies rather than obscures, with closure image crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; high density (“sieved hush” evolves meaning across beats). Minor register drift (“psychic signature”) in high-pressure moment prevents 9.0, but final line (“would not be lost to the tide”) recharges motifs with perfect propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances tension ("a furrowed hush settled"). Figurative language sparse but potent ("chasm far wider than the parapet"). Final line crystallizes closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised twilight sky" avoids cliché through specificity. Final image ("discarded crutch" shadow) crystallizes without overwriting. Propulsion via concrete verbs: "hummed," "lapped," "raised."

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    No loops or scaffold; "worn leather/faded stitching" does triple duty (character, setting, theme). Minor density dip in "jaded wonder" label, but compensated by later embodied prose ("breath catching," "spark pierced numbness"). Closure image razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold, yet "grief a vast, silent ocean contained within a calm shell" drifts into stock metaphor during high-pressure grief, slightly muddling the otherwise crystalline propulsion of the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; "phosphorescent moss that pulsed" does triple duty (sensory/atmosphere/symbol). Final line crystallizes theme without overwriting. One borderline tell: "testament to clumsiness" risks abstraction but is anchored by prior ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose achieves high density with rhythmic control ("stitched and floated, stitched and sank"), but "crystallized compassion" edges toward convenient abstraction; zero loops, though "faint shimmer of long-dried tears" risks thematic echo if overinterpreted.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion ("hiss of waves... low thrum of molten heart" advancing atmosphere), but "sonorous sigh shuddered" creates mild metaphor dissonance; zero loops though minor register drift in "resonant frequency" during high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "tremor in his own veins" shows not tells. Final line ("lights wink back... silent promise") crystallizes closure with unmatched density. Figurative language never obscures cause/effect in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but adjacent sentences "The mathematical sequences... were a circuit. The star dust was the power source" create paraphrase loop; otherwise exceptional propulsion and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "mechanical heartbeat measuring silence between thunder's rumble" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Slight density risk in "acid of his memories" metaphor but redeemed by contextual precision in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels story. "Constellation of tiny reflections" does triple duty (atmosphere, clue, tension). Final line’s "real destination had been revealed" recharges the opening’s "waiting," avoiding closure muddle. Figurative language sparse but precise in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "sliver of bone" moon metaphor extends organically to "luminous fracture" of the poem. Final line’s "impossible, beautiful work" distills tension without cliché. Minor deduction: "cathedral of decay" edges toward familiar phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "rectangle of pure, silent-film white" delivers high density without muddle. Final line recharges "unplanned encore" motif, while "ozone and old celluloid" smell avoids cliché. Minor abstraction in "steely longing" redeemed by embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "backward river/moonlight net/laughter" sequence demonstrates high density without muddle. Final image ("seed planted, story continue") avoids overwriting through earned simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("diffuse" repeated 3x near closure) dull momentum, but prose remains lyrical and propulsive. Final line ("silence that grew between them") charges closure without figurative muddle.
