  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues: "accumulated dust patterns" appears three times, "storm-damaged greenhouse" twice, "kindled humility" twice. Template cadence runs through middle paragraphs ("Elena had...", "Elena realized...", "Elena smiled..."). The final paragraph's explicit theme summary severely dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant prose issues include repetitive phrasing ("quiet canyon under stars" appears verbatim three times), abstract telling ("profound silence," "drifting resonance"), and template constructions ("Lena had always been...," "Lena had always believed..."). The revelation paragraph relies on exposition rather than scene work. Information density is low with multiple sentences restating similar concepts about transformation and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe repetition issues: "unshaken marvels" (4x), "translate silence into music" (3x), "heat-mapping emotions" (2x) create loops rather than progression. Template cadence dominates ("Elena [verb]," "She [verb]" patterns). The prose lacks density - many sentences restate information without advancing ("The capsize survivor had not only survived disaster but had created something new").

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("Fish scattered like silver thoughts") with good rhythm variation. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("weary undertaker" repeated, "giving rest a permanent address" echoed verbatim). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is generally strong, with most lines advancing character, conflict, or atmosphere. However, several passages contain mild redundancy ("exile community"/"fled their homeland," repeated emphasis on sanctions) and occasional register elevation that doesn't match the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("wisteria blooms cascaded down the pillars like purple waterfalls"), but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elara understood," "Elara knew") and occasional abstraction. The epilogue section particularly loses momentum with its shift to summary mode.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from template cadence ("She [verb]," "Elara [verb]" patterns) and abstract descriptors that dull immediacy. Paraphrase loops appear notably in the retrocognitive sequences where similar content restates across adjacent lines. The phrase "quaking reverie" repeats three times without evolving meaning, and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she could see," "she witnessed") distance key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and appropriate rhythm shifts. However, several template phrases appear: "In the center of the room stood," "In the weeks that followed," creating mechanical transitions. The final paragraph relies on summary rather than scene ("traveled from village to village, teaching people"), losing the immediacy of earlier passages. Some redundancy exists between "chained liberator" being stated multiple times without evolving meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=5.8)
    While individual sentences are well-crafted, there's significant repetition and scaffolding throughout. "The sound of trust breaking" appears five times with minimal variation. Paragraphs 12-14 essentially restate the same discovery about trust breaking/reforming. The phrase "battered marvel" feels forced into paragraphs 10 and 22. These loops and the overreliance on abstract description over concrete action diminish momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the world seemed dipped in melted gold") with varied sentence structure and strong rhythm. However, abstract phrases like "luminous disbelief" appear three times without earning their repetition, and some passages lean purple ("press her ear against destiny's door") without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe template cadence with "Elias [verb]" or "The contemplative glassblower" opening 11+ paragraphs creates mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loops appear throughout ("abandoning/abandoned" used 12 times, "thawing heart" repeated without evolution). The prose achieves moments of clarity but these patterned artifacts pervade, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Maya had always been...", "Maya adjusted...", "Maya pressed...") and overreliance on abstract declarations. Phrases like "unstoppable power of absolute truth" and "transformative betrayal" lean heavily on telling over showing. The story also loops the vulnerability-as-power concept multiple times without adding pressure. Some mixed metaphors appear (seashell "whispering" but also growing "warmer").

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("one smooth as glass, one jagged as broken bone") and rhythmic control in the opening. However, abstract phrasing accumulates in the middle section ("extending consciousness," "interconnected darknesses") and some paraphrase loops appear ("summarizing silence"/"reading spaces between words"). The filter verb "knowing" in the penultimate paragraph dulls what should be peak immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive "Unit 347" sentence openings (12 instances) creating template cadence. Abstract phrases like "mystical significance in the mundane" and "consciousness itself through the medium of service" lean toward thesis language rather than embodied imagery. Information density is moderate but several paragraphs restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose flows clearly without major artifacts but suffers from abstraction and telling. Phrases like "self-imposed prisons of silence" and "facilitator of honest communication" summarize rather than dramatize. Some repetitive structures emerge ("She realized," "She understood," "She decided") but don't obstruct comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues damage momentum: "commemorating another small victory elaborately" appears verbatim twice, "gardens know their gardeners" repeats three times. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("Elias believed... Elias smiled... Elias whispered... Elias made his way"). The final paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops restating the same concepts about measurement versus mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "mechanically warm" appears four times, "magnetic nexus at twilight" five times, "subdued awakenings" three times. Multiple paraphrase loops occur ("The obliging sky mechanic had succeeded"/"The obliging soul"). Template cadence pervades lever sequences and numerous filter constructions ("Aris watched," "she felt," "she knew") dull immediacy in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows clearly but contains repetitive phrasing around "water-stained/water-damaged" and abstract constructions like "something he couldn't name but felt in his bones." Information density is moderate—most sentences advance the story but some scaffold remains ("Elias realized he would need to"). No major clarity issues impede comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without clear payoff ("subcutaneous map drawn not in ink but in sorrow"). Several passages loop conceptually, particularly around the auroral sorrow metaphor, and the final paragraph relies heavily on abstract exposition rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("swallowed truth" appears 6 times with minimal variation) and abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy. The closure beat contains template cadence: "Marcus felt lighter...the weight of his own swallowed truths finally acknowledged." Information density is low with multiple sentences restating similar concepts about hidden truths.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("profound quiet," "active, presence-filled void") and some redundancy ("silent observer," "steadily, silently"). The phrase "cryptic folds" appears twice. Information density is moderate; some sentences could do more work.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose clarity is generally strong but several passages suffer from overwriting ("eerie twilight," "fragile but real, like a newly opened flower"). Template phrases appear ("tears blurring her vision," "held its breath in anticipation"). The metaphor density in emotional beats reduces momentum, and some sentences could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues: "bronze quiet" appears 7 times, "the odd historian" 6 times, "sensitively perceptive" 3 times, creating loops rather than accumulation. Template cadence runs throughout ("The historian..." starting multiple paragraphs). These artifacts dull momentum and prevent the prose from achieving the density needed at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive repetition weakens momentum: "open secrets" appears 6 times with minimal variation, "hidden in plain sight" recurs without development, and conceptual loops abound ("deeper meanings," "deeper truths," "deeper understanding"). Template cadence dominates with "He [verb]" and "The writer [verb]" patterns. While grammatically clean, the prose lacks density—many sentences restate rather than advance ("visible to all yet understood by few who bothered to look closer and question what they thought they knew").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose clarity generally strong but suffers from abstract tendency: "decorated with silence," "unraveled stillness," "muffled clarity" pile up without concrete grounding. Some effective moments ("fingers trembling as they hovered") but overreliance on conceptual language over sensory immediacy. Template phrases like "smiled faintly" and "gasped, her eyes clearing" reduce impact.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "chronologically homesick" appears three times with similar phrasing, "unheard symphonies" repeats without variation, and the memory catalogues ("sound of mother humming," "first taste of honey") follow predictable list structures. The prose also suffers from abstract phrasing ("something deep within his soul," "vibrations building") that dilutes specificity, though the mirrored horizon image and some sensory details provide counterweight.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant paraphrase loops appear throughout: "fractured timelines" concept explained multiple times, the tablet's purpose restated. Template phrases like "he understood now" and "began to" create scaffold. The prose relies on abstract descriptors ("paradoxical sensation," "beautifully complex") over concrete imagery, particularly in crucial beats where specificity would heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues: "filament of hush" appears 6 times, "backward recorded songs" 4 times, "defeat emotional numbness" 3 times, creating template cadence. Abstract phrases like "tangible absence that vibrated" and "frequencies only she could feel" lack concrete grounding. The prose relies on telling emotional states ("bringing tears to her eyes") rather than embodying them through specific action.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues including "quiet courtyard" (4x), "carrier pigeon's message tube" (7x), "nurture integrity in solitude" (3x), and "layered tranquility" (3x) create scaffold that dulls momentum. Template phrases like "credibly curious" and "progressing laterally" read as prompt artifacts rather than organic prose, while several paragraphs could be cut without loss of information.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=5.9)
    Significant overwriting issues throughout: purple prose ("wistful lantern broker with weathered hands and sorrow-filled eyes"), repetitive phrasing about memory and loss, and template emotional beats. The story suffers from paraphrase loops (multiple restatements of the grief/memory connection) and register drift into overly poetic diction. Information density is low with excessive reflection padding the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=4.6)
    Repetitive constructions plague the prose: "The poet" opens numerous sentences, "seemed to" appears five times, and template cadence dominates ("The pattern, born of..." "The rope, with its..."). Paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly the redundant exploration of time's changed texture.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves clarity but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"chronic hush" appears four times, creating a loop effect. Several sentences follow template patterns ("Kael would," "His family would"). The metaphorical density in peak moments ("unbind the silence itself," "tapestry of sound") borders on overwriting without sufficient grounding in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive sentence openings ("Elias adjusted," "Elias picked up," "Elias moved," "Elias reflected") create template cadence throughout. Abstract emotional language ("peaceful contentment," "genuine fulfillment," "emotional landscape") replaces concrete embodiment. The prose tells about feelings rather than rendering them through specific action or image. Filter constructions ("could sense," "watched," "reflected on") distance the reader from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and action. Information density is generally high, though some passages repeat concepts ("silent contributors" appears multiple times). The philosophical ending abstracts unnecessarily ("greatest cargo transported wasn't in containers but in the recognition of shared humanity").

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose creates atmospheric density but suffers from abstract descriptors ("luminescent ache" appears twice) and occasional overwriting ("spectral pulses," "tangled sigil"). The Chinese characters are a critical error, and some sentences strain under modifier weight, though key moments like the final dedication achieve clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure. Information density is adequate though some passages feel padded ("The air itself seemed to hum with potential melodies, songs never sung, words never spoken"). Minor redundancy in describing the time manipulation effects. The final paragraph contains some scaffolding that could be cut for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.3)
    Several template-cadence runs appear ("Elara believed...," "She traced...," "The stone...") and paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly the repeated explanations of Elara's goal to understand emotion's mathematics. The prose achieves moments of vivid specificity (glass eyes "one blue as deep water, one brown as rich earth") but loses propulsion through repetitive structural patterns and abstract philosophical framing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose has moments of specificity but suffers from repetitive phrasing around the protagonist's motivation ("to become visible to those who needed you") appearing nearly verbatim three times. Template cadence in middle sections with "They [verb]" constructions. The closing paragraph contains abstract summary rather than concrete image, dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose clarity generally serves the story, but several template phrases appear ("blur of data collection," "profound transformation"). The text contains a typo ("询问") and some repetitive structures that create mild drag, particularly in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("streams of water that carved temporary paths") but suffers from abstract explanatory passages that slow momentum. Several sentences restate concepts without advancement: "These patterns had become her obsession, her method of navigating both the physical terrain and the labyrinthine corridors of her own trauma" could be compressed. The final third shifts to summary mode, losing scene-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. "Began to" appears 7 times, creating template cadence. Phrases like "the essence of bright darkness made manifest" and "infinite possibilities blooming like crystalline flowers" lean purple. The text loops conceptually around shadow/light/crystal combinations without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "fragments into meaning" appears four times with minimal variation. Template cadence runs ("Elina stood...Elina experienced...Elina learned...Elina witnessed...Elina continued") create mechanical rhythm. Abstract diction ("systematically removed," "larger tapestry," "shared understanding") replaces concrete imagery in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation, though several template patterns recur ("He realized," "He knew," "Ethan knew"). The paraphrase loop around "analytically artistic" and repeated "trembling certainty" create minor redundancy. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance the story, but some passages could tighten, particularly the explanatory segments about what the punch represents.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstraction ("unfamiliar comfort," "quiet magic," "vast and interconnected") and repetitive phrasing ("through forgotten patterns" appears three times) drain momentum. The prose relies on telling about mystical experiences rather than rendering them concretely, with template constructions like "Elara realized," "Elara understood," "Elara began" creating distance from immediate experience.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose clarity suffers from abstract phrasing ("spatial mutiny," "hushed thunder of revelation") and repetitive constructions ("Alistair understood now," "Alistair began," "As Alistair began"). Several metaphors strain clarity ("taffy in his immortal mind," "quiet but powerful force"). Information density is moderate—many sentences advance plot but through summary rather than scene, particularly in the middle sections describing dimensional observations.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is generally clean but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting - "deathly vitality" appears twice, multiple sentences begin with "Maya had," and phrases like "impossible patterns that seemed to shift her perspective" feel redundant. The text lacks the propulsive quality needed for a heist sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of telling rather than showing ("His motivation was singular and pure") and some repetitive phrasing around "temporal texture" and "preservation." The opening and closing sentences effectively frame the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops: "erasing me from databases and official histories" restates the same erasure; "I wander without name, a ghost with flesh" repeats the liminal state already established. Template cadence appears in "Each morning... By day... The tides..." creating predictable rhythm. The piece lacks information density, with many sentences restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose generally maintains clarity and momentum, though several template patterns emerge: "As Evelyn..." appears multiple times, and the final third contains repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Major weakness is the conceptual redundancy in the closing paragraphs where the theme gets restated in variations rather than deepening through new particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose remains functional but suffers from summary-heavy passages ("For three nights, Maya barely slept...") that compress pivotal development. Multiple template constructions appear ("Maya became...", "Maya watched...", "Maya removed..."). The text relies on abstract emotional labels ("desperation mounted," "hope persisted") rather than embodied detail, particularly in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "moonlit summit" appears 5 times, "dawnlit melancholy" 3 times, "dawning hush" 4 times, "nightwatch's hourglass sand grain" 5 times, "purposefully curious" 2 times. These paraphrase loops and template phrases ("She was determined to," "Elena needed to," "She had done") create mechanical cadence. The story also suffers from telling rather than showing pivotal moments—we're told about Elena's emotions rather than experiencing them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong sensory detail and varied sentence structure. Several instances of overwriting ("ethereal silence," "vulnerable nerves," "ballet in miniature") and some redundancy in describing the mist's presence. The water-refraction passage achieves good clarity but occasional purple prose touches ("iridescent wings bent at unnatural angles") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though several instances of elevated diction ("herald of discovery," "sacred place felt different") create mild register drift from Elmsley's established pragmatic voice. Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for the template-like "For three days" progression and occasional abstraction ("poetry of creation intertwined") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths matching the methodical pace of restoration. Information density is high—most sentences advance both action and atmosphere. Minor repetition in restoration descriptions ("began to," "slowly") and occasional elevated diction ("infinitely patient" used twice) prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures. However, multiple instances of overwriting appear: "magnificent temple" (used twice), "otherworldly blue luminescence," "descending angels." Template cadence in "Elena knew...Elena smiled...Elena capped" creates repetitive stems. These artifacts prevent higher scoring despite solid baseline craft.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues pervade the text: "lattice from confessional" appears 7 times, "before they find the bodies" 4 times, creating mechanical loops rather than purposeful pattern. Template cadence dominates ("In the lighthouse prison...", "Through the scuffs..."). While some repetition serves the accumulative structure, the lack of variation dulls momentum and creates paraphrase loops that restate without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density with phrases like "lovingly venomous pollen that made the air thick with dreams" and varied sentence structures. However, multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum (lines 25-27 repeat the mutual tragedy; lines 28-29 restate testimony). Some overwrought figurative language ("skeleton weeds," "morning fog") and filter-verb clusters in peak beats reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive repetition weakens momentum: "sleepwalking" appears 7 times, multiple sentences begin with "The" or "She," and abstract phrases like "transforming ruin into reverence" loop without variation. Template constructions ("The [noun] [verb]...") dominate, creating mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("roots snaking between bones in a grotesque yet beautiful dance") with varied rhythm. However, template cadence appears in sequences like "He nodded...He found himself...He began bringing" and conceptual redundancy weakens momentum ("homecoming in the truest sense, both geographical and spiritual, completing a circle"). Some filter verbs ("Kaelen noticed," "he felt") dull immediacy without voice justification.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("golden receptacle at the arcade's end") but suffers from conceptual redundancy and abstract phrasing. Sentences like "Each pseudonym was a celebration of identity's fluidity" and the following sentence essentially restate the same idea. Some passages feel more like meditation than scene, though this fits the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful paragraph structure, particularly in the escalating middle section. However, several phrases repeat conceptually ("whispered secrets"/"whispers"/"whispered"), and abstract descriptors like "echoed silence" and "adjacent possibilities" recur without gaining specificity. The line "The universe has secrets if you listen with your hands" lands memorably, but filter constructions ("Elara knew," "revealed itself") occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing—"fierce tenderness" appears four times, "singing spirits" seven times, "moment before deciding" five times. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("She listened...," "She closed...," "She emerged..."). While individual sentences achieve lyrical moments, the accumulation of mystical descriptors ("otherworldly," "haunting melodies," "ancient stone") creates purple-prose density that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues: "shrewdly innocent" (2x), "unknot/unknotting" (4x), "brain coral fragment" (6x), "smudged" (5x) create loops that dull momentum. Sentences often paraphrase rather than advance ("The translator knew too well such rituals" follows directly after showing the ritual). Information density is compromised by redundant abstractions.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose achieves moments of vivid imagery ("paintbrushes like liquid dawn") and maintains forward momentum. However, several paraphrase loops weaken density: "rediscover the lost joy"/"rediscover lost joy"/"rediscovered lost joy" and the repetitive "fog/mist" constructions. The phrase "pensive mirth" appears twice, creating unnecessary echo, and some sentences rely on telling rather than embodied action ("Amelia knew better").

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=5.3)
    Significant repetition issues weaken momentum: "methodically playful" appears four times, "pause between question and reply" three times, "reflected sound" variations cluster densely. Template cadence runs through the awakening sequences ("The third awakening came... The fourth awakening..."). These patterns, combined with abstract phrasing in peak moments, create scaffold that dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("converging chaos" appears twice) and abstract declarations that lack concrete grounding. Several sentences restate concepts without advancing pressure, particularly in exposition-heavy middle sections about the resistance network.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose achieves moments of musical control ("half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind") but suffers from paraphrase loops ("centuries of longing" appears twice identically) and abstract cushioning. Information density drops in middle sections with repetitive descriptions of blossoms spreading, and several template constructions ("Sometimes...the poet wondered," "Now the gargantuan shell pulsed") reveal scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("tears that felt like tiny glass orchids unfurling in their heart") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Multiple sentences begin with "Eleth" creating template cadence, and phrases like "sacred spaces protected" and "protective silence" create minor redundancy. The density of figurative language in non-peak moments ("tendrils caressing," "symphony echoing") occasionally slows momentum without pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "interconnected promises" appears 7 times, "symphonies of truth" 5 times, "carefully reckless" 4 times, "glass ink well" 5 times, creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content ("restore trust after silence" variations). The prose tells rather than shows pivotal discoveries, summarizing breakthroughs instead of dramatizing them.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum—"antique surveyor's chain" appears 7 times, "breathing/breathed" 6 times, creating loops. Template cadence emerges in middle sections ("She had...", "She traced...", "She imagined..."). The prose achieves clarity but lacks density; many sentences do single jobs rather than layering meaning. "Encrypted compassion" and "dappled resolve" feel forced as recurring phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("dust motes danced...swirling in patterns that seemed to shift according to her heartbeat") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. Multiple sentences begin with "She" or "Her," creating template cadence. Figurative density is high without clear payoff ("bloomed in her senses even as it withered away the memories"). The paraphrase loop about patterns appearing twice dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("tears catching the light like prisms") but occasionally loops concepts ("necessary distances" appears four times). Some sentences strain under abstract weight, yet rhythm generally supports the accumulative structure through varied paragraph lengths and purposeful repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "rhythm of belonging her soul craved" restated as "eternal dance of connection"; "changed forever" followed by redundant elaboration about transformation. Template cadence appears in emotional beats ("Maya felt...," "Maya knew...," "Maya watched..."), and abstract labels replace concrete imagery at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "cheerful gloom" appears 5 times, "before memory fades" 4 times, creating loops rather than purposeful pattern. Template cadence pervades: "The recollectionist [verb]" structure dominates. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same insights about transformation without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.3)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "orchestrated serendipity" concept explained three different ways, Leo's mission restated redundantly. Phrases like "lightly attentive to her micro-expressions of surprise delight" feel artificially compressed. The prose achieves moments of elegance ("stars peeked through the glass ceiling") but suffers from repetitive explanatory passages.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstract language ("cosmic verse," "profound vision," "ancient magic") creates distance rather than immediacy. Template mystical phrases accumulate without specific imagery. Repetitive structure in the middle sections with multiple "she [verb]" constructions. The transformation sequence relies on telling rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting throughout with abstract labels ("noctilucent reckonings"), redundant loops ("seeing—truly seeing"), and template phrasing ("With this sacred resolve burning within her"). The prose tells emotional states rather than dramatizing them. Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong imagery. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("survivor, like him, bearing witness" repeats the survival theme; "scarred and whole" restates earlier paradoxes). Template cadence in "He needed...He remembered...He held" sequence. Information density could be higher in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=4.9)
    Significant overwriting issues: mixed metaphors ("trial balloons" as both conceptual equations and physical decorations), repetitive phrasing ("logical dreamer" appears 4 times), and abstract inflation ("fabric of possibility"). Template cadence runs appear ("Elian carefully... Elian threaded... Elian closed"). The prose prioritizes atmospheric suggestion over clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("passages didn't just resonate with sound; they held the imprints" restates the prior sentence's content). Template cadence appears in discovery sequences ("Elara realized... Elara began to understand... Elara committed"). However, clarity remains strong and the closure image lands without obstruction. Information density is moderate with some sentences doing single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from abstract telling in crucial moments ("spirit soared with the grace of understanding"). Several template constructions appear ("The elusive mirage painter" opens three paragraphs), and figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies the magical mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe overwriting pervades the text with abstract descriptors ("unquenchable idealism," "collective memory of betrayal," "ethereal glow") that lack specificity. Template cadence appears in repetitive "Elian [verb]" constructions. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same content ("Peace...was not an event but a practice" follows similar earlier statements). The prose prioritizes elevated diction over clarity and momentum, creating distance rather than immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions linking external and internal landscapes. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "everything he had destroyed and everything he secretly longed to preserve" followed by similar restatements. Template cadence appears in "Silas had always been... Silas smiled... Silas Thorne understood." Some overwriting in metaphorical density during peak moments ("fractured grace," "divided soul," "crystalline wasteland").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition problems undermine momentum: "prism sanctuary under starlight" appears 7 times, "between sigh and smile" 5 times, "chaste courtesan" 5 times, creating mechanical loops rather than purposeful pattern. Abstract phrasing like "liberation of consciousness itself" and "transcendence" replaces concrete imagery in crucial beats. Template constructions ("She had preserved not merely her body but her essence") and paraphrase loops dilute impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "uncommonly serene" appears four times, "half-lit epiphany" four times, "campfire story stick" seven times, creating template cadence. Key phrases like "meteor hush" and "subversive puppet shows in seedy bars" mechanically recur without variation. The prose achieves clarity but lacks the density and propulsion needed when every sentence should advance story in this length.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though several instances of abstraction weaken immediacy: "esoteric realist" appears without concrete grounding, "cosmic forces beyond their comprehension" remains vague. Some repetitive phrasing around "remembered/remembrance/remembering" and overuse of "interrupted cadence." The writing is competent but lacks the precision needed for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm, particularly strong in the rope sequence. Some overwriting appears - "ethereal blues and greens," "ceremonial rope, centuries old" could be tighter. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs, though "transcribed in light, preserved at last" contains mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of genuine beauty ("memories left too long in the sun") but suffers from abstract philosophical passages and some overwriting ("the strange twilight of foresight and hindsight only"). Several sentences could be compressed for greater impact, and figurative language occasionally overwhelms the concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("twilight painted his study in shades of amethyst and indigo") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "frugal" and "encrypted devotion." The phrase "empirically ironic" appears three times without variation. Some sentences restate rather than advance ("For years, he had documented..." followed by similar content). The unexplained "dato" and untranslated Chinese characters "无数次" break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract elevation and repetitive phrasing around "cellular memory," "shifting reality," and variants of "broken/intact." The overuse of metaphorical language ("starlight given solid form," "metallic despair") creates density without precision, though no major loops or scaffolding appear.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the transformation sequence. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("glass mountains caught in the sun's first rays," "luminous butterfly of starlight and mathematics") and the final paragraph contains mild redundancy about the workshop's future purpose. Information density is moderate, with some descriptive passages that don't advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation, particularly in the bridge-building sequence. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, some template cadence appears ("She pulled out...Then her fingers brushed...") and redundant phrasing weakens momentum ("endearingly feisty" appears three times). The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece with the deciduous vows metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "Elias" appears 16 times, "bewildered curator" twice verbatim, "brightened disquiet" forced in twice, "philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms" repeated awkwardly. Template cadence dominates ("Elias [verb]" structure). The prose tells about wonder rather than creating it through specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("swirling mass of ink-crafted entities") but suffers from abstraction in crucial beats - "delicate process of extraction" summarizes rather than dramatizes the rescue. Template phrasing appears ("racing heart," "tender reverence") and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("library of unlearned lessons" repeated without variation, "carefully resourceful" echoed verbatim from the prompt).

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("tree with no nameplate, its leaves shimmering emerald") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "narrative threads" and abstract constructions. The phrase "blissfully aberrant" appears twice, and several sentences begin with similar "She [verb]" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean, efficient prose with good momentum and no significant loops or scaffolding. Strong opening establishes voice and situation immediately. The description of the rope's "intricate braids that seemed to shift patterns when viewed from different angles" creates appropriate ambiguity without opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("ripple-mark mapkeeper" appears 7 times, "harmonic caves" 8 times) and template constructions ("They began studying," "They would learn"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly in the resolution sequence (-0.8 for pattern artifacts).

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the absence that spoke volumes, the gap between stars that held the secret to their paths"). However, several paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "coincidences were not random...threads connecting all moments" restates without advancement. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. Mixed metaphor muddles in "thistle-blown hope" filling a heart.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing about memory and identity ("sculpt identity from experience" appears twice verbatim) and overreliance on elevated diction. Lines like "ensuring that even after fog becomes solid, the memories it held would never truly be lost" restate rather than advance, creating paraphrase loops that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the climactic fireworks sequence with "purple that sang, green that whispered, gold that danced." Some redundancy appears in phrases like "forgotten lullaby" and "forgotten triumphs." Minor filter verb accumulation ("seemed to breathe," "seemed to lean") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "jade cicada" appears 11 times, "transition periods" 5 times, "tangential approach" 4 times creating synonym churn without added pressure. Template cadence runs throughout ("Maya's hand," "Maya's tidal-pool," "Maya considered," "Maya realized"). The paraphrase loop about time's texture repeats the same insight across multiple paragraphs without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive abstraction and redundancy weaken line-level execution: "intangibly tangible" appears twice, multiple paraphrase loops describe the same concepts ("something that could be felt in the soul but never truly captured"/"something intangibly tangible yet impossible to contain"), and overwrought constructions like "xenial trellis" and "gilded hush" prioritize ornament over clarity. The prose tells about transformation rather than enacting it through concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong control in sensory passages but suffers from repetitive sentence openings ("His name was," "His motivation was," "His practiced hands") and some abstract phrasing ("profound quiet," "inexplicable comfort"). The filter-verb clustering ("Elias believed," "Elias felt," "Elias watched") reduces immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose flows clearly but suffers from template cadence ("Elara approached," "Elara moved quickly," "she withdrew," "she stepped"). Multiple passages restate information ("unclaimed throne that had awaited a worthy ruler" appears twice with minimal variation). Figurative language occasionally strains ("earth dissolved politely"). While technically competent, the line-level craft lacks the precision and momentum that would elevate the story.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "memories turned to ash" but suffers from abstract phrasing ("loaded emptiness filled the sanctuary") and some template constructions ("With the first knock... With the second... With the third"). Information density is generally good but some passages loop conceptually without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose clarity suffers from overwriting in figurative language ("shadowseam wonder of the environment that made Maya feel she was walking through a living dream") and repetitive phrasing around the quantum promise concept. Multiple instances of template cadence appear ("Maya understood now," "Maya took a deep breath," "Maya carefully navigated"). The final paragraph contains explicit thematic summary that replaces scene pressure, violating show-don't-tell principles at the crucial closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues plague the prose: "eloquently silent" appears twice, "golden shadows" three times, "sepia reading room" four times, and the gramophone crank handle is mentioned eleven times with minimal variation. Multiple paragraphs restate the same information about resonance and truth without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates competent control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, particularly in the incantation "By pattern thought abandoned, by connection severed yet never broken." Information density is adequate, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or plot. However, several abstract declarations ("factually mystical," "immaterial truth") create opacity without payoff, and phrases like "shivering bliss" and "ethereal shadows" lean toward purple prose without earning their elevation through specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Eleanor," "Benjamin" appear excessively), abstract emotional language ("fractured journeys," "invisible threads"), and the typo "unfurred" for "unfurled" in the penultimate paragraph. Several sentences paraphrase rather than advance ("Small miracles that might otherwise go unrecorded" restates the previous line's content).

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from multiple template patterns and loops, particularly in the final paragraph's repetitive philosophical statements about memory and resistance. Phrases like "carefully resourceful rebel" and "tyranny of indifference" appear multiple times without evolution. The text includes corrupted characters ("theحراج'" and "вони laughedнебр") that break readability. Some sentences achieve propulsion ("Now Mara's carefully constructed plan began to unravel...") but scaffold and redundancy accumulate, especially in the closing.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive openings ("Ethan had performed," "Ethan recalled," "Ethan knew," "Ethan's notes," "Ethan felt") and abstract telling ("weighted with quietly vivid anticipation," "eerie nostalgia") rather than concrete embodiment. Template phrases like "made his way" and "filled him with" reduce specificity, though the musical passages show stronger imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is reasonable though some passages loop concepts ("transformation beginning within her" appears twice with minimal variation). The phrase "always emerges transformed always" creates an awkward repetition, and abstract descriptors like "mossy delight" and "sacred folklore" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean but suffers from template transitions ("From that day forward") and some abstract summarizing ("everything he had believed"). The makeshift ladder from clock parts is vivid. Several paraphrase loops around the uncertainty theme dilute momentum. Mixed metaphor with "beneath the ashes" appearing without clear vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with some strong imagery. Deductions for repetitive phrasing ("rain-washed" appears 6 times, "luminous regret" 3 times), and several abstract declarations that could be more concrete ("wisdom forged in failure"). Some sentences do multiple jobs well, but others merely restate.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flows cleanly but suffers from overwriting in places ("pockets heavy with whispered regrets"). Some metaphors strain ("crystallizing in the air like visible joy"). The text loops concept-heavy phrases about suffering and healing without always advancing the narrative. Information density is moderate - several sentences restate rather than deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "Kai" appears as sentence subject 11 times; "proprioceptive" variants repeat without advancing meaning. Abstract philosophical statements ("mercy had no mathematics," "mathematics of mercy") create loops rather than progression. Template cadence in "He/His" openings across multiple paragraphs dulls propulsion despite some vivid sensory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "between-worlds translator" appears 7 times, "anchors of intuition" 4 times, "elusively tangible" 4 times, creating template cadence. Multiple paraphrase loops exist ("I am simultaneously the child...and the adult" restates earlier content). The prose prioritizes atmospheric language over narrative momentum, with abstract declarations replacing concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose demonstrates solid craftsmanship with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "cracks in the façade" appears both literally and metaphorically without clear distinction; "weightless burden" repeats without evolution. The phrase "closing the cracks in the façade between worlds with acceptance instead of fear" attempts too much thematic work in one breath.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract declaratives ("reality had become negotiable," "the memories of worlds that never were") and template cadence in several passages. Lines like "watched in awe," "trembled as he placed," and "understood then" create predictable rhythms. The piece achieves moments of vivid imagery but loses momentum to conceptual abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments like "Time became visible, each second now a tangible thing that floated through the air like golden dust motes." However, template cadence appears in repetitive "Elias had" constructions, and some paraphrase loops occur ("defunct revolutionary"/"revolutionary flame"). The final paragraph contains mild synonym churn with "reimagined civilization" echoing earlier phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, especially during the restoration sequence. However, several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("the timeframe was in the balance," "reclaim the light stolen by midnight"). Some metaphors strain clarity—what exactly is "light" in this context remains vague despite repeated invocation.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, abstract phrases like "something fundamental had shifted" and "something ancient stirred" lack specificity, and the repetition of "hinged awakening" without variation creates mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "spirited driftwood sculptor" (3x), "timewoven alliances" (5x), "storm-tossed archway" (5x), "turbine-hum reverie" (4x), "magic lantern slide" (8x), "perpetually learning" (2x), "reimagine" (4x). These template phrases create mechanical cadence. Abstract language ("forever changed," "newfound understanding") replaces concrete imagery at crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing ("hidden layers," "hidden rhythms," "hidden symphony") and elevated register that obscures concrete action. Template cadence appears in "She traced...feeling...noticing how" construction, and the revelation paragraph relies on conceptual summary rather than embodied scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant scaffold and redundancy throughout: "solemn civil-rights archivist" appears twice verbatim, multiple paragraphs restate the diary's power without advancement. Template cadence pervades ("When... she," "As... Ellara," "The... had been"). The final third suffers from summary mode ("In the weeks that followed") rather than dramatized resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("deeper principles of connection and meaning") and repetitive conceptual loops about transformation and potential. Multiple sentences restate the same ideas about physical versus spiritual renewal without advancing pressure. The text relies heavily on telling rather than showing, particularly in the middle sections explaining Elior's realizations.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm during key moments. Information density is good when describing the wax cylinder interaction. However, several instances of telling over showing ("His motivation had shifted," "the experience deepened") and some repetitive phrasing around "emotional patterns" reduce momentum. The "velvet disquiet" feels forced as a prompt element.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without full payoff. Template phrasing emerges in "Anya began," "Anya reached," creating mild cadence monotony. The extended single-sentence paragraphs, while atmospheric, occasionally sacrifice clarity for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing about Elias's methods and observations—"meticulous care," "attentive listener," "intimate with every creak." Several sentences restate similar concepts without adding pressure: "His method had become an art form" followed by extended description of the same idea. The template cadence of "Elias [verb]" appears frequently enough to dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    Heavy reliance on abstract telling ("cosmic significance beyond mere physical disintegration," "profound calm that existed within the cataclysm") replaces concrete imagery. Template phrases like "forever changed" and "filled with the knowledge" create paraphrase loops that dull momentum, particularly in the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful variety in sentence structure and paragraph lengths creating visual rhythm. Strong moments like "releasing a single golden bee that circled three times before dissolving into moon-bleached air" show precise imagery. However, repetitive phrase patterns appear ("Through contextual clues" used three times, "astonished recluse" repeated), and some abstract phrasing ("tangible manifestation of a tangled covenant") lacks concrete specificity. Template cadence in middle sections dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant overwriting issues with abstract terminology ("temporal anomaly," "residual energy") and repetitive thematic assertions weaken momentum. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around time's texture and Elara's understanding. The final paragraph contains extensive scaffolding that restates rather than advances ("Time was hers to explore, to understand, and ultimately, to share").

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.4)
    While individual sentences are well-crafted, the story suffers from repetitive conceptual loops—multiple restatements of "harmonizing discord" and finding beauty in fragments without advancing pressure. Phrases like "another note in nature's symphony" and "bridge between realms" lean toward purple prose. The template cadence of "She [verb], [philosophical observation]" recurs throughout, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. However, multiple instances of abstract phrasing ("architectural secrets," "interspecies respect") appear without sufficient grounding, and there's template repetition in "The [noun] [verb]" openings across several paragraphs. The phrase "architectural secrets" appears four times with minimal variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical descriptions ("symphony of light and growth").

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant repetition issues plague the prose: "luminous skeptic" appears three times, "academically rebellious" three times, "chemistry of homecoming" five times, "bronze quiet" three times. These loops create a template feel. Overwriting appears throughout ("celestial confetti," "whispered invitations") without earning the elevated register through specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("had been," "would"), abstract descriptors ("narrow vastness," "fragile embrace"), and summary-heavy passages that tell rather than dramatize key moments. The line "ttk duelersi" appears to be an error, and several sentences paraphrase adjacent content without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "mechanical breathing of the community" and "jigsaw puzzle of desiccated earth." However, repetitive use of "wild hush" (4 times) and "tinted revelations" (3 times) creates pattern fatigue. Some adjacent sentences restate similar content ("For months, the cylinder sat untouched" followed immediately by explanation). The "arkadaş" usage feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=4.1)
    Severe repetition problems: "blessed pariah" concept appears in sentences 2, 11, and 19; "gilded compass rose" in 3, 9, 12, 18; "temporally stretched" perception in 4, 9, 15. Template cadence dominates with "She [verb]" or "Her [noun]" opening most sentences. Paraphrase loops abound—sentences 10-11 restate isolation/purpose, 13-14 repeat the preservation theme. The prose relies on abstract declarations ("keeper of memories," "bridge between what was and what could be") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows cleanly but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Kael had," "Kael approached," "Kael placed") and overreliance on telling rather than showing emotional states. Phrases like "apprentice of wonder" and "sacredly playful determination" feel forced rather than organic. The density could be higher - several passages restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("The single pawn seemed to pulse with the life force of all its missing companions") but suffers from repetitive conceptual phrasing around "small gestures" (appears 5 times) and "luminous absence" (3 times). The Chinese text error significantly damages the ending's momentum. Some sentences rely on abstract scaffolding ("the feeling of presence within emptiness, of memory within oblivion") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and maintains momentum, but suffers from abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy: "revelation struck Maven with the force of a blow" and "growing understanding" are telling rather than showing. Several paraphrase loops appear ("searching for something she couldn't name"/"to understand the shape of home"). The "hidden thunder" repetition works as pattern but some figurative language feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant paraphrase loops damage momentum: "frozen/suspended/locked," "time-frozen/stifled all time/time loosened its grip" repeat the same concepts. Template cadence appears in "His fingers fidgeted...His fingers trembled...His fingers flying." The prose reaches for literary effect with "woven hush" and "fierce repose" but these feel ornamental rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive conceptual loops about truth/refraction without advancing pressure, particularly in lines 14-16 which restate the same opposition. Abstract noun clusters ("absolutist beliefs," "subversive art," "prismatic language") reduce clarity. The phrase "had тайное mission" appears to contain a typo or encoding error. Information density is moderate but momentum stalls through philosophical restatement rather than scene advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("quilted memories together, patching the frayed tapestry") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences. Some redundancy emerges ("studying...with the intensity," "singular and consuming") and the extended sentences occasionally sacrifice momentum for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose achieves clarity and some memorable phrases ("intimately aloof," "porcelain impossibility"). However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("The cave's acoustics amplified his breath, each inhale and exhale becoming a meditation"). Template cadence appears in places ("Elias remembered... The nostalgic quay painter had... After the mirror cracked... Elias had always been..."). Information density varies significantly between sections.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=4.6)
    Significant paraphrase loops damage momentum: "pure intent"/"pure intention"/"purified intentions" cycles throughout; "whispers traveled farther than shouts" restates multiple times. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("tears of screaming tenderness welling in his eyes"). The prose tells rather than demonstrates key moments, particularly the sister's recognition and the captain's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("silver thread," "starlit signal station") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Template cadence appears in "The navigator watched... The navigator smiled... The navigator would build." Several abstract phrases like "primal instinct the navigator could sense but not explain" lack specificity. Information density varies, with some paragraphs restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several issues accumulate: repetitive "had [verb]" constructions, some paraphrase loops around the textbook descriptions, and occasional overwriting ("fractured grace of their post-virus world"). The ritual sequence shows strong momentum, but expository passages about the virus and textbooks create drag.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and selective sensory detail, particularly in rendering the twilight atmosphere and borrowed memories. However, several instances of elevated diction ("dreamscape of opalescence," "restless spirits") create register drift, and some transitions use template phrasing ("For days Elias experienced," "Determined to decode"). The opening and closing images effectively bookend with the nautical twilight.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Strong moments like "The dust that coated his shelves was a testament to solitude" show good information density. Minor issues include the abstract "empirically intuitive" construction and some telling around the transformation sequence that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several template phrases weaken momentum: "expression one of weary determination," "voice filled with ancient knowing," "newfound authority" (-0.6). The prose lacks density - many sentences do single jobs rather than layering meaning. Filter constructions like "she was surprised to find" dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several passages contain redundant phrasing ("Time seemed to compress and expand...the twilight deepening and brightening simultaneously") and abstract constructions that slow momentum. Strong moments like "hair the color of embers" and "pocket-suns hummed softly" demonstrate capable imagery. Template phrases appear ("As he approached," "In that moment"), and some sentences strain for profundity without advancing action ("understanding would come later, after processing").

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the vision sequence. However, abstract phrases like "terrifying beauty" and "cosmic storyteller" lack textural specificity. Some paraphrase loops appear ("every ending contained a beginning, every loss a discovery" restates "every grave was also a cradle").

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose demonstrates competent clarity but suffers from repetitive structures ("Elara once... Now she... Her fingers, once trained...") and abstract emotional telling ("heart lighter," "warmth spread"). The metaphorical framework of water/time/transition occasionally strains ("vessels of human stories"), and several sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some redundancy appears ("telltale prickle of crystallization beginning" followed by "crystallization halting"). Template phrasing clusters around "she [verb]" constructions and some elevated diction ("saturated hush") feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and effective rhythm, particularly in atmospheric passages. Information density is adequate though some descriptions feel ornamental ("intricate silver filigree"). Minor issues include the awkward "gossip-column exorcist" compound that repeats without variation, and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages that don't advance the story.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=4.4)
    Overwriting pervades with phrases like "monumental location that contained the memories of civilizations yet unborn" and "pure consciousness suspended in infinite potential and absolute determination." Template mystical diction ("ancient temple," "forgotten knowledge," "cosmic understanding") replaces specificity. The prose tells about paradoxes ("journeying inward while walking out") without dramatizing them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("eminently peculiar" appears three times, "razor edges" four times) and abstract philosophical statements that slow momentum. The counting sequence (One through Five) creates structure but the observations within each beat remain vague ("somehow felt different," "unexpected patterns") rather than concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several instances of overwriting strain clarity: "quiet wildfire, burning without smoke, consuming everything yet making no sound" and repetitive constructions like "revolutionary her understanding"/"revolutionize not just intrusion detection." The prose achieves moments of vivid specificity but suffers from abstract philosophy ("mathematics of boundaries," "physics of letting go") that slows momentum. Some template phrasing in emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("cardiac interruption that had made time both precious and dangerous") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "lucid contradictions" and "theoretically rebellious." The filter-heavy construction "she realized with a thrill that warred with professional skepticism" dulls immediacy. Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly the redundant explanations of probability versus gambling.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "glass harmonica disc" appears 16 times, "between the hum of streetlamps" 7 times, creating mechanical loops rather than purposeful pattern. Multiple paraphrase loops occur: "cultivated estrangement" restated as "carefully maintained," "fortress of solitude." Template cadence runs throughout ("Elias had been," "Elias would," "Elias believed"). These artifacts pervade the final third, dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "weight of small moments" concepts repeat without advancement, and phrases like "haunted euphoria" recur identically. The prose achieves moments of clarity ("wildflowers of violet and crimson poked through weathered wooden planks") but suffers from abstract philosophizing that replaces concrete action, particularly in the middle sections where reflection dominates scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose clarity suffers from repetitive structures ("Archie would," "Archie watched," "Archie began") and abstract summary language ("meticulously constructed," "wildest of rumors"). The piece relies heavily on telling through temporal jumps rather than scene-level density. Some effective touches like "waves of ivy" and "spray-painted silver" moon rock provide specificity, but overall information density is low.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract loops and synonym churn: "emotional depths/emotional landscapes," "quiet blaze" repeated without evolution, "stillpoint" used 11 times. Template phrasing appears in peak moments ("Tears fell sightless from his eyes"). The final third especially relies on abstract declaration over concrete image, with multiple instances of telling what should be shown.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from abstraction ("fragments of history waiting to be decoded") and repetitive structures. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the concept of editing history, and filter phrases like "Elara felt" and "she knew" dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.7)
    Line-level craft shows moments of beauty but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "silence," "mapping," and "joyful sorrow." Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum (paragraphs about translating silence repeat similar concepts). The opening and closing sentences effectively bookend the piece, though middle sections occasionally stall through conceptual redundancy rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant momentum loss occurs through summary passages ("For weeks, she followed...," "Years passed...") that compress what should be dramatized beats. Template cadence appears in repetitive "Maya [verb]" constructions, and the phrase "volcanic tenderness" repeats without evolving meaning, creating a loop artifact that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("pregnant with potential that scientists had learned to capture"). However, several paraphrase loops appear ("quiet rebellion" repeated three times with minimal variation) and some abstract conceptual language dulls immediacy. The final paragraph contains explicit thematic statements that could trust more in dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows competent variety in sentence structure and maintains momentum, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("towering labyrinth," "eerie resonance," "arcane ritual"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("whispered instructions" followed by explaining the whisper technique), and figurative density in places dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.7)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "The guardian" starts 8 sentences, "shutters" appears 10 times, variations of "pattern" occur 9 times. Template cadence in middle section ("The visitor stopped... The guardian didn't turn... The shutters clicked..."). Some evocative imagery but information density is low - many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues: "forests of second thoughts" (4x), "cobalt" (5x), extensive paraphrase loops ("watching children think about the world through the chessboard" followed immediately by similar content). Template cadence pervades action sequences, and abstract phrases like "revolutionary nature of their work" replace concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("pieces of scrimshaw began to detach, floating before her like fragments of liquid moonlight") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("great emptiness," "barriers within herself") and some redundancy in describing transformation stages. Template phrasing appears in emotional description ("heart a battlefield of hope and fear"). Information density is moderate; several sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm in the performer's narrations. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "remade hush—stillness within motion, silence within sound" restates without advancing. Template cadence appears in the "Some called him...Others called him" construction and filter-heavy passages like "he would sometimes touch" dilute immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing dulls momentum: "boundaries between reality and imagination beginning to thin," "vibration that transcended sound and became pure sensation," "tapestry of interconnected moments." Template mystical language ("ancient craftsmanship," "sacred knowledge," "newfound freedom") and repetitive structure across paragraphs create monotony without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.6)
    Several sentences suffer from overwriting: "innocently cunning painter who had lost all color perception the day the phoenix first touched the sky" could be tighter. Template phrasing appears in "had learned the hard way" and "knew better than to." The final paragraph contains three sentences exceeding 50 words, creating density without proportional payoff. However, key images like the reed tongue "catching light like trapped phoenix fire" land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues: "powerfully gentle" appears 5 times, "golden shadows" 4 times, "texture of connection" 4 times, creating template cadence. The phrase "artificial pilgrimage" and variants of "questioning assumptions" recur mechanically. Information density suffers from conceptual loops that restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure and appropriate rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops weaken density: "helping others navigate their grief with compassion" followed by teaching "withering to bloom again" restates without advancement. The phrase "curtains of intention" appears three times without evolving meaning. Template cadence emerges in the parallel "She was/She would" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and atmospheric descriptions, but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts ("reverse engineering" appears 3 times, "steadily curious" twice). Several passages contain abstract exposition that could be more concretely embodied ("the underlying structures of human consciousness that silently shaped history"). The measuring tape's "brass edges polished by generations" and cards' "onyx-ink" provide good textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure and appropriate rhythm shifts. Major line-level issues include repetitive "she [verb]" constructions (lines 11, 15, 17, 20), abstract emotional labeling ("anguished joy" appears twice unchanged), and some purple patches ("constellation" of atoms). Information density is moderate but several sentences merely restate rather than advance ("experiencing their end of innocence firsthand" after showing this).

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("shadows stretched and deepened across the endless rows") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around the shadow's movements and multiple instances of abstract emotional labeling ("luminous regret" appears three times). The paraphrase loop in paragraphs 18-19 about Elara's continued vigil dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=4.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("reconstruction" appears in various forms across four separate beats; the "shedding layers" metaphor repeats without advancement). Template cadence runs ("Elara knew...", "Elara smiled...", "Elara had...") and abstract diction ("larger story of who she was becoming") dull immediacy without serving pattern or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades the text: "Elara understood/realized" appears multiple times, "displaced miracle" repeats five times without evolution, and template constructions like "The [object] [verb]" dominate. Abstract declarations replace concrete imagery in crucial beats: "forever changed," "creator of new beginnings." The paraphrase loop between "closure seeker who opened wounds" and "opening wounds instead of healing them" exemplifies the redundancy that dulls momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues pervade: "crystal gazer" appears 7 times, "unused love" 5 times, "spatially imaginative/imagined" 4 times, creating synonym churn rather than accumulation. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("While forgotten lyrics...," "While others..."). The prose achieves moments of clarity but scaffolding and loops (-0.8) prevent higher scoring despite some strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe overwriting pervades with figurative language in nearly every sentence ("moonstruck face," "hungry for the stars," "cosmic inheritance"). Template cadence runs throughout ("She lifted... She had come... She would return..."). Abstract nominalizations proliferate ("nebulous concepts," "infinite voices," "manageable beauty") without concrete anchors, creating density without clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from template cadence in middle sections ("He checked...," "He placed...," "He stepped...") triggering -0.5. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the "cultivate sparks" concept repeated without added pressure. Information density varies; some sentences do multiple jobs while others merely restate. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with charged imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from repetitive concept-cycling around consciousness, frontier, and understanding. Lines like "the wild frontier of his mind" appear four times with minimal variation. Some passages lean heavily on abstract descriptors ("rivers of emotional light") rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("waves licking stone beneath them") but suffers from repetitive mystical descriptors and abstract spatial markers. Several paraphrase loops appear ("where unused courage waits unused," "wise ferry guides...guides"). The piece maintains forward momentum despite occasional overwriting, though phrases like "where time flowed backward and sideways" lack concrete grounding that would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though several template constructions appear ("The bellhop understood...The bellhop could remain...The bellhop realized"). Some figurative density in non-peak moments ("ethereal blue light that matched the fortress walls") without clear payoff. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=5.4)
    Repetitive phrase structures weaken momentum ("As weeks turned to months," "As she prepared," "As the world reformed"). Abstract language proliferates in peak beats ("manifestation of Elara's own fear," "burden of expectation"). The prose relies on telling over showing, particularly in the revelation sequence where conceptual summary replaces dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful repetition of the tapping motif. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "paths—both physical and metaphorical—disappeared" restates the torn atlas discovery; "drifting, disconnected" and later "drifting and moored" repeat without advancement. The final paragraph contains excessive abstract summary about planetary cycles.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=4.6)
    Severe repetition issues pervade: "abandoned" appears 4 times, "ancient stone(s)/circle" 7 times, "vintage opera glasses" 5 times. Template cadence runs throughout ("She had come... She knew... She clutched..."). The prose suffers from abstract inflation ("revolution of the spirit," "language of the universe itself") and multiple paraphrase loops, particularly around the stones' humming energy described three different ways without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is adequate with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. However, there's noticeable template cadence in the middle section ("Maya had accidentally discovered... The plants had shown her... This discovery had awakened") and some filter-verb clustering that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("crumpled photograph, its edges soft with repeated caresses") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Maya had," "Maya would") and abstract summaries. The phrase "to anchor optimism in realism" appears verbatim twice, creating unnecessary loops.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose demonstrates solid craftsmanship with varied sentence structure and evocative imagery. However, several passages contain ornamental metaphors that don't advance pressure ("like scattered puzzle pieces," "tiny stars," "puppet strings"), and there's occasional redundancy in emotional description. The rhetorical questions, while atmospheric, sometimes function as scaffolding rather than propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance the narrative. However, there's some repetition around the tracker's albinism (mentioned 4+ times) and occasional redundancy like "whirred silently" or explaining what's already shown ("This was their method—not invisibility, but temporal displacement").

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "echoing library under snow" appears 5 times, "contraband truths" 4 times, "dangerous liaison letter" 4 times, "bravely conflicted" twice, "dizzying quiet" 3 times. These prompt-element repetitions create mechanical cadence. Some effective moments ("a million tiny crystals creating a perfect blanket") are undermined by the overall repetitive structure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from telling over showing ("Rhiannon believed that every living thing craved meaning") and repetitive abstract claims about her methods. Phrases like "botanical artistry" and "fractured world" recur without deepening. However, some passages achieve clarity and momentum, particularly the physical descriptions of her gardening work.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract density and repetitive phrasing: "sleepwalking constellations" appears four times, multiple sentences begin with "The fisher" or "He," and abstract concepts like "beautiful dissolution" and "divine resonance" replace concrete imagery. The template cadence "He worked by... Each movement was... Each silent utterance..." creates mechanical rhythm that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("devotedly observant" appears three times, "echoing observatory above clouds" four times) and template constructions that create monotony. While grammatically clean, the writing relies on abstract descriptors and summary statements ("Hours passed as Eleanor worked") that reduce momentum, with several paragraphs removable without losing essential information.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("hands as steady as the stars he inked") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in the discovery sequence ("Elias had discovered... Inside, handwritten letters revealed..."). The filter-verb stack in the emotional climax ("Tears streamed... had restored... had quieted") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates solid control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between action and reflection. Template cadence appears in the extended ending ("Together they built...Silas watched...When exhaustion finally") and abstract phrases like "emergent hush" and "lilac unease" recur without gaining specificity, creating some textural redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("shattered sky," "cathedral ceiling open to stars") but suffers from repetitive constructions and abstract phrasing. Multiple sentences begin with "Elias" or "His," creating monotonous rhythm. Phrases like "revolutionary kindness" and "aberrant mercy" repeat without variation. The text occasionally tells what could be shown, particularly in describing the plaza's response to the naming.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and evocative imagery. Some figurative density in peak moments ("ribbons of colored light," "symphony of scents," "bloomed like flowers") and occasional abstract phrasing ("fractured timeline," "temporal fragments") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.4)
    Extensive repetition plagues the prose: "fractally precise" appears 5 times, "willowglass hope" 3 times, "static shock" referenced redundantly. Template cadence runs throughout ("Maya [verb]," "She [verb]"). The phrase "motivation to illuminate hidden pathways" repeats verbatim multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, particularly effective in the descent sequence. Some redundancy appears in explaining the thermal mapping system and the fossil's significance. Phrases like "truly factually mystical phenomenon" feel forced, and the final paragraph contains unnecessary summary ("The reborn world above would soon learn") that could trust more in the image.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive template cadence ("Elara turned... Elara felt... Elara knew... Elara taught...") creates mechanical rhythm throughout. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around shared wisdom and transformation concepts restated across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments of compression and rhythm variation, particularly in shorter declarative sentences that punctuate longer reflective passages. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("fixing what's broken" appears four times with minimal variation), and abstract phrases like "prudently daring" repeat without embodiment. Some metaphors strain (courage as something that "waits" in a location).

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from abstract phrasing that obscures concrete action: "stretched the fabric of reality through ambient awareness" and "distill complexity into essence" read as conceptual scaffolding. Repetitive structure emerges in middle paragraphs ("The coachman..." opening multiple sentences). Some effective rhythm variation and strong sensory specificity partially compensate.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several template repetitions weaken momentum: "by following sun patterns" appears verbatim three times, "sharp gentleness" three times, and the "chimney smoke...flattening" image twice without evolution. The density is high but these loops prevent entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Strong moments like "The water shimmered like liquid mercury" create atmosphere. However, several phrases feel overwritten ("ethereal by the night," "quivering hush of the evening"), and some repetition occurs ("quivering hush" appears twice). The opening and closing images bookend effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of genuine beauty ("books flowing in and out on currents of knowledge") but suffers from repetitive constructions and abstract declarations. Several paraphrase loops appear (awakening descriptions repeat similar content), and some figurative language lacks precision ("phantoms of all her former selves dancing"). The filter-verb density in reflective passages dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition undermines momentum: "lotus temple" (9x), "keeper of secrets" (5x), "inevitably whimsical" (4x), "prismatic quiet" (4x), "thrush's nest twig spiral" (5x). Template cadence runs through "She had..." constructions. Mixed metaphors appear ("thread that connects all things" vs "web of existence"). These artifacts pervade the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from telling over showing ("terrifying efficiency," "cautiously hopeful"), repetitive sentence structures, and abstract descriptors. Multiple paraphrase loops appear (lines about community division repeat the same idea), and the week-later summary deflates momentum rather than maintaining scene pressure through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures, though some overwriting appears ("claustrophobic explorer" as an oxymoronic label, "viscous" air feeling forced). The phrase "blueprint drafting compass point" repeats awkwardly multiple times. Information density is adequate but several passages tell what could be shown, particularly around the Great Sealing backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose demonstrates competent clarity but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Elena" appears 11 times) and template cadence in investigation sequences. Several paraphrase loops occur, particularly around the masquerade/mask descriptions. The final paragraph's abstract moralizing ("Justice has been dormant...empathy never truly disappears") abandons concrete imagery for conceptual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues: "experimental weather station" appears 5 times, "shipwrecked journals" 4 times, "nervously confident/nervous confidence" twice. Template structure in paragraphs 13-15 ("The panel responded..." "The idealistic map librarian..." "The spongey dread..."). These loops and scaffolds significantly impede momentum, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "scaffold wrap flutters" appears seven times, "pixelated amnesty" four times, "luminous disbelief" three times. Abstract descriptors proliferate ("cosmic language," "symphony of pixelated amnesty") without concrete grounding. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("The scaffold wrap flutters intensified... The scaffold wrap flutters formed wings... The scaffold wrap flutters settled"). Information density suffers from paraphrase loops that restate transformation concepts without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose remains clean but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts ("polished calm" appears 4 times, "perceptively calm" 5 times, "dusky harmony" 3 times). Multiple paragraphs begin with character names in subject position. Information density is moderate—many sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle sections. The line "Why some paths circle back" gets recycled verbatim, creating a loop artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from exposition-heavy passages ("For weeks, the same recurring vision had tormented her") and abstract summaries ("emotional and spiritual restoration"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "understanding dawned"/"understanding was dawning"/"understanding dawning." Template phrasing pervades ("She had witnessed...she had found...she had always been").

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues plague the prose: "warlike serenity" appears 5 times, "expanding circles" 4 times, "flesh-eating plant seed" 8 times, "swirling orchard vortex" 5 times. Template cadence runs throughout ("The druid...", "She..."). The final paragraph consists entirely of abstract theme statements that should have been dramatized. These artifacts significantly dull momentum and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstract phrasing that obscures concrete action ("linking through scars, connecting the wounds of the past"). Multiple passages restate similar concepts without advancing pressure. The writing favors conceptual exposition over sensory immediacy, creating distance between reader and scene.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing patterns ("Elara [verb]" structures dominate) and filter-verb clusters ("she saw again," "seemed to breathe"). The typo "укрепed" breaks immersion. Information density is adequate but several paragraphs restate rather than advance ("fierce gentleness" appears twice with similar context).

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues damage momentum: "discovering purpose after loss" appears verbatim twice, "echo valley" three times, and "after the applause" becomes a refrain without earning pattern status. Template phrasing like "Marcus found himself" and "left him feeling" creates distance. The prose achieves clarity but lacks the density and variety needed for higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive "had been/had [verb]" constructions throughout, creating template cadence. Several paragraphs could be cut without losing information (the extended analogical thinking section adds little pressure). Overwriting appears in phrases like "haunted ambitions" and "luminous entity," though clarity remains intact. The paraphrase loop between "that time had come" and similar restatements dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy bog down momentum: "The librarian watched the waxing and waning of identity's tide within themselves" immediately follows similar content about lunar identity shifts. Template cadence appears in "The librarian [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion, with multiple passages restating the same concepts about preservation and identity.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("fear manifested in steel and concrete") but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"resonant hush" appears three times, "abandoned hopes" four times, "latent radiance" three times. The "During the heartbeat of a hesitation" construction appears twice identically. Information density varies; some sentences do multiple jobs while others restate ("she would seek out those whose light had dimmed, whose hopes had been abandoned").

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose shows strong moments ("ivy that clawed at brickwork like desperate fingers") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "self-forgiveness" (appears 6 times) and abstract constructions. Some sentences meander without clear propulsion, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("Elena moved toward," "She studied"). The "市政府" appears without explanation, suggesting a proofing error.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("The library was alive...all preserved here" restates the same concept) and abstract summary replacing scene work. Template cadence appears in repetitive "They [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Some strong images ("walls that seemed made of condensed mist") are undermined by vague abstractions ("something extraordinary, something caution had almost prevented").

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong imagery. Deductions for density issues: overlapping metaphors ("fruit left too long on the branch" feels disconnected) and some abstract phrasing ("fragile seedling" for motivation). The "chaotic水下摄影" appears to be a technical error. Some sentences could be tightened for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm during the ritual sequence. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "capturing these fleeting impressions" followed by "captured moments," and repetitive use of "captured" throughout dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("quest was personal—a search for that which she had not found"), template cadence in movement descriptions, and abstract assertions replacing concrete imagery. Multiple filter-verb stacks and conceptual redundancy around "contentment/peace/understanding" dilute impact. The final paragraph's abstract claim lacks grounding imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages describing the wind chimes. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("hollow mirror shard felt heavier than usual, as if absorbing the weight of secrets") and some paraphrase loops ("welcomed nuance into certainty" appears multiple times). The filter-heavy construction occasionally dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant repetition issues plague the prose: "vanishing to appear" appears six times, "sycamore hush" three times, "floating rock platform" five times, creating a loop effect. While some repetition serves the meditative atmosphere, lines like "To teach vanishing to appear was to teach the ultimate paradox of existence" read as scaffolding that explains rather than dramatizes.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing weakens line-level craft: "something nameless within his spirit," "mysteries that had eluded scholars for generations," "reaching places without taking steps." Template mystical cadence appears throughout ("Through centuries of layered dust," "From his tunic," "With weathered resolve"). The prose relies on telling about profound concepts rather than creating information density through concrete action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple instances of paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "yearned to find the sacred in the simple, to discover wonder" restates the same desire; "not bright but profound, illuminating not surfaces but possibilities" circles the same concept. Abstract telling dominates key moments ("Images flooded his mind") rather than concrete dramatization. The prose relies on conceptual binaries (automated/authentic, standardized/organic) that become repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("threads of starlight and seawater"). Some passages in the library sequence contain slight density issues with stacked metaphysical descriptions. The opening and closing paragraphs demonstrate strong rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive structures and phrases. "Quiet enthusiasm" and "stellar doubt" become loops rather than purposeful repetition. Several sentences begin with character names followed by simple past tense verbs. The phrase "wavelength align with purpose" appears twice without clear meaning, suggesting template language.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some overwriting appears ("shadows made solid," "echo of sacrifice resonated") but doesn't obscure meaning. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story or atmosphere. Template phrases like "For the first time in centuries" and "Somewhere in the realm between worlds" reduce originality but don't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows control but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "brittle devotion" (appears 4 times) and overuse of "lukewarm" (8 instances). Several passages edge toward purple prose ("settling stars," "liquid sky"). The final paragraph contains unnecessary scaffolding that restates themes rather than letting the image speak.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Minor issues include "had, until now, unwittingly upheld" (awkward insertion) and occasional elevated diction ("precisely humane approach") that borders on template language. The opening and closing images connect effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "harmonize logic and intuition" appears four times with minimal variation, "before the final transformation" repeats three times without advancing meaning, and "touch of wonder" recycles without deepening. Template phrases like "auburn hair" bookend the piece mechanically, and several sentences restate rather than advance ("watching as it neither melted nor cracked but transformed" followed immediately by "This was the touch of wonder she had been seeking").

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe repetition issues: "The parachute buckle" opens four separate paragraphs, "The watcher's burden" appears twice, "Attentively inventive" twice, "Remembering through muscle memory" twice, "After the radio static cleared" twice. These template patterns and paraphrase loops drain momentum. The prose tells about urgency ("heart quicken with dread") rather than embodying it through syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.6)
    Pervasive exposition and concept-stacking create density without propulsion: "the fundamental dualities that underpinned reality itself and allowed for creation" exemplifies the abstract register that dominates. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around Maya's numbness and the consciousness themes, while filter-heavy constructions ("she could see," "she knew") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "notably receptive" appears three times, "storm-born silence" three times, "orthogonal" four times, "safeguard space for innovation" three times. Template cadence pervades: "Elara [verb]" structures dominate. The prose loops conceptually—multiple paragraphs restate the same creativity philosophy without advancing action or deepening meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=4.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops damage momentum: "mournfully eager" appears four times; "after the final grain" three times; variations on silence/quiet/stillness recycle throughout. Template cadence pervades ("He didn't...instead, he"; "He poured...He imagined"). The phrase "tending to the unspoken" repeats verbatim three times without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract density without concrete anchoring - "interiorizing exteriors" appears four times without clear dramatization of the practice. Template cadence emerges in "The guardian... The garden... The pendant..." openings. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: the guardian simultaneously experiences "foggy lucidity" while having "expanded to another density." Information density is uneven, with the middle section cycling through conceptual descriptions rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "hopeless alchemist" concept restated in lines 13 and 23; the creative destruction theme explicitly stated then restated. Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("The first attempt...The second attempt"). Overwriting in phrases like "melancholy beauty" and "ancient wisdom and tragic despair" slows critical beats. The prose achieves moments of clarity but scaffold and loops prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elara stood," "Elara's motivation," "Elara knew," "Elara held," "Elara smiled") and abstract descriptors ("latent energy," "profound silence," "cosmic pathways"). The phrase "serenely electric" appears twice verbatim, suggesting template language.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("spectral grotto under starlight" appears verbatim three times) and template constructions ("Liam [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs). Several passages contain paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate without advancing ("The ferry began its transformation...Passengers waiting at the docks would see nothing but empty water"). Information density remains moderate with missed opportunities for compression.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, abstract phrasing like "texture of connection" and "rational enchantment" recurs without gaining specificity. Several passages contain conceptual redundancy ("emotions trapped within the threads began to erupt, manifesting as phantom figures"). The ending particularly suffers from telling rather than embodying its revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from summary-heavy passages that tell rather than dramatize key developments ("Weeks passed as the instructor developed his method"). Multiple instances of abstract declaration ("The process was meditative") replace concrete scene work. The breakthrough moment arrives through telling rather than lived experience, dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose has moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive use of "reeling hush" (3x) and some overwrought phrasing ("mist-clad atrium," "ethereal fog"). Information density is uneven - some paragraphs advance multiple story elements while others feel padded. The phrase "persistently curious" appears twice verbatim, creating unnecessary echo.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures, though several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy ("yawned before her like a tired giant," "fibrous veins"). Information density is adequate but some passages tell rather than dramatize (lines about Dr. Thorne). The final image lands cleanly without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("finding wisdom in what should have been my end" restates the motivation). Template cadence appears in "I see it now," "I adjust my focus," "I gather the papers." The phrase "death certificate error survivor" repeats four times without variation or purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure and appropriate rhythm. Some passages edge toward purple prose ("towers of bone that rose like ancient sentinels," "twilight painted the canyon in hues of lavender and gold"). Information density could be higher—several paragraphs restate rather than advance. The phrase "glyphs of texture made audible" feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("harmony untamed" concept repeated without added pressure) and abstract descriptors ("profound," "impossible conditions"). The final third relies on conceptual summary rather than concrete imagery. Template phrases like "couldn't help but smile" and "weighed heavy in their pocket" reduce specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows moments of genuine beauty ("crystalline fruit, its roots glowing with captured moonlight") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts (multiple uses of "resonantly soft," "heart rhythms"). Some template cadence in the middle section ("She began playing... She knew the secret... She reached"). Information density is moderate with most sentences doing single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("lightning occasionally casting shadows across his weathered face") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. The phrase "respectfully rebellious" appears twice verbatim, and constructions like "a detail not lost in Elias's months of careful observation" feel unnecessarily complex. The final third improves with cleaner, more propulsive sentences, though some scaffold remains ("As Elias walked on through the twilight").

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive use of "misting hush" (4 times) and "whispering gleam" (3 times) creating synonym churn, while phrases like "infinite possibility" and "sanctuary and their voice" lean abstract. The story maintains momentum but includes scaffolding phrases ("For hours, they examined") and some mixed metaphors (halo fragment as "sibling" to wind bells) that muddy clarity without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.2)
    Significant repetition issues damage momentum: "tattered silk scarf" appears 7 times, "hyperbolic" 8 times, "analog memories" 4 times, creating template cadence. Phrases like "sanely eccentric" and "patrons browsed" recur mechanically. However, sentence variety exists and no mixed metaphors obscure meaning. The repetition of key phrases reads more like scaffold than purposeful pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and some lovely phrases ("the islands' murmurs softening as the first rays painted the sky"), though several passages edge toward overwriting ("vitalize the images," "cipher of longing"). The story avoids major loops but contains some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("twilight painted the sky in shades of indigo and lavender") but suffers from abstract phrasing and occasional overwriting. Template constructions appear ("Silas removed," "Silas murmured," "Silas closed") creating repetitive stems. The phrase "unassumingly bold" forces the required attribute awkwardly twice. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others drift into abstraction like "threshold moment that existed between heartbeats."

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates solid clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and discovery moments. However, template phrases accumulate: "Elara traced," "Elara approached," "Elara knelt," creating mechanical cadence. Abstract telling dominates key beats: "Understanding washed over her with sharp clarity" summarizes rather than dramatizes the pivotal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some figurative density in places ("combative tenderness," "reversible exile technique") approaches overwriting without quite crossing the line. The playground swing metaphor feels slightly forced but doesn't obstruct clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive template repetition dulls momentum: "wise orchard pruner" appears 7 times, creating drumbeat rhythm. Abstract language ("weaving between worlds," "capturing essence," "preserve the color of wonder") repeats without gaining specificity. Filter constructions proliferate ("she felt," "seemed to," "began to"). The prose prioritizes elevated diction over clarity, with vague mystical terminology never becoming concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("net coiled like the shed skin of some ancient sea beast") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts ("interlaced hush" appears four times, "sanctuary" eight times). Some sentences strain for effect ("tumbled from his lips into the quiet sanctuary") rather than maintaining momentum. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others restate without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves clarity but suffers from template phrasing ("For months, Elara had been," "As she studied," "It was as if"). Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around Elara's methodology being "methodically curious" and her "perceptive" nature as a "perceptive map framer." The final paragraphs contain unnecessary scaffolding that restates rather than advances meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and controlled rhythm. Information density is moderate, with most sentences advancing atmosphere or theme. However, several passages contain abstract scaffolding ("sophisticated, almost beautiful in its clarity") and some repetitive phrasing around "understanding" and "untangling" that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows with intentional rhythm but suffers from density issues - figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern or payoff (-0.5). Template cadence emerges in parallel structures ("Their conversations became..." "Each note she sang..." "Through their unique connection...") and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("encrypted diary"/"encrypted text"/"symbols," repeated "scattered light" phrases, "joy beneath anguish" variations). The untranslated Chinese character "化作" is a critical error. Template cadence appears in the floor-by-floor structure without sufficient variation, though some sentences achieve lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive paraphrase loops plague the prose: "empty spaces remember" concept is restated multiple times without advancement; "quietly explosive" appears twice identically; multiple sentences reiterate Elena as interpreter/translator of clouds. Template cadence runs throughout ("Elena believed," "Elena felt," "She began"). The final paragraph especially suffers from abstract restatement rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose has moments of strong specificity ("fractally precise mapping system") but suffers from occasional abstract phrasing ("heightened stillness," "boundaries of perception"). Some redundancy in conceptual statements about seeing patterns versus faces. The final image achieves clarity but middle sections contain mild conceptual loops about perception and recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "diligently curious"/"meticulously curious," "next great discovery" appears four times, "stranded luminance" six times without variation. Template constructions proliferate: "Eli knelt," "Eli retrieved," "Eli began," "Eli traced," "Eli carefully replaced," "Eli looked forward." The prose tells more than shows, particularly in emotional beats where we get labels ("trembling fingers," "heart racing") rather than embodied perception.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues - "hauntingly bright clockmaker's gear assortment" appears verbatim four times, "through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner" three times. These loops damage momentum. Prose is competent but relies on template fantasy diction. Information density suffers from redundant descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "floating rock arches" appears four times, "strangers to/became family" three times. Template constructions like "The messages always contained..." and "The ghost's chalked messages now instructed..." create mechanical rhythm. The prose achieves clarity but lacks the density and variation needed for this length—many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows ambition with varied sentence structures and rich imagery. However, abstract language accumulates heavily ("nested patterns of concentration," "subsonic vibration," "cosmic defense") without sufficient concrete anchoring. The phrase "beautifully flawed" appears four times, creating unnecessary repetition. Some sentences strain under their conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Elias [verb]" appears 20+ times) and several paraphrase loops, particularly around the curse/blessing transformation restated multiple times in the ending. Filter constructions like "Elias knew" appear frequently. The "graceless beauty" and "offhandedly exact" phrases feel forced into repetition rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is adequate with most sentences advancing character or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("seeking solace in nature's patterns" followed by similar restatements) and some filter constructions dull immediacy ("She began designing," "She would smile, remembering"). Template cadence appears in the final third with repetitive "She/Her" openings.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("bottles containing different phases of moonlight—harvested, as per parole conditions, by quantifying absence") but suffers from repetitive structures. "The vendor" appears 19 times, creating template cadence. Several paraphrase loops exist: the glass orchard library description recurs without advancement. Information density is moderate; some sentences do multiple jobs while others merely restate.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing around "stored remorse" (5 instances) and "emotionally contagious" (3 instances) without variation, creating synonym churn. Template cadence appears in sequences like "Kael focused...Kael felt...Kael approached...Kael did not shrink." The final paragraph summarizes the transformation ("Hours passed...until finally") rather than rendering it with specific imagery, losing momentum at the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is clean but suffers from summary-heavy passages that flatten momentum ("The method worked beautifully," "unexpected results"). Multiple paragraphs could be cut without losing essential information. Figurative language like "beacon of history and hope" and "borrowed starlight" feels decorative rather than purposeful, though no major artifacts obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant template cadence issues: "The engineer's helix-mind began," "The engineer saw," "The engineer had not merely" creates mechanical rhythm. Paraphrase loops appear ("profound transformation" repeated three times, "abandoned dreams" five times). Abstract phrasing like "chaotically precise" and "quaking reverie" substitutes for concrete description. These artifacts touch the closure, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant repetition issues pervade the text: "prism-minded archivist" appears 6 times, "clandestinely luminous" 4 times, "latent blaze" 4 times, creating template cadence. The phrase "seeds of vigilance" repeats 5 times without evolving meaning. Abstract descriptors like "forgotten combinations" and vague quantities ("years," "generations") reduce specificity. These artifacts touch the closure beat, preventing higher scores.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and sensory density. However, several instances of elevated diction ("symphonically minded," "empathy in motion") and some repetitive phrasing around the sculpture's music reduce momentum. The phrase "empathy in motion" appears twice, creating a minor loop.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("traced the dent in his polished basalt worry stone") but suffers from repetitive phrase structures ("Elias was thoughtfully precise" appears verbatim twice). Some abstract phrasing ("hopeful melancholy transformed into resolute acceptance") dulls immediacy in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from significant redundancy—"shadowed workshop under stars" appears verbatim three times, and concepts like "theatrical sincerity" and "eclectic pacifist" repeat without evolution. Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("The path to empathy required this level of dedication, this willingness to feel what others felt"), and abstract declarations replace concrete imagery in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant prose issues undermine momentum. Template phrases proliferate: "navigated...with practiced ease," "promised both knowledge and danger," "quiet confidence that comes from." The phrase "olfactorily sensitive" appears three times unchanged. Paraphrase loops dilute key moments—the seed's nature is explained multiple ways without added pressure. The text reads as overwrought with abstract flourishes ("wildflower hush," "undercurrent of wisdom") that obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some strong imagery. Multiple instances of repetitive phrasing weaken momentum: "whirling silence" appears three times, "Arion" opens too many sentences, and filter constructions like "Arion saw" and "Arion knew" dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing around Elena's "rapidly adapting" nature (appears 4 times) and overuse of "singular convergence" without variation. Lines like "Her motivation went beyond solving this mystery; Elena was determined to cultivate foresight in action" tell rather than demonstrate through action, while several passages loop similar observations about wind patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high but uneven—some sentences beautifully integrate action and perception while others stack modifiers heavily ("ethereal greens and pinks to vibrant blues and purples"). Template cadence appears in the bell-striking sequence ("As she continued... Through the colors... The cavern began"). The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but lacks consistent propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("Gold etchings glimmered along its length") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("As a driven relic keeper," "As a method for navigating") and abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy. The compound adjective "avalanchingly quiet" appears twice, creating unnecessary echo.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the transfer sequence. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "mathematics of emotion" and "equations," some filter-verb clustering ("she watched," "she needed," "she understood"), and occasional abstract descriptors ("otherworldly luminescence," "unfathomable patterns") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric resonance ("auroras painting her path in shifting colors of possibility"). However, template cadence appears in sequential "As she" constructions, and the phrase "vibrating sympathetically" repeats six times without sufficient variation. The closing paragraph contains synonym loops ("wonder" appears four times) that dilute impact.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant repetition issues: "quartz arbor" appears 7 times, "glass prism" 6 times without variation. Template phrasing pervades ("Elara stood," "Elara felt," "Elara knew"). The prose relies on abstract telling ("profound," "possibility," "uncertainty") over concrete imagery, particularly in supposedly pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several template patterns weaken momentum: "Elara touched...Elara knew...Elara gathered...Elara offered." The phrase "time's unraveling tapestry" appears twice nearly identically. Strong moments like "threads of undetectable sound unwinding from the world itself" demonstrate capability, but repetitive sentence openings and some overwriting ("stoically sparkling") create drag.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structures and clear spatial choreography. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "meek nature"/"meek in spirit," multiple iterations of determination, and redundant descriptions of Orion's transformation. The phrase "azure defiance" appears three times, creating unnecessary repetition despite its thematic importance.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence lengths and some evocative imagery ("shimmering possibilities that existed just beyond normal perception"). However, repetitive structures appear ("In alternate timelines..." "In other realities..." "In one surprising timeline...") and several abstract phrases lack specificity ("monumental and seemingly insignificant choices," "pushing the boundaries of human consciousness itself").

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("something larger than himself," "emotional shelter in a lineage") and some purple passages ("luminescent ache" used twice). Several sentences could be cut without loss ("The sea would have its secrets..."). Information density is moderate but momentum slows in the middle discovery section with excessive reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern or payoff. Multiple paraphrase loops appear ("guide them"/"guide them home," repeated descriptions of the lighthouse routine). The text corruption and density of abstract descriptors ("shadowed elation" used three times) impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose has moments of beauty ("tea house anchored to a single massive rock") but suffers from abstract loops around concepts like "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" without concrete embodiment. Template cadence appears in "he would rise...he would serve" constructions. Information density is moderate with some passages restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dense, overwrought prose clutters key moments: "profound understanding, calm and ancient as the oak itself" stacks modifiers without precision. Template cadence pervades ("Samuel believed," "Samuel methodically," "Samuel lowered"). The text loops conceptually, restating the trees' witness of sorrow across multiple paragraphs without advancing pressure. Information density suffers from exposition-heavy passages about dream cataloging.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing ("fractured glass," "condensed starlight," "visible light") creates distance from concrete action. Template repetition appears in "The keeper [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The prose achieves atmosphere but sacrifices propulsion through overreliance on conceptual language rather than specific, grounded detail.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstraction and template phrasing weaken line-level craft: "compassionate recluse," "finding solace," "extraordinary knowledge," "keenly empathetic nature." Multiple paraphrase loops restate the paradox concept without advancing pressure. The prose tells about tranquility rather than creating it through rhythm and image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("sacred in the ordinary" appears twice; "vanished bakery" recurs without variation) and filter-heavy construction in key beats. Lines like "Eliza understood that meaningful truths often hid in plain sight" tell what could be shown through action, though sensory details and rhythm variation prevent complete stagnation.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=5.4)
    Severe repetition problems: "orderly records chief" (4x), "gently meticulous" (3x), "sampling frequencies" (3x), "magic lantern slide" (5x), "while illusions faded to memory" (3x), "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" (3x). These template loops drain momentum. Prose clarity remains adequate but mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and atmospheric details like "slipping through her fingers like the damp sea air." Some expository passages ("This time, the seed took root") could trust more in dramatization, and occasional template phrases ("As expected," "But it wasn't enough") create minor momentum drags.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and strong sensory density. Information-rich sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously. Minor repetition of "terrestrially cosmic" and some abstract phrasing ("futuristic nostalgia of the moment") create slight drag.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("charcoal fingers" variants appear 7 times), template cadence in emotional transitions, and abstract declarations that replace concrete action. The final paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops restating the same "homecoming/rediscovery" concept without advancing meaning. Filter-verb stacks pervade high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some paraphrase loops appear ("lost conversations" concept restated multiple times). Template cadence emerges in discovery sequence ("Working methodically...Elara pieced together"). The "toxic sky glowed with uncertain light" closing image effectively recharges earlier atmospheric details.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract, elevated diction ("resonant harmony," "singular motivation," "feverish diligence") that creates distance rather than immediacy. The phrase "symphonies of truth" appears four times without deepening. Information density is low—multiple sentences restate the sculpture's function without advancing pressure. The final paragraph's "silent music of light" exemplifies the piece's tendency toward oxymoronic abstraction over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several repetitive constructions weaken momentum: "Unit 734" appears 11 times, "strangely organic" repeats verbatim. The "містул" typo and awkward constructions like "that.Unit 734's" show proofreading gaps. Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, though some paraphrase loops exist around the android's internal conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structures, though several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("Leo began to hear more through these casual conversations, realizing how deeply listening connected him" follows similar content). Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("healing began as families learned"). The opening efficiently establishes character and situation, but figurative language remains sparse and some pivotal moments rely on summary rather than scene ("When Leo opened the locked mailbox...he found").

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("mysterious familiarity" appears four times) and template constructions ("As a spider spins its web" used three times). Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly in the resolution where concepts are restated rather than advanced. Information density is moderate; many sentences serve single decorative purposes rather than advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is generally clean with evocative imagery, though some passages contain explanatory redundancy ("believing they weren't truly gone but stored somewhere in the fabric of reality" restates the core concept). The metaphorical language ("frozen light," "cosmic archives") enhances atmosphere without overwhelming. Some filter verb clusters in peak moments ("she could see images moving") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues plague the prose: "quiet brook" appears 6 times, "terrestrially cosmic" 5 times, "nocturnal haven" 4 times, creating a template-cadence effect. While individual sentences are grammatically clean, the paraphrase loops ("smoothed hush"/"mapping silence") and abstract language ("profound tranquility," "powerful yet controlled") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some template phrasing appears ("Clara recognized... immediately," "Clara understood," "Clara asked") but doesn't obscure closure; the final image of buildings as "old friends with stories" lands effectively despite earlier scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Elara stood," "Elara knew," "Elara's charmed skeptic nature") and abstract phrasing like "ghostly resolve" that lacks concrete embodiment. Template cadence appears in sequential "The [noun] [verb]" constructions, and several passages loop concepts without advancing pressure, particularly around the "charmed skeptic" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Elias had been...," "The aurora...," multiple "As [x]" constructions) and abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy. Template cadence appears in the final third ("The heritage rose thorn he would plant...," "As he walked away..."), and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("path to redemption"/"seeking to forgive").

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "while the universe hummed its secret song" (5x), "serpentine nexus under starlight" (4x), "whispering seashell half" (7x), "she was richly perceptive" (3x), "webs of intrigue" (4x). These template phrases create mechanical cadence rather than purposeful accumulation, and the prose lacks information density - many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=4.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "salvage something pure from the wreckage" appears verbatim twice, "windows of connection" repeats four times without evolution. Template phrasing pervades action sequences ("Elara descended," "Elara closed her eyes," "Elara knew," "Elara returned," "Elara smiled," "Elara placed"). The prose relies on abstract descriptors ("precious cargo and even more precious lives") rather than concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("He saw...," "His philosophy...," "The villagers...") and conceptual loops around "hidden patterns" without advancing pressure. Lines like "finding beauty in the ephemeral nature of all things" and "to notice the unnoticeable" read as abstract philosophy rather than embodied experience, though clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=4.8)
    Template cadence weakens momentum ("Maya traced...," "Maya felt...," "Maya refused...," "Maya touched..."), and abstract declarations replace concrete imagery in the final third. The phrase "sharply observant" appears four times without variation, creating repetitive stems that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=4.4)
    Significant overwriting issues include abstract declarations ("variant allegiance," "ancient shadows"), repetitive phrasing around the portico and frequencies, and summary-heavy construction that tells rather than dramatizes. Sentences often restate concepts without advancing pressure. The prose achieves atmospheric moments but suffers from density without precision.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with vivid moments like "dust motes dancing... tiny performers in the theater of his solitary existence." However, abstract phrases like "emotional resonance" and "service of others' stories" lean toward tell over show, and some paraphrase loops appear ("seeking beauty in discarded things" echoes the "wistful" attribute without adding pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive structures ("Elias [verb]" opens multiple sentences) and some overwriting ("blood-red horizon like a silent sentinel"). The phrase "logically emotional" appears twice without variation, and "forever changed" concludes with abstraction rather than image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=4.6)
    Repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "patient revolution" appears four times, variations of "moon paths" five times, and the concept of patience/impatience cycles through near-identical formulations. Sentences beginning with "The mapper" create template cadence across multiple paragraphs. While individual sentences achieve clarity, the accumulation of abstract assertions ("generations of rushing," "tyranny of urgency") without concrete dramatization creates a static, essay-like quality that resists narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose is functional with some evocative moments ("lantern seemed to reverberate with history"), but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Maya noticed," "Maya felt," "Maya's") and abstract emotional labeling ("fortified vulnerability," "watchfully calm"). Several paraphrase loops dilute momentum, particularly around the controlling influence theme.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong specific imagery ("counterfeit veins of copper wire," "vibrant hush"). Sentence variety creates appropriate rhythm, particularly in the atmospheric opening. Minor redundancies appear ("broke through storm clouds...filtering through") and some telling intrudes ("understanding dawning in her eyes"), but these don't touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive repetition undermines momentum: "yearning algorithm" appears 5 times, "steadily curious" 3 times verbatim. Template cadence dominates ("The glider [verb]..." structure in 8+ sentences). The prose lacks density - many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive overwriting with mixed metaphors ("silent scream," "digital fingerprint haunting"), template cadence in long compound sentences, and abstract phrasing that tells rather than shows ("feeling the static electricity of forbidden knowledge"). The final paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops about truth and deletion that dilute impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("branches catching the moonlight in diamond-like facets") but suffers from repetitive phrasing: "weighted breath before reply" appears twice, "mapping empathy onto action" twice, "courageously anomalous" variations. These loops and the occasionally overwrought metaphors ("ink in water") diminish momentum despite strong individual images.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrases ("windborne solace" appears 4 times, "drift-ice marina" 5 times, "heirloom lace parasol tip" 6 times) creating template cadence. Lines 23-25 contain paraphrase loops about transformation/becoming. Register drift into elevated philosophical diction ("fold in patience needed for this work," "transformation—a becoming") disrupts momentum. Information density is low with multiple lines restating Elena's realization about endings/beginnings without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.8)
    Severe paraphrase loops plague the text: "drawing parallels" appears 5 times, "gentle persuasion/gently persuasive" 4 times, "amber pavilion" 6 times, creating synonym churn without advancement. Template cadence runs through "He fingered," "He pulled," "He remembered" without variation. Information density is extremely low—removing entire paragraphs wouldn't change knowledge or situation. The text reads as elaborate scaffolding around a thin concept.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from abstract density without concrete anchoring—phrases like "conjured clearings between realities" and "echo of wisdom flowing through them" accumulate without advancing specific action. Template cadence appears in repetitive structures ("The line walker [verb]ed"). Multiple paraphrase loops restate the preservation mission without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Elara" appears 17 times) and abstract telling ("something magical began to happen"). Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same healing concept without advancement. Information density is low - many sentences could be cut without losing story knowledge. Filter constructions like "she believed" and "seemed to" dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition loops dominate: "weathered innocence" (4x), "suspended hush" (4x), "fractured sequences" (5x), "pattern of growth" (4x), creating template cadence rather than purposeful accumulation. The phrase "testify through fractured sequences" appears nearly verbatim three times. These loops obscure rather than enhance the accumulative design, and the filter-heavy construction ("he had discovered," "he understood") dulls immediacy throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and selective detail, though some figurative language borders on overwrought ("ships in a misty harbor"). The filter-verb cluster around memories ("He remembered back to") and slight redundancy in the ending (turning to arrange markers again) prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves clarity but suffers from repetitive "luminous ache" (4 instances), some filter-verb clustering ("she noticed," "she remembered"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language. The paraphrase loop about perception/observation in the final paragraph dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence lengths and purposeful repetition of "pulsing stillness." However, abstract phrases accumulate: "fragments of love, memory, and music," "bridge between understanding and acceptance," "ordinary magic." The phrase "hymning the mundane" appears twice without evolution. Some filter verbs ("I understand now") could be cut for immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant repetition issues: "budding rune scholar" (4x), "clockwork automaton key" (5x), "by closing loops" (3x) create mechanical cadence. Template phrases proliferate: "heart raced," "steady hands," "filled with blinding light." The prose achieves basic clarity but lacks density—multiple sentences restate rather than advance ("The method would require patience" followed by explanation of the same concept).

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates control with varied sentence structures and specific imagery like "moonpetals that had just begun to open in the garden's perpetual twilight." Information density is generally strong. However, several passages contain unnecessary scaffolding ("Eleanor had always been," "The discovery...had created"), and the phrase "turning mistakes into constellations" appears three times, creating a paraphrase loop that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves clarity but suffers from repetitive sentence openings ("She began," "She discovered," "Her work") and template cadence in multiple paragraphs. The paraphrase loop around memories resurfacing (lines 4 and 22) adds no new pressure. Information density is moderate - most sentences do single duty rather than layering meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "moss nourishing itself on corroded elements" and effective rhythm variation. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("finding solace"/"could finally breathe"; "watchful dreamer" explained twice). Some sentences strain for profundity ("conversation between grandmother's ghost and her own future"). The extended metaphor system mostly coheres but occasionally overreaches.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from systematic repetition and scaffold structures: "lucidly watchful" repeats three times, "swirling hush" twice, "ephemeral cameo appearances" three times without variation or development. Figurative density overwhelms without purpose—nearly every sentence contains metaphorical language that obscures rather than clarifies. Template cadence pervades: "He had [verb]," "The [subject] [verb]," creating monotonous rhythm. Information density remains low as multiple paragraphs restate the same artistic struggle without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose clarity suffers from repetitive phrasing ("verdant arbor" appears 4 times, "harvest moon" 6 times without variation). Several passages loop conceptually: "The remedy was working—through the forgotten songs, the connection between people and place was healing" restates rather than advances. Template fantasy diction ("ancient trees," "soft luminescence," "profound silence") reduces specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=5.2)
    Repetitive structures pervade: "The alchemist's hands... moved," "The process was delicate," "The world seemed to hold." Abstract inflation weakens precision—"transcended their humble origins," "ripple across the ages." The prose tells about significance rather than generating it through concrete detail and varied rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves moments of elegance ("the wound in summer, that strange lull when the season hesitated") but suffers from paraphrase loops—the concept of harvesting echoes is restated multiple times without advancement. Several template constructions appear ("Day by day," "Days turned to weeks"). Information density is uneven, with some paragraphs merely elaborating established concepts rather than advancing story.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose achieves moments of lyrical precision ("shingled hush deepened") but suffers from repetitive structures and conceptual loops. "Orienting properly" appears four times with minimal variation; "boundary-lessly trapped" three times; "calcified" becomes overused. The phrase "whalebone reverie" appears twice identically. Information density remains moderate—many sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle burden sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. However, multiple paraphrase loops damage momentum: "here and gone"/"here and gone simultaneously," "crystallized time"/"crystallized moments"/"crystallized pocket," and the kettle's progress described redundantly. The Chinese character typo and some overwriting in figurative language ("each droplet a tiny prism") further reduce the score.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting appears ("magnificent carousel," "mesmerizing patterns") and occasional template phrasing ("what felt like both an instant and an eternity"). Information density is good with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.1)
    Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("maze of intentions" appears three times, "functionally creative" twice) without concrete dramatization. Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" constructions, and the phrase "equation for hope" substitutes for actual specificity about Maya's discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Repetitive phrasing undermines momentum: "excruciatingly gentle" appears three times, "soundless sanctuary" four times, "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" three times verbatim. The prose achieves some lovely moments ("like the glacial hush of faraway ice fields") but template repetition and abstract declarations ("filled with the resonance of possibility") dilute impact.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=4.4)
    Prose suffers from extensive paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy—"architecture of lies" appears three times, multiple sentences restate the truth/deception theme without advancement. Abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval," "hindsight clarity") replaces concrete imagery. Template cadence runs appear: "She had come...She had inherited...She sought..." Filter verbs and telling dominate over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with atmospheric rhythm matching the oceanic hush. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Minor repetition in "The seed collector" openings and some filter constructions ("he noticed," "he felt") create slight drag without breaking momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments of specificity ("crimson weft shimmered in the fading light") and varies sentence structure effectively. However, several paraphrase loops appear (lines about projection of presence repeat similar content), and abstract phrases like "geography of healing" and "lonesome splendor" lean toward purple prose. The template pattern of "He [verb]" appears in multiple consecutive sentences mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structures and clear progression. Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "hypothesizing about everything"/"hypothesized about the bird"/"hypothesizing about what this discovery meant." Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("bitter sweetness"/"bitter taste of failure"). The transformation sequence achieves good sensory specificity, but abstract descriptors ("cold, calculating realm") and filter constructions dilute immediacy elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues undermine momentum: "gracefully alert" appears verbatim three times, "scars can sing" four times, "migration of clouds" five times. Template cadence runs appear in descriptive passages ("She touched... She collected... She added..."). The prose achieves clarity but lacks density—many sentences restate rather than advance. Opening and closing lines do create bookends, but intervening sections suffer from paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structures, but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("defiant hush" appears three times, "luminous skeptic/skepticism" variants four times). Several passages lean purple ("shadows around her," "strange stillness when the world itself seemed to hold its breath") without earning the elevation through specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues undermine momentum: "approximating infinity" appears 6 times, "quiet sigh of falling petals" 6 times, "share light without using fire" 5 times. While potentially pattern-teaching, these loops don't accumulate new meaning or pressure. Template cadence pervades: "The [subject] [verb]" dominates sentence openings.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose maintains clarity but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts ("spectral mentor" appears 6 times, "woven ribbon" 5 times without variation). Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("Elias pressed...Elias prepared...Elias closed his eyes...Elias decided"). The typo "Thecompleted" and awkward phrasing "drawn by rumors of its power to absorb not mourn" indicate proofreading gaps that touch important beats.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=4.4)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing ("incremental absolution," "delicate calibration," "imperfect harmony") creates distance from concrete experience. Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same community-vs-isolation theme. Template progression and philosophical abstractions ("wisdom often emerges through what appears broken") replace specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, but occasional overwriting ("velveteen gloom" appears three times) and some template phrasing ("Elias knew," "Elias realized"). The line "love, in all its forms, was the most persistent echo of all" veers toward sentiment over earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=4.4)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy pervade the text—"ignorance cartographer," "charting...what was yet to be discovered," "write the future through predictive modeling" all restate the same concept. Template cadence appears in "Elara stood...Elara practiced...Elara dipped...Elara took...Elara smiled...Elara knew" creating mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition loops pervade the text: the story famine context is explained three times, her discovery of dust's properties twice, her broadcast method multiple times. Template cadence ("She had been... She began... She packed...") dominates transitions. The paraphrase loops and redundant exposition significantly harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe repetition issues: "vanishing point gallery" (4x), "mirage of safety" (3x), "weaving/weaved truth carefully" (2x), "ash scatter" variants (3x), "porcelain mask" (multiple). Template cadence in "Elena [verb]" constructions. Abstract phrasing ("somber marvel," "beautiful pain") replaces specific imagery in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=3.4)
    Severe repetition problems: "sedimentary layers" appears 6 times, "competing narratives" 4 times, "abrasive calm" 3 times, "wannabe philosopher" 3 times. Template cadence dominates with "Milo [verb]" constructions. These loops and redundancies significantly harm momentum and suggest algorithmic generation rather than crafted prose.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=4.4)
    Extensive paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "Eleanor sat...Eleanor believed...Eleanor's joy came from." Multiple paragraphs restate the same concepts about harmony and diversity without adding pressure. Filter-verb stacks ("she explained," "she told," "she reminded") distance us from immediacy, particularly in what should be peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.2)
    Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "gentle rebellion" concept restated four times; "create something beautiful from ruins" appears twice verbatim. Template cadence in "Elias could..." constructions. Abstract declarations ("revolution started with seeds") replace concrete imagery. The phrase "synaptic plasticity" appears twice, creating technical jargon repetition that breaks voice.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose remains generally clear with varied sentence structures, though several paraphrase loops appear ("preserve wonder in routine" repeated twice verbatim, similar phrasing around the blackout cause). The opening establishes atmosphere effectively, but momentum stalls during expository dialogue exchanges, and some metaphorical language ("nectar dusk," "gilded") feels ornamental rather than pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "houses breathed with life while others merely occupied space" restated as "some spaces breathed while others only existed." Template phrases like "inadvertently profound" and "hushed blaze" feel forced rather than organic. The final paragraph's explicit theme statement and repetitive "quiet bay in spring" undermine line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant repetition issues: "telepathic/telepathically" appears 8 times, "statue" 14 times, creating template cadence. Phrases like "the statue communicated," "the statue explained," "the statue continued" form repetitive stems. The prose achieves moments of beauty but suffers from paraphrase loops, particularly around the certainty/nuance theme being restated rather than developed through action.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.4)
    Severe repetition issues: "grim optimism" appears 5 times, "perpetual motion" 4 times, "balancedly daring" 3 times as forced insertions. Template phrasing pervades: "Elias [verb]" sentence openings, abstract declarations ("boundless confinement had become his reality"). The prose tells emotional states rather than embodying them through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing around "lost languages," "forgotten," and "connection across time." Multiple paragraphs restate the same concept about kindness transcending time without adding pressure. "The insomniac painter" appears twice as an identical opener, and abstract declarations replace concrete imagery in several beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("rosewater dread of a culture slowly eroding") but suffers from density issues in places. Some metaphor mixing ("swallowing the cavernous expanse"). The "决心" character insertion appears to be a technical error. Information density is generally good with purposeful description.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts ("latent radiance" appears 5 times, "counter clockwise" 4 times). Some sentences feel scaffolded, particularly the repeated structure of "She/Her [verb]" openings. The final third improves in momentum but earlier sections drag with exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("sickly, beautiful light") but suffers from abstract philosophizing that slows momentum ("transformation itself, beautiful precisely because it terrifies us into growth"). Some template phrasing appears ("I reached out," "I turned," "I obeyed") without sufficient variation. The paradox readings provide rhythm but edge toward repetitive structure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "obstacles into instruments" (appears 4 times) and abstract descriptions that don't advance pressure. Template cadence appears in "She...She...The prophet..." sequences. Information density is low with multiple paragraphs restating the same philosophical point.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several template constructions appear ("Each morning, he would rise," "Today, however, felt different"). Information density is adequate but could be tighter - some passages restate rather than advance ("The city bustled around him...but Kael remained focused").

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.4)
    Persistent overwriting issues include abstract language ("emotionally rational approach" appears twice), redundant phrasing ("deliberately obscured"/"intentional distortion"), and exposition-heavy passages that tell rather than show. Multiple sentences beginning with "The" or "Eleanor" create monotonous rhythm. The prose lacks the precision and momentum required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.3)
    While generally clean, the prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("antique traveling inkwell" appears four times nearly identically) and some overwriting ("sacred space of loss and beauty"). The rhythm varies appropriately but includes template constructions ("Tomorrow, he would..." repeated three times) that weaken the ending's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstraction loops ("tranquilly perceptive" appears four times without variation) and overreliance on telling ("His logical mind appreciated," "Hours passed"). Multiple template constructions ("Elias + verb" openings dominate) create monotonous rhythm, while figurative language like "dappled sunlight through water" feels decorative rather than essential to meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose achieves moments of lyric beauty but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts - "after the shadow detached" appears three times, "luminous torment" twice, creating loops that dull impact. Several sentences restate rather than advance ("His craftiness lay in his ability to find beauty even in pain, to create light from darkness" followed immediately by near-paraphrase about the cranes).

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=4.9)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum: "intangibly tangible" appears twice, "bleak exhilaration" twice, "unused potential pools" becomes "where unused potential pools," and multiple sentences begin with "Elias" or "He." The abstract descriptors ("colors that shouldn't exist," "liquid light") substitute for concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract inflation: "cosmic alignment," "forgotten truths," "harmonic frequencies" accumulate without concrete grounding. Template phrasing appears: "fingers flew across," "racing heart," "deep breath." The phrase "brilliant dimness that defied all logical explanation" exemplifies overwriting that tells paradox rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Martin + verb" construction dominates) and abstract metaphors that blur clarity ("sieved hush," "temple of trade"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly around Martin's profession being explained multiple times. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing particularly damages line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstraction loops ("neutral territory isn't just about geography" followed by explanation) and template phrasing ("shoulders relaxed for the first time"). Multiple instances of telling over showing: "uncommonly thoughtful nature telling her" and "understanding that this prisoner exchange was about more than just bodies." The metaphorical language feels strained ("untether from the past").

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose flows adequately but contains repetitive phrasing around regret/failure concepts and some scaffolding ("Days like this," "Now, as she"). The metaphor "anchor and albatross" works but several abstract summaries ("merrily melancholic state," "heavy cloak of her regrets") reduce immediacy. Information density is moderate with some redundancy between paragraphs three and four.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive stems ("I touched," "I ran my thumb," "I took"), abstract descriptors ("tangible yet elusive"), and paraphrase loops (multiple restatements about reading between lines). The metaphor "pressed down like water in my chest" contradicts itself. Information density is low with much philosophical musing that doesn't advance plot.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm during the ritual sequence. Information density is good - most lines advance either transformation or emotional stakes. Some redundancy appears ("not quite solid, not quite ghost" followed immediately by "echo of her brother"), and occasional overwriting ("cosmic moment...cosmic intimacy").

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades the text: "choking beauty" appears 5 times, "willingly perplexed" 4 times, "midnight glade above clouds" 3 times, creating synonym loops rather than development. Template cadence dominates with "She [verb]" or "The cartomancer [verb]" opening most paragraphs, and abstract descriptors ("ethereal beauty," "sacred place") replace concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from density issues with figurative language in nearly every sentence ("spectral ghost," "haunting silence," "luminous understanding"). Template cadence appears in the stitching sequence with repetitive "Eli [verb]" constructions. Information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("vibrant hush" appears 5 times, "slow dance of celestial bodies" 3 times) and abstract terminology that dulls immediacy ("texture of transformation"). Several passages contain paraphrase loops, particularly around Ian's understanding of transformation, though the writing avoids major grammatical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose demonstrates solid clarity with purposeful repetition of "bronze quill holder" and "vigilant lock sentinel" creating rhythm. The Chinese character "联络" (meaning "contact/liaison") appears to be an artifact that breaks the English text flow. Some phrases like "winking hush" feel forced, and occasional overwriting ("wan glow," "tangible reminder") slightly dampens momentum, though information density remains adequate.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves clarity and momentum in action sequences, particularly during stone placement, but suffers from repetitive sentence structures ("She had been," "She had made," "She finally understood") and some overwriting in descriptive passages. Information density is moderate, with several sentences that could do multiple jobs but settle for single purposes.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with good syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "crystalline verses," "relentless campaign," and abstract constructions like "the power of truth, like lightning, could not be contained forever." Some paraphrase loops occur ("censored poet"/"silenced heart," multiple variations on suppression). Information density is moderate but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Aris [verb]," "He [verb]") and abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy. Multiple instances of telling over showing ("his voice warm despite his formidable reputation"). The phrase "dignified chaos" appears three times, creating unnecessary loop.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("moon cleared the skyline," "dandelions through concrete") with varied sentence structures. However, multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "blooming resistance" appears four times with minimal variation; "luminous fracture" repeats three times; lines about rebuilding and resistance restate similar content. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("Yesterday he'd been...today he was...").

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery ("fingers danced across ivory keys"). Information density is generally high, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("wistful," "melancholy yet hopeful strains"). The ancient texts exposition and film mechanics explanation create minor momentum drag but don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong rhythm variation and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. However, several template constructions appear: "seemed to" occurs 5 times, creating filter-verb accumulation; "Elara [verb]" opens multiple sequential sentences in places. The opening and closing sentences effectively frame the journey, but middle sections contain mild redundancy ("ancient" appears 7 times).

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and some strong images ("needle trembling with otherworldly energy"). Yet figurative density overwhelms in places ("tides of remembrance," "cerulean regret," "transcendent beauty"), and abstract descriptors replace concrete detail, particularly in emotional moments.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with high information density. A minor deduction for repetitive use of the "accumulated dust patterns" phrase and a slight template cadence in the final paragraph ("The decay...", "And as she...") which slightly dulls the closure's impact without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is generally excellent, with high information density and purposeful, vivid description. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. A minor instance of potential "telling" in stating her motivation shift ("Lena's motivation had shifted...") holds it just below the 9.0 band, as it summarizes a internal state that could be more fully embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally lucid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor loop exists with the repetition of "unshaken marvels," which slightly dulls the pattern's impact but does not obscure closure. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful (e.g., "dance like visible sound waves"). Rhythm varies effectively, particularly in the closing paragraphs, sustaining momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A few minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight synonym churn ("chased stillness" repeated) and a template cadence in one beat ("He rented... He descended..."). These do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clear and concise with good momentum and rhythmic control. However, a minor prose artifact exists: a near-paraphrase loop occurs between "hope had not" and "renewed purpose," slightly reducing information density without advancing pressure. This does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is highly polished with excellent rhythmic control and information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("The air breathed with foggy lucidity"). There are no observable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, even in the peak beat of the revelation. The closure image is rendered with clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied, purposeful syntax. Figurative language ("pulse with a life of its own," "disintegrate like ash") is coherent and enhances clarity. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected that obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid, concise, and propulsive. The description of the arrow's "iridescent colors that seemed to shift in the light" is a moment of slightly ornate description that, while beautiful, slightly slows the high-pressure beat of discovery. Otherwise, line-level craft is strong and serves the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that, while beautiful, can create minor momentum drag. The closure beat remains crystal clear and powerful, saving the score from a larger deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density, often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "fleeting golden sunset" establishes time, mood, and stakes). Sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating with the action. A single, minor artifact is the word "捕捉" which appears to be a non-English insertion (perhaps a typo for "captured") and creates a slight coherence break in an otherwise flawless line. This minor issue does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance story and atmosphere. However, minor overwriting appears in a high-pressure beat with clustered figurative language ("like a period at the end of winter's long sentence"), applying a small deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density ("crouched between rusted shelves... cradled the whispering seashell"). No loops or artifacts; rhythm varies naturally with pressure. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("voice like distant waves").

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally to support the scene's needs. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward synonymous phrasing (e.g., "profound silence," "ambered hush," "marbled hush") in adjacent lines, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("frozen vibrations," "harmonious synthesis") is precise, purposeful, and never muddles clarity. Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic control are masterful, accelerating the narrative toward its profound closure.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("the raindrops on the crystal structures creating a soft melody"). Rhythm varies naturally, and there are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud quality is excellent, with clean grammar and punctuation.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythm and variation. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("blooming withering") slightly obscures clarity but does not harm closure. No significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally precise and propulsive, with high information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "icy warmth" is repeated several times, creating a slight synonym-loop effect. However, this does not significantly obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exceptional with high information density and vivid imagery. A minor prose artifact exists: the phrase "wordless conversation" is used twice, creating a slight paraphrase loop. However, this does not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the powerful closure image, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and variation. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. A minor artifact penalty (-0.2) for a template cadence in the description of the station's equipment ("radio equipment, barometers, and spectrograph arrays formed a half-circle...").

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("weight of a swallowed truth," "drowsy alertness"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift obscure the closure. The final paragraph's cadence shift effectively releases the accumulated tension into clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally dense, vivid, and propulsive. A minor instance of overwriting occurs in the high-pressure beat describing the silence ("active, presence-filled void"); the stacked modifiers slightly blur clarity. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional, with varied syntax and a strong read-aloud rhythm that supports the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines often doing multiple jobs (e.g., the locket description carrying character and theme). A minor register drift occurs in "cautious exuberance," which feels slightly academic for peak stress, but it is an isolated moment and does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and evocative, with high information density and a strong, varied rhythm that supports the atmospheric tone. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats ("silence had taken on a bronze quality"), though it largely remains coherent and purposeful rather than muddying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally polished and purposeful with high information density. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward slightly elevated diction ("palimpsest of destinies") and a paraphrase loop near the end concerning "open secrets," but these do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor issues include a slight register drift in phrases like "sonic architecture" and "unraveled stillness," which feel academic for peak pressure, and a paraphrase loop near the end ("profound truths require not volume but the space created by silence").

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some high-pressure beats (e.g., "exhaustion creeping... like a tide") and a near-paraphrase loop between "unheard symphonies" and "music that existed beyond sound." However, these do not obscure closure, and the final paragraph's propulsion is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor artifact exists: a run of sentences with similar "The [subject] [verbed]" structure in the second paragraph, creating a slight template cadence. This does not obscure closure but prevents a top-score.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("filament of hush"). Minor scaffold appears in the "Each day" paragraph with repetitive sentence openings. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated. No artifacts harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally precise and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight pattern of repetitive phrasing ("nurture integrity in solitude," "progressing laterally") and a few instances of near-synonym churn ("quiet courtyard," "tranquility," "peace").

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly concise and vivid, with strong information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance character and atmosphere without scaffolding or loops. A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the final paragraphs ("testament to love that transcended absence"), though it remains largely voice-consistent and does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with high information density. A minor tendency towards slightly overwrought phrasing ("passionate subtlety") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("The pattern complete... the poet sat back and simply observed") slightly dulls the closure's impact, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished with strong rhythm and clarity. Figurative language ("tapestry of sound") serves the theme without muddle. No loops or artifacts. Minor deduction for near-redundancy in "acoustically perceptive nature" and "acutely perceptive ears," though it reinforces character.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear, concise, and highly effective, with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. A minor instance of potential "therapy-speak" ("affectionate detachment") appears near the end, but it is brief and does not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is polished, concise, and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structures. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The final paragraph's lyrical cadence is effective and earned. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent, with a clear acceleration and deceleration matching the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. A single artifact ("沟通推进") creates a minor register blip. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with high information density and no loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is effective and coherent (e.g., "dissonant patterns," "crystal-like patterns"). No significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacting. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on visual description at the expense of other senses in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact occurs in the peak beat: "her buried optimism surged within her, though she kept it carefully contained" has a slight paraphrase-loop quality. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent, advancing story and character without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and precise, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for a template cadence from repeated phrases ("sapphire hush," "kindly methodical") and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats, though clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story and character efficiently, such as the pivotal line: "Instead of deploying her usual protective measures, she opened the greenhouse vents..." Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language ("insect-prisoned center") is effective and consistent. A minor instance of potential label-speak ("transforming trauma into testimony") is brief and feels earned by the context, not harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts were detected. The final paragraph's cadence shift effectively supports the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of template cadence in the description of her visions ("each one another piece... each revelation arriving...") which prevents a perfect score, but it does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, clusters of filter verbs ("Ethan experienced the hour", "he felt the ground shift", "he felt as though") in the inciting incident and climax create minor momentum drag and abstraction in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propelled by a rhythmic cadence suited to the meditative, accumulative mode. Minor artifacts include a slight thesaurus-churn feel in phrases like "resonant harmonies" and "entangled memories," and a repetitive stem ("Through forgotten patterns...") used twice. These do not significantly obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally polished and purposeful, with high information density. Minor issues include a occasional predictable cadence ("The hushed thunder...") and a slight over-reliance on compound sentences in high-pressure beats, creating a minor drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story and character effectively. There is a minor artifact: the phrase "deathly vitality" feels slightly contrived and risks being a mixed metaphor, though it is thematically motivated. The rhythm is strong and supports the narrative's tension.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("unfurling like scrolls") is purposeful and taught. Momentum is maintained through selective detail, and closure image is clear and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush and highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor momentum drag occurs in the middle with a cluster of reflective sentences, creating a slight scaffold effect. However, the language remains precise and purposeful, and the closure beat is clean and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, but minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "gloomy cheerfulness" feels slightly contrived). No loops or scaffold issues, and figurative language coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong sensory detail. There is a minor instance of paraphrasing: "navigating corporate takeover" and later "navigate gentrification without losing its soul." The phrase "orderly intuitive network of visual communication" is slightly clunky and feels like a label. However, these are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure or causality. The final paragraphs are particularly strong and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with varied sentence structures. However, slight repetitive phrasing ("dawning hush," "dawnlit melancholy") creates minor texture loops. Figurative language is cohesive and supports tone. Information density is high, with lines advancing both plot and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density—e.g., "internal circuits exposed like vulnerable nerves" serves character, setting, and stakes. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the ship's departure. Diction is specific and consistent with Elias's expertise.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and purposeful, with strong information density. A minor issue is a cluster of figurative language in the high-pressure beat describing the convergence ("mathematics of flow, the physics of hydraulics, and the poetry of creation"), which slightly risks decorative stacking but remains coherent and thematically justified. Sentence-level rhythm and syntax are expertly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and propel the narrative forward. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The opening and closing lines are perfectly anchored, and the read-aloud rhythm is flawless, sustaining the "wild hush" tone throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "captured stars," "descending angels") and a near-paraphrase loop between "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor," but these do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. There is a minor instance of potential synonym churn ("chasing hush, a silence") in the second paragraph, but it does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure. The final paragraphs achieve powerful propulsion and clarity, landing the closure image with zero figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and varied sentence structure that supports the story's dreamlike momentum. Information density is high, with most lines doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. A few near-redundant phrases ("ephemeral cameo appearances," "resonant awakenings") create minor echo effects, but they do not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "mist curled like sleeping serpents") but is pattern-taught and pays off, serving the accumulative design without obscuring closure. No significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Figurative language ("like water finding its way back to a forgotten spring") serves character and theme. No loops or scaffold artifacts. One minor paraphrase: "renewal of purpose and connection" slightly restates prior ideas but does not harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor filter-verb stack ("Elara crouched down, pulling..."; "Elara rose and dusted...") in a contiguous beat creates a slight template cadence, preventing a flawless score. No figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, precise imagery. Information density is high, with sentences serving multiple purposes (e.g., "the eternal candle's flame flickered... casting elongated shadows that became her secret accomplices"). A minor deduction for a slightly mixed metaphor ("prismatic tears") and a moment of near-scaffold ("echoed silence would eventually replace the whispers").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with sentences that advance multiple jobs of character, atmosphere, and plot. Rhythm is expertly controlled, accelerating with the spirits' crescendo and breathing in moments of revelation. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "fierce tenderness" is repeated three times, creating a slight template cadence. However, this does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image, which remains crystal clear.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished and dense with purpose, though a tendency toward complex syntax and figurative language ("lotus-hearted ache") creates minor momentum drag in a few high-pressure beats. However, every sentence advances character or atmosphere, and there are no loops or scaffolding artifacts. The final paragraph's rhythm is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potential scaffold exists in "a pensive mirth lifting her spirits," which leans slightly abstract. However, this is isolated and does not harm closure clarity or cause momentum drag. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally lucid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. However, a tendency toward figurative density in high-pressure beats ("nested revelations," "nested dimensions") creates minor opacity. A template cadence is faintly detectable in the repetition of "the pause between question and reply," though it serves a patterned purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A very minor artifact exists in the slightly repetitive use of "converging chaos," but this is a small flaw that does not measurably harm propulsion or closure clarity. The read-aloud test is passed with flying colors.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control, though it occasionally flirts with overwriting (e.g., "reef-shadow joy" risks abstraction). However, the density serves the accumulative mode and never obscures causality or the closure image. No loops or scaffolding artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and minimal scaffolding. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "foxglove regret" risks feeling like a diagnostic label, though it is quickly embodied. This slight strain in a peak beat prevents a higher score, but clarity and momentum are never sacrificed.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include the repetitive use of the phrase "symphonies of truth" and "interconnected promises," which, while thematic, create a slight template cadence. The figurative language is mostly coherent and supports the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. Sentence-level rhythm effectively supports scene needs. A minor deduction for a few instances of slightly ornate phrasing (e.g., "dappled resolve") that, while voice-motivated, border on decorative and slightly slow the momentum in their immediate beats.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor scaffold is present in adjacent sentences restating the same idea (e.g., "reinvention... wasn't as tidy" followed by "fragments emerged like stubborn dust motes"), triggering a small deduction. However, information density is high, and the closure image is clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with minimal scaffolding. Minor figurative overload in "air thickening like water" slightly muddles peak beat, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with high information density. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. Minor artifacts include some synonym churn ("shadowseam wonder," "luminous respite") and a few complex metaphors that require parsing, preventing a higher score despite the strong overall execution.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifact deduction for a template cadence run in the final paragraphs ("The recollectionist settled... These were not... Before memory fades...") and a slight synonym churn around "understanding/realization." These do not obscure closure but create minor rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for mild figurative density in the closure paragraph ("conspirators in his wilderness of carefully planned spontaneity") which, while purposeful, slightly softens the final image's impact. Otherwise, sentence-level craft is strong, with varied rhythm and a lack of loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, figurative language is extremely dense, appearing in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats (e.g., "roots of energy," "threads of luminous ink"). This creates a slight muddle and reduces propulsion, preventing a higher score despite otherwise exemplary craft.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in peak beats, such as the cluster of complex metaphors in the description of the prism atrium, which creates a momentary density spike that slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lucid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("a dark vein against the milky porcelain"). Zero loops, scaffold, or artifacting. The closure beat is crystal clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. However, minor artifacts appear, including a template cadence in "logical dreamer" and "lucidly watchful," and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats that occasionally blurs sense without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is clean, concise, and possesses a varied, purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles are present. The final paragraph lands with potent resonance without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. A slight tendency toward decorative phrasing ("perceptively calm demeanor") appears but doesn't obscure closure. The final paragraph's "dusky harmony" and "melancholy of separation" land with clear cost and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely elegant and purposeful. A minor deduction for figurative density and a register drift in the final paragraphs ("flawed, painful, beautiful complexity," "ethereal glow"), which slightly softens the impact of the powerful, simpler concluding lines. The closure beat remains clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose demonstrates high information density and rhythmic control, though minor metaphorical strain occurs in "fractured grace" which slightly muddles the established pattern. Otherwise clean propulsion with purposeful sentence variation. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats, creating a mild density issue that slightly obscures immediacy without harming closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm, but some overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "meteor hush of anticipation"). A template cadence emerges with the repeated "half-lit epiphany," triggering a minor deduction. Figurative language is sometimes overused, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor artifact: a slight template cadence emerges in a run of sentences starting with "The" in the first paragraph, but this does not harm closure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for the slightly ornamental phrase "snowmelt ardor," which, while evocative, risks feeling like a thesaurus churn in a peak beat. Otherwise, the language is precise, concrete, and devoid of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density. Minor scaffold exists in the twice-repeated "precisely playful," creating a slight template cadence. Figurative language ("like sugar in water") is effective and clear. Rhythm and syntax modulate well with the storm's build and the dream's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor instances of slightly elevated diction ("dusky harmony") feel voice-motivated rather than jarring. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle to obscure the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with high information density. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs with "cylinder pin broken, unable to produce the melodies" – a pin break typically stops a box from playing, but doesn't destroy the melodies themselves. This is a small but noticeable coherence slip in a key image.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and controlled, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("luminous butterfly of starlight") slightly obscures clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propelled with strong rhythm and variety. There is high information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) for a template cadence in the sentence: "She pulled out a small tin first, filled with... Then her fingers brushed against something softer..." which creates a slight mechanical feel.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, often doing multiple jobs. Rhythm is controlled and purposeful. Some overwriting is present ("simply complicated nature" appears twice, "profound philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms" is repeated), creating minor scaffold that slightly dulls momentum but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is elegant and highly controlled with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a repetitive use of "unheard symphony" and a slightly over-written description of the guardians ("a garden of ink and paper in an unheard symphony of motion and meaning") that creates a small loop, slightly dulling clarity in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple purposes. A minor deduction for a few instances of slightly abstract or summary phrasing in peak beats (e.g., "blissfully aberrant," "endless narrative threads") which very slightly dull the immediacy of the closure image. Otherwise, clear of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. However, a minor artifact occurs in the high-pressure beat describing the rope: "centuries-old ceremonial rope" is slightly redundant. The rhythm is otherwise excellent, and the closure image is sharp and undulled by line-level issues.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is concise and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "bloom of hush" is pattern-taught and pays off, though minor redundancy in "gentle luminosity" appears twice without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Minor artifacts include a slight paraphrase loop ("coincidences had meaning" / "coincidences were not random at all") and the phrase "thistle-blown hope" risks register drift, though it is voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: the phrase "preemptively nostalgic" is a near-label that slightly dulls immediacy. However, information density is high, and figurative language is generally purposeful and coherent, supporting the accumulative drive without muddying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) is applied for a cluster of stacked modifiers in the climax ("purple that sang, green that whispered, gold that danced") which, while beautiful, slightly muddles the sensory clarity at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, with high information density. However, a minor text artifact occurs with the repetitive use of "tangential approach" (used three times), which creates a slight template cadence. This does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score. Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic control are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control that propels the narrative. The prose is largely free of scaffolds and loops. The single artifact noted in Q6 ("stretching contracted") prevents a higher score, as it represents a minor figurative muddle in a key descriptive beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propelled by vivid, purposeful imagery. Sentence-level rhythm varies effectively to match the serene atmosphere. A minor flaw is the slightly repetitive use of "fluidly logical" and "vaulting hush," which, while thematic, creates a faint template cadence that prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong, vivid, and purposeful. However, it occasionally leans into dense, figurative language that can slightly impede momentum (e.g., "digital trees whispered nostalgia in binary code"). A few instances of synonym-like phrasing ("ancient energy," "profound connection") prevent a top-tier score, though clarity is never broken.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for figurative density in the high-pressure beat describing the reciprocal scars and new threshold, which momentarily slows momentum with slightly elevated diction at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. However, minor artifacts appear, including the slightly muddled metaphor "shadowseam wonder" and a template cadence in "The pyramid scheme survivor became the guardian of a miracle." These do not severely harm clarity but prevent a higher score. Sentence-level rhythm is effective, and the final line successfully resolves and recharges the core motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a pattern of repetitive sentence stems and some synonymous phrasing ("ancient tomes and forgotten histories") creates minor scaffold. This does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and purposeful, vivid imagery. Rhythm is controlled and propulsive. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight register drift in the climax ("shivering bliss") and a subtle paraphrase loop describing the program's nature ("metaphysical guides"/"key to speaking with forces"). These are minor and do not touch the closure, but indicate a hairline lack of total control under maximum pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is clear and concise with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., the button's description also establishes its mystery). A few filter verbs ("she wondered," "she felt") create minor scaffolding. One near-paraphrase loop ("unfurl the mystery" / "unfurled not just one man's history") is present but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A few artifacts appear, including a mixed metaphor ("painted the sky in bruised purples and oranges") and a template cadence in the description of the lagoon's facade. These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the peak beat ("whisper battling whisper"), which, while purposeful, borders on conceptual repetition. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and highly textured, with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. However, figurative language is pervasive, creating minor density issues in high-pressure beats (e.g., "slumbering beast breathing softly") that slightly slow momentum without obscuring closure. There are no loops, scaffold, or coherence errors. Information density is high.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a near-paraphrase loop ("The frustration of these incomplete repairs had become a constant companion, like a shadow") and the aforementioned slightly elevated phrasing in the key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and propelled by strong verbs, with high information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "luminous regret" and its recurrence creates a slight synonym loop that, while purposeful, slightly dulls the immediacy of the peak emotional beat. Otherwise, rhythm and clarity are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density—e.g., the crocodile tooth's history is woven into action. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during pursuit and breathing in the cave. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final line recharges the harp motif without summary.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs of character, setting, and theme. A minor instance of potential register drift ("proprioceptively enhanced awareness") is voice-motivated and thus not penalized. No loops or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. A minor paraphrase loop exists with the repeated phrase "hidden details in paintings," and the description "elusively tangible" reappears, creating a slight scaffold that prevents a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "weightless burden" is repeated, which, while thematically resonant, creates a slight template cadence. However, this does not obscure closure or causality. Sentences are propulsive and vividly concrete ("dust dancing in the dim afternoon light").

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is densely poetic and highly effective, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Most sentences advance multiple jobs of character, setting, and plot. A minor deduction for occasional slight over-writing ("liquefied and flowed away" risks synonym churn) and a moment of register drift ("negotiable firmament"), though clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. There is a minor instance of template cadence ("He began to write, his words flowing...") but it is not pervasive and does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative texture without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and propulsive. There is a tendency toward rich figurative language that, while beautiful, occasionally flirts with overwriting ("a symphony of echoes that lingered like perfume"). However, this does not obscure clarity or causality, and the sentence-level rhythm remains strong, especially in climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion without loops or artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("hinged awakening," "resonant hush"). Sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative pattern, and the closure image is undulled by scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, a minor artifact is present: the phrase "turbine-hum reverie" is repeated verbatim three times, creating a slight template cadence that dulls its effect. The phrasing is effective, but the exact repetition feels more patterned than voice-motivated. This does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    High information density with clear propulsion and no figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with the emotional intensity. Minor decorative phrasing ("dancing like scattered embers") prevents higher scoring, but closure remains untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely clean, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language is generally well-controlled and purposeful. A minor -0.3 deduction for a subtle template cadence in the opening lines ("tracing... haunted by..."), though this does not significantly harm clarity or momentum. Sentence-level rhythm is strong and supports the accumulative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic control. However, a repetitive stem ("false comfort") and a minor paraphrase loop ("rejecting the false comfort" / "rejected the false comfort") create a slight scaffold artifact, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite, dense, and purposeful, with strong sensory detail and varied sentence structure. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward ornate phrasing in places (e.g., "velvet disquiet," "arboreal intuition") which, while voice-motivated, borders on overwriting and momentarily slows momentum. However, these do not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly evocative with exceptional information density. A minor register drift occurs with the slightly abstract phrase "texture of borrowed time" in the climax, but it is quickly grounded in the concrete "texture of herself." No loops, scaffolds, or muddle obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. Figurative language, such as "sky met the peaks like a whispered promise," is purposeful and taught. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, accelerating with the gathering storm.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is pattern-taught and functional, avoiding muddle. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on "cosmic" as a modifier, but clarity at closure is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously ("Sunlight fractured through the cracked glass domes"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single minor artifact: "tranquilly perceptive" edges toward label-speak but is immediately dramatized and embodied in the next line.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in phrases like "temporal resonance," which feels slightly academic for the POV's lexicon at peak intensity, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifact: the phrase "a palimpsest of nature's own making" introduces a slightly academic register that feels mildly dissonant with the poet's otherwise organic lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potential scaffold exists in "architectural secrets revealed... architectural secrets no longer secrets," but it is pattern-taught and does not harm closure. No figurative muddle or momentum loss in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery ("like celestial confetti," "bronze quiet"). Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story, character, and atmosphere. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward decorative phrasing in a few spots (e.g., "luminous skeptic," "academically rebellious") which, while voice-motivated, occasionally edges toward label-ness. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong and purposeful, with a good rhythm and vivid imagery. However, minor instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("fragile embrace," "submerged concord") create small drags on momentum. The sentence-level craft is otherwise proficient and serves the story's accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. There is a minor instance of repetitive phrasing ("wild hush" appears three times) which slightly dulls the final recurrence, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive, concrete, and free of scaffolding or figurative muddle. The closure beat is clear and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward synonym churn ("blessed pariah," "gifted and shunned") and a template cadence in a few consecutive sentences starting with "The...". These do not significantly obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive. There is high information density, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. Minor deduction for a few slightly ornate phrases ("chivalrous thief," "sacredly playful") that feel like thesaurus-churn amidst otherwise strong, specific language.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and poetic, with high information density and varied rhythm. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight paraphrase loop ("luminous absence" appears three times) and a moment of near-diagnostic language in the final paragraph ("totally, she embraced her luminous absence"). These do not obscure closure but slightly dilute the line-level precision elsewhere achieved.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("magnificent bookstore mountain") and a template cadence in the sentence beginning "The mercury-glass seer wandered...". These are minor artifacts that do not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Sentences accelerate with the ticking clock ("He worked faster now") without losing clarity. Figurative language ("woven hush," "liquid metal") is consistent and purposeful, enhancing the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative stacking in high-pressure beats (e.g., "listening spirits," "ghosts of forgotten possibilities") creates a hint of overlay without obscuring clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but risks overwriting in peaks (e.g., "kintsugi intentions" feels slightly academic). Figurative language is generally coherent and pattern-taught. Rhythm supports the accumulative design, though some sentences could benefit from tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery, but minor overwriting occurs—e.g., "porcelain impossibility" strains logic—and a few complex sentences could benefit from tightening. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; figurative language is generally purposeful, though one mixed metaphor ("temporary eternity" as "footprints in sand or love's first blush") slightly muddles coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, a minor scaffold phrase ("screaming tenderness") is repeated, and the clause "pure intent having bridged the distance" slightly disrupts the sentence-level rhythm with a nominalization. These are hairline slips that do not obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description. Minor overwriting appears in adjacent sentences like "Each piece told a story, each scar a landmark," creating a slight paraphrase loop that slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor register drift occurs with the phrase "fractured grace," which feels slightly more elevated than the POV's established lexicon, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is highly accomplished with vivid, precise imagery and strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for a few moments of potential overwriting ("dreamscape of opalescence and shadow") and a slight register elevation in the climax ("transform into connection") that, while voice-motivated, slightly softens the peak beat's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely lucid and propulsive, with vivid, concrete imagery. A minor metaphor stack ("phosphorescent flowers carpeted stone walls like stars") in a high-pressure beat creates a slight density bump, and the phrase "lingering promise" is repeated, but these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the grotto description ("lacy menace," "delicate predators," "luminescent tears") which, while beautiful, clusters in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, the language is precise and propulsive, with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though occasional phrases like "density of presence" verge on abstract. Rhythm is purposeful and supports scene pressure. No significant loops or artifacts; sentence-level propulsion is strong, particularly in the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("cosmic storyteller weaving its own tale") slightly softens clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates appropriately with the climax. Read-aloud test reveals careful cadence control.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is polished and evocative with strong rhythm and sensory detail. A minor instance of synonym churn ("ordinary miracles" / "new connections") slightly reduces density, but clarity and propulsion are excellent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is very strong with high information density and clear propulsion. However, a minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "vapors coiling upward like miniature dragons," "rune taking shape like a living creature"), which, while not muddying clarity, slightly softens the peak moment's impact and prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "ethereal grit voice" is a slightly contradictory metaphor that momentarily muddles clarity in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight template cadence in listing contradictory truths ("creation and destruction, beginning and end...") and a register drift in the final paragraph's "language of pure mathematics and emotion," which feels slightly elevated for the POV.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact exists: the repetition of "fjord quiet" (first as "too loud," then as a "companion") and "razor edges," while thematically intentional, edges toward a synonym loop that slightly dulls the closure image's impact. Figurative language is otherwise coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold or loops. Figurative language is generally effective, though the "quiet wildfire" metaphor, while vivid, is slightly over-extended and risks abstraction at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and propulsion, with sentences that advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. There is minor figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "clover melancholy"), but it is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. A single instance of near-paraphrase ("lucid contradictions" catalogued then lived) causes a slight momentum drag but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly evocative and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. A single minor artifact exists: the simile "pipes snaking along the ceiling like metallic intestines" is slightly mixed (snaking/intestinal), creating a minor coherence slip that does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and a few near-synonyms ("strange haunted euphoria"). These do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("His laugh echoed... a performance that had become as essential"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density, though it occasionally leans into dense figurative language ("quiet blaze of sensation") that slightly slows momentum in high-pressure beats. No loops, scaffold, or artifactual issues. Sentence-level propulsion is generally excellent, advancing story and character seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm. Figurative language ("time flowed like twisted ribbons") enhances without muddling. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Sentences advance story and character simultaneously. Final image ("stars seemed to wink") resonates without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential register drift exists ("scattered diamonds" is a common metaphor), but it is an isolated case that does not create a pattern or harm clarity. The closure beat is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythm and minimal scaffolding. Figurative language ("volcanic tenderness") is pattern-taught and paid off. Minor deduction for synonym churn ("forgotten promise" echoed as "broken promise") and a template cadence in two consecutive sentences starting "Maya's..." near the end. Clarity remains uncompromised.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though some metaphors verge on mixed ("ghost in the machine of her mind" slightly clashes with the quantum premise). Information density is high, and sentences advance character and atmosphere. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor synonym loop occurs ("folded maps" → "navigation papers") but does not harm closure. Rhythm is controlled, and sentences vary effectively to build tension towards the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension") and a template cadence in describing the shutters ("Opening some, closing others..."). However, these artifacts do not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely. Figurative language ("forests of second thoughts") is purposeful and effective. No significant loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A minor instance of potential telling ("his motivation remained clear") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "combative tenderness" encapsulates conflict). Minor issues include a slight synonym churn ("unlocking of doors...firmly guarded") and a near-paraphrase loop ("great emptiness" / "dreams had once lived"), but these do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic but occasionally dense with figurative language ("sliced the sky," "re-made hush") that, while beautiful, creates minor texture overload in a few high-pressure beats. However, it never obscures causality or closure. Sentence-level propulsion and clarity remain strong, with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, some near-paraphrase occurs (e.g., "dissolving boundaries" repeated), and a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats creates minor density without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though the final paragraph's summary of the theme ("awakenings come not when we demand them...") slightly abstracts the earned resonance, creating a minor scaffold artifact. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush, rhythmic, and highly controlled, with excellent read-aloud flow. Minor deductions for a few instances of near-paraphrase (e.g., "texture of connection" repeated) and a slightly over-stacked modifier ("powerfully gentle nature of discovery"). However, these are minor and do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in the opening paragraph ("between dimensions," "darkest moment") that briefly risks ornamentation before the voice solidifies. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise flawless and serves the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion, with varied sentence structures and strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats ("each drop a universe of possibility"), but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished and evocative with strong information density. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the high-pressure climax (e.g., "atoms of nostalgia," "constellation"), which, while beautiful, creates a minor muddle in an otherwise clear propulsion toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythmic control and information density. However, a minor figurative density appears in the high-pressure climax ("luminous regret," "origami in reverse," "metamorphose"), applying a slight deduction. Otherwise, the language is concise, vivid, and propulsive, with sentence-level variety supporting the emotional cadence. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the phrase "profound wisdom in its ancient DNA," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a reflective beat. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, dense, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple layers of story and atmosphere simultaneously. A single, minor instance of potential synonym churn ("closure seeker who had found her own peace") prevents a perfect score, but it does not harm closure or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward overwriting in peak beats, with a cluster of dense figurative language ("untended gardens of human emotion," "quantum archive") that momentarily slows momentum without breaking clarity. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, avoiding muddle. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere with concision.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly controlled and vivid, with strong rhythmic variation and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and cohesive. Minor deductions for a few abstract labels ("fractured lullaby of existence") and a template cadence in "Through wave functions, he could charm...".

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is highly polished, with excellent rhythm, clarity, and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. There is no scaffolding, synonym churn, or repetitive phrasing. A very minor flaw is a single instance of potential conceptual redundancy in the climax ("crescendoed into comprehension that struck him with the force of probable miracles"), where the impact is stated rather than fully embodied, but this is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting and a tendency toward stacked modifiers ("gentle persistence of tides that never cease their pull") create slight density in high-pressure beats, slightly obscuring momentum. The final closure image remains clear and potent. No loops or scaffolding artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("frostbitten hope") is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final line resolves with a powerful image.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, though occasional overwriting ("regally unpretentious heir" appears twice) creates minor scaffold. Figurative language remains coherent, and closure beats maintain clarity despite some decorative density.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits strong rhythmic control and information density, with sentences doing multiple jobs (tapping rhythm mirrors data patterns). One minor template cadence occurs with three "always" phrases in the first paragraph, and a slight metaphor strain in "digital coastlines bled... like watercolors" slightly muddles the digital/analog comparison. No artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exceptional with high information density and vivid imagery. A subtle instance of overwriting occurs in the high-pressure beat describing her transformation, using a series of declarative synonyms ("regal, something timeless, something that commanded") that slightly dull the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentence-level rhythm is varied and purposeful. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle are present. The final paragraph lands with powerful clarity and resonance, devoid of artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density with minimal scaffolding. Minor paraphrase loop ("pearl of stillness" repeated) slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't obscure closure. Prose maintains propulsion through varied sentence structures and concrete imagery. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "gray oblivion," "luminescent ache"), which, while beautiful, creates a density that momentarily slows momentum. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is densely poetic and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting in its descriptive density (e.g., "intricate pattern," "hidden geometries"), which slightly slows momentum in a short piece. No loops or scaffolding artifacts, and clarity is maintained even at the peak beat of dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is concise and propelled, with high information density (e.g., "data frozen in amber-light"). Minor figurative language ("ripples spreading outward") is purposeful and doesn't muddle clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "a thread of meaning woven through the tapestry of chaos" do multiple jobs without padding. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The read-aloud rhythm is excellent, varying naturally to support the accumulative build.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with varied sentence structures and read-aloud rhythm. Minor deduction for slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "divine electricity" feels slightly jarring). No loops or scaffolding; closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good information density. However, there is some repetitive phrasing ("echoing observatory" appears 3 times, "orbits of regret" 3 times) that creates a slight template cadence. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but the repetition prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished, with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. A very slight tendency toward decorative phrasing ("meteor hush") is the only minor flaw, but it does not obscure sense or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong momentum and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and cohesive. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop: "emergent hush" is powerfully introduced but reiterated several times without significant added pressure or detail, slightly dulling its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward ornate phrasing in a few spots (e.g., "aberrant mercy—giving names to places that had lost theirs—was his gift"), which creates a small momentum drag. However, the line-level craft is otherwise exemplary, with high information density and no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly sensory, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor pattern of dense, complex sentences creates occasional slight momentum drag in high-pressure beats (e.g., "The synesthetic ghost pushed his voice higher..."). This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure, but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Rhythm is well-controlled, though a few sentences in reflective moments could be tighter. A minor instance of potential register drift with "willowglass hope" prevents a higher score, but it does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propelled, with vivid imagery and rhythmic variation. However, slight scaffold phrases ("a truly factually mystical phenomenon") and a template cadence in peak beats ("Maya approached... When she reached out...") incur a minor deduction. Figurative language remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythmic control. However, some repetitive phrasing ("quietly inspired," "shared wisdom") and a tendency toward summary in the final paragraphs create minor scaffold artifacts that slightly dull the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the storm within him raged as violently as the winds") which creates a mild artifact, and a single paraphrase loop ("fixing what's broken" appears twice in close succession). Overall, propulsion and clarity are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere concisely. Minor figurative language ("stretched the fabric of reality") is pattern-taught and pays off, causing no muddle. No significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. Sentences are dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("The bees too, though dormant, turned slightly in their frames as he passed, their antennae sensing not warmth but intention"). There is zero scaffolding or looped phrasing. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly integrated ("phototropic to kindness"). The read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling, with a perfect final sentence that resolves the narrative arc.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a text artifact exists: the phrase "quivering hush" is repeated, creating a minor template cadence. There is also a slight overlay of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("crystallize," "liquid mercury") that, while beautiful, edges toward density without a clear pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, though a template cadence emerges in lists like "with the library's tides, with her past lives..." Information density is high, and closure is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lyrical, high-density prose with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor instances of near-paraphrase ("prismatic quiet" appears thrice) slightly dull the closure image but do not significantly harm momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight scaffold phrase ("For the first time in months, silence filled the radio room") which states what the preceding action has already shown. Otherwise, sentence-level craft is strong, with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong sensory detail and varied sentence structure. A few minor artifacts exist, like the slightly odd verb "transfix" and a near-paraphrase loop describing the compass point's energy. These do not significantly harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise, propulsive, and largely free of artifacts. Sentences vary in structure and length to create a compelling rhythm. Information density is high, with lines often doing double duty (e.g., describing the quarry while establishing mood). No loops or scaffold issues were detected.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and propulsive, with high information density. A slight scaffold is detected in the second paragraph, which uses a similar sentence structure to deliver backstory ("After the jet stream had shifted..."). However, this is a minor artifact that does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush, precise, and highly evocative, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward decorative phrasing in peak beats (e.g., "symphony of pixelated amnesty"), but the language never obscures causality or the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished and precise, with high information density and varied sentence structure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph's rhythm expertly supports the closure beat. Minor repetition of "perceptively calm" and "polished calm" is the only slight artifact, but it is voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose has rhythmic control and high information density without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("slipping away like sand") serves pressure. Sentence variety supports momentum, though minor scaffold exists in "understanding was dawning" repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("branches heavy with fruit that whispered secrets") is purposeful and enhances atmosphere without muddying clarity. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating and breathing effectively with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("root-bound," "purposefully curious") in the opening, creating a hint of pattern cadence, though it resolves quickly.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, accelerating with the memory's approach ("air grew cold") and breathing at closure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Minor deduction: "feathers of resolve" is a slightly mixed metaphor, though voice-motivated. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and sentence openings vary effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete detail. Minor deduction for a slight repetitive cadence in two adjacent sentences describing memory ("He remembered..."). Information density is high, and the closure lands with clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally dense and purposeful, but minor artifacts appear, like the slightly overworked simile "shimmer like a heat mirage on a desert highway." Rhythm is strong, and sentences advance character and atmosphere. No loops or scaffolding obscure closure, though a few phrases lean decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, precise imagery. A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the final paragraph ("a perfect harmony") which, while beautiful, slightly softens the sharpness of the preceding concrete images. Otherwise, clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose maintains high information density and rhythmic control, particularly in the crown transformation sequence. Minor artifact: "liquid sunlight" slightly strains the established tactile lexicon. No loops or scaffolding issues; sentence-level propulsion accelerates appropriately during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful metaphor ("ivy that clawed at brickwork like desperate fingers"). Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the peak beat ("some currents cannot be charted...") which, while thematically apt, leans slightly declarative.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats ("sentences turned to vapor before they could be born") and a template cadence in the final paragraph's reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and heightens the closure. Sentences are propulsive and varied, expertly balancing atmospheric description with advancing action. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is lucid and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle or register drift. There are no observable loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly competent with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, it occasionally trends toward decorative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "patterns like scallop shells across weathered bark" followed by similar imagery later), applying a slight penalty for overwriting. The closure image remains clear and potent, and the sentence-level propulsion is generally excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor figurative density appears in phrases like "the cloak of doubt he wore so professionally had become almost a second skin," which, while effective, slightly stacks metaphors. The closure beat remains clear and unaffected by this minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Figurative language ("like the magnetic grotto below us") is purposeful and coherent. A minor scaffold loop occurs with "sycamore hush" (used twice), creating slight repetition. Sentences propel the accumulative momentum effectively, and the final paragraph’s cadence shifts to support closure without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly crafted with strong rhythm, though it risks density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "pathways through dimensional spaces"). A minor paraphrase loop exists ("navigate without moving" appears twice in close succession), preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. The description of the keystone's light "troubling the very air" is a strong, specific image. A minor text artifact exists with the non-translated Russian word "волшебные," which creates a slight register drift and momentary clarity break, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "meteor hush of anticipation"), though it remains coherent and largely serves the tone.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include the slightly jargony phrase "wavelength align" and a template cadence in "His quiet enthusiasm had sustained him... even as stellar doubt began to creep." These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with varied rhythm and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("The echo of sacrifice resonated... reminding him"). One minor synonym loop ("scattered light" used thrice in close succession) slightly impacts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high; sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. A minor instance of potential label-speak exists ("earnestly naive"), but it is character-consistent and does not cluster in peak beats. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles to obscure the clarity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, the phrase "mirrored hush" is a mixed metaphor that slightly muddles clarity in a peak beat. This minor artifact prevents a higher score but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic propulsion. Minor figurative density appears in the climax (e.g., "heart beating in rhythm with the ancient freshness"), and the phrase "ancient freshness" is repeated, creating a slight decorative loop that slightly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density, but suffers from a template-cadence issue. The repetitive use of the story's required elements as sentence openers ("The watcher's burden," "Attentively inventive," "Remembering through muscle memory") creates a noticeable pattern that slightly dulls momentum, though it doesn't break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong information density. A minor deduction for a slight scaffold in the custody battle explanation paragraph, which risks slowing momentum. Figurative language is well-controlled and purposeful, especially in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a text artifact is present: a pattern of repetitive stems ("flow," "possibility") and a tendency toward synonym churn (e.g., "nocturnal sanctuary," "nocturnal haven") slightly dulls the closure image. The artifact does not break causality but reduces precision.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing action, character, and atmosphere. There is a very slight tendency toward synonymous phrasing (e.g., "mournfully eager" used multiple times) which prevents a perfect score, but no major artifacts obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. One minor figurative strain ("oceans of liquid starlight" feels slightly decorative). No loops or scaffolding; closure image lands with clarity despite poetic density.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and highly specific, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, it occasionally risks overwriting, such as the slightly mixed metaphor of "winter finding purchase in autumn's resistance," which creates a minor muddle in a key beat. The information density is high, and every sentence advances atmosphere or character, but a slight tightening could elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("serenely electric," "latent energy") and one potentially mixed metaphor ("shard of hush"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor figurative overload in phrases like "lover returning from long absence" slightly strains coherence but doesn't obscure closure. Rhythm varies effectively; no loops or scaffolding artifacts. Sentence-level craft supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. Minor instances of rich figurative language ("branching out like an infinite tree") are pattern-taught and serve the accumulative design without muddling sense.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off (e.g., "bioluminescent algae drift past like terrestrial stars"). Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting scene needs. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "balancedly curious," but it doesn't harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. However, the phrase "reeling hush" is repeated three times, creating a minor template cadence that slightly dulls the closure image. No other significant artifacts or muddles are present in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong momentum, though it occasionally leans into slightly over-written metaphor ("yawned before her like a tired giant"). A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "phase transitions" and "whatever came next," but this does not measurably obscure the cause/effect chain or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor instance of potential register drift ("digital ghost existence") is brief and arguably voice-motivated, causing no material harm to clarity or momentum. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent. A minor deduction for a few instances of potential scaffold phrasing ("quietly articulate," "quietly laughed") and a slight register elevation in the final paragraph, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density ("gravitationally playful," "frostbitten hope"). Minor deduction for a slight register drift in the "cosmic joke" line, which feels slightly elevated compared to the POV's grounded observational lexicon. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and free of loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery that advances the story. Information density is high; sentences often perform double duty, building atmosphere while advancing plot or character. A minor loop exists with the repetition of "resonantly soft," which slightly dulls the precision of the final line. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("thunderstorm in a bottle," "network of gaps"). Sentence structure varies effectively, from short, tense beats to longer, reflective passages. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; the closure image lands with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density ("pulsing with a whispering gleam"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the song's crescendo. Minor hairline slip: slight telling in the climax ("transforming the silence into a symphony") briefly abstracts the beat, but clarity remains intact. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion is strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences (e.g., "Observed solitude was her natural state" slightly paraphrases prior ideas), but clarity remains. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lyrical yet precise, with high information density and varied sentence structure. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent, though occasional phrases like "luminous absence" approach decorative repetition. No significant loops or artifacts obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm, clarity, and information density. Figurative language is generally effective and purposeful. A minor deduction for a cluster of three adjacent metaphors in a high-pressure beat ("pulsing like a captured star," "wrapped in layers of doubt," "destroy their keeper"), which creates a slight density overload without a clear pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lucid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) for a template cadence in the climax: "Images flooded her mind—not returned memories exactly, but visions..." and for the slightly muddled metaphor of "consciousness knit back together," which dulls the clarity of a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, vivid imagery, and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The line "the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" is a standout example of concision and atmosphere working in perfect tandem.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("verdant parapet" is used repeatedly) and a template cadence in lists of what the pruner will do next. These do not touch the closure beat or obscure cause and effect.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density, though occasional over-writing appears ("a tinkersong wonder that echoed"). There is a minor figurative muddle in that phrase, but it does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. No loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density (e.g., "crystalline walls fracturing the light"). Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward decryption. Minor template cadence in floor transitions ("At floor X...") is pattern-taught and functional, not disruptive. No loops or artifacts obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a subtle instance of conceptual redundancy between "spooled wholeness" and the gondola "hanging between worlds" in close proximity, creating a slight paraphrase effect. The closure beat remains clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor issue: slight repetition of "heightened stillness" (first and final paragraphs) creates a subtle loop, but it does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating with discovery. Figurative language ("constellations on the floor") is purposeful and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. A minor figurative muddle exists in "stranded luminance" which feels slightly academic for the voice. However, sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative pattern-building effectively, and no significant loops or scaffolds dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and beautiful rhythmic control. However, a pattern of slightly overwrought figurative language appears, such as "hinges groaning like old memories," which, while evocative, creates a mild density issue in high-pressure beats without a clear payoff. The sentence-level propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm, vivid imagery, and clear propulsion. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "brambled hope" conveys tone and cost). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety and information density. A minor deduction for potential overwriting in the peak beat ("fractured starlight and liquid shadow" risks slight figurative density), but it remains coherent and does not obscure the closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight repetition of key phrases ("graceless beauty," "offhandedly exact") and a filter verb ("he knew") in a high-pressure beat. These do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clean and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting, such as "symphonically minded scientist," which feels slightly decorative. No major loops or artifacts; information density is high, and sentences advance character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight repetition of "mindfully scattered" and a potential register drift in phrases like "quantifying absence," though this is largely voice-motivated. The closure beat remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density and no artifacts. Figurative language ("remorse crystallized like ice") is pattern-taught and payoff-linked. Rhythm accelerates during the transformation beat, and sentence structures vary naturally. Minor deduction for "unspoken dream" being slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm. However, some repetitive phrasing ("harmonious," "vigorous tender") and a slight overuse of the "borrowed starlight" motif create minor artifacts. The closure image remains clear and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without losing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion expertly mirrors the protagonist's spiraling consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor synonym churn appears with "clandestinely luminous" used three times, creating a slight template cadence. This does not obscure closure but slightly dulls the precision of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. A minor figurative stack in the climax (“whispered melodies,” “prisms of sound”) slightly mutes clarity but does not obscure closure. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts detract from momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence structures and rhythmic control. Minor scaffold exists in the repeated phrase "Elias was thoughtfully precise," but it serves character consistency. Figurative language ("hopeful melancholy") is integrated without muddle. The final paragraph achieves clarity and resonance without artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is highly polished with zero loops or scaffold. Information density is high, and figurative language is purposeful and coherent, e.g., "the resonant hollow where memories yet echo." Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, and clarity is maintained even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifact is the slightly forced phrase "olfactorily sensitive," which creates a small register bump, but it does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deduction for a slight repetition of "whirling silence" which, while likely intentional, edges toward a template cadence. Information density is high and propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is precise, vivid, and highly efficient, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("long shadows in the dying afternoon light"). A single instance of potentially ornamental phrasing ("talisman of sorts") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, though occasionally dense with figurative language ("sculpted hush unfurled like a lotus"). A minor paraphrase loop occurs near the end ("wonder made manifest" / "wonder was not merely decorative but essential"), slightly dulling the closure's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor artifact exists: the adverb "avalanchingly" is a notable register drift that feels slightly manufactured for effect, creating a small bump in an otherwise seamless read. This prevents a score above 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lucid and precise, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. A single minor artifact appears ("calculations" used twice in close succession), but it does not obscure clarity or momentum, especially in the key closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle appears in the peak beat: "wonder blooming literally in her wake" slightly contradicts the established magical logic of sympathetic vibration, creating a small coherence artifact that touches the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a few instances of slightly clunky phrasing ("timeframe when assumptions shatter") and a trace of synonym churn ("shifted hush," "meaningful silence"). These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("raveling silence," "hush of time's unraveling tapestry") is consistent, pattern-taught, and enhances clarity rather than muddling it. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, varying rhythm to accelerate and breathe with scene needs. Read-aloud quality is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., the silk's description also reveals character perception). A minor loop exists with the phrase "azure defiance" used twice, incurring a small deduction. Otherwise, rhythm is controlled, and figurative language is coherent and supports pressure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive with excellent rhythmic control. A minor artifact is present: the phrase "cyclically and spontaneous" is slightly awkward and feels like a thesaurus-driven synonym pair, creating a small stumble in an otherwise polished line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is polished and economical, with high information density and varied syntax. No loops or artifacts; figurative language ("like a solitary promise") is purposeful and legible. The final paragraph's rhythm crystallizes the thematic resonance without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm, clarity, and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A single, minor loop exists in the repetition of "shadowed elation," which acts as a scaffold phrase rather than a fully reweighted image each time.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is densely poetic with high information density and varied rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in peak beats (e.g., "quietly explosive" used twice) which creates a subtle pattern without full payoff. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences that advance multiple jobs. Rhythm varies naturally and supports scene needs. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in the peak beat. The read-aloud ear test is passed with flying colors; the language is precise and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor figurative stacking ("fractured glass," "gossamer threads") is pattern-taught and functional. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density; sentences advance story and character without scaffold. Minimal artifacts; a slight register elevation in "enlarged tranquility" is voice-motivated and consistent. Figurative language, like "nested paradoxes," is taught early and pays off, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is highly polished, with strong information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. A very minor deduction for a potential scaffold phrase ("after the birds flew south") used in both the opening and closing, though its repetitive use is arguably purposeful and lyrical rather than a mechanical artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice; sentences advance story and atmosphere with high information density. Rhythm is varied and purposeful, with no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally concise and propulsive, with high information density. A minor loop occurs with the phrase "comforting unease" used twice, creating a slight scaffold. Otherwise, sentence-level craft is strong, with varied syntax and clear, vivid imagery supporting the high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "tasting time each breath they took"). Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with pressure. Minor figurative overreach occurs in phrases like "voting algorithms," which introduces a slightly jarring modern register. A single paraphrase loop exists ("terrestrially cosmic" is repeated frequently), but it does not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. However, a tendency toward figurative language in most sentences of high-pressure beats creates minor density issues ("auroral sorrow," "luminous echo"). A template-cadence run ("after silence, after sorrow, after rediscovery") and a minor paraphrase loop ("uncorked suppressed creativity") trigger small deductions. The propulsion and clarity remain strong, and these artifacts do not significantly obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor scaffold is present in the repeated use of "gilded-leaf calligrapher" as a descriptor. A single instance of potential synonym churn ("lost conversations" / "truths that disappeared"). Rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, supporting the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and information density. A slight deduction for a minor tendency toward ornate phrasing in a few spots (e.g., "Inspiration struck with the force of revelation"), which creates a tiny momentum drag. However, these are isolated and do not obscure causality or the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, figurative language in high-pressure beats ("electromagnetic pulses painted the sky in colors that shouldn't exist") verges on overwriting and creates a slight muddle, slightly obscuring the causal clarity of the inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with excellent rhythmic control. Sentences are varied and advance story and character effectively. Figurative language ("sandstorm calm") is sharp and purposeful. A single minor loop exists ("touched a woman who had touched so many") but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density. However, figurative language is dense in high-pressure beats (e.g., "as a spider spins its web" appears twice), creating minor rhythm drag without full pattern payoff. No loops or scaffolding, but the repetition slightly dulls the closure image. Sentences otherwise vary well and advance the story.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. A slight overwriting tendency appears in the climax ("gleaming silence of the crystal's interior"); the phrase "gleaming silence" is repeated, creating a minor decorative loop that slightly dulls the peak moment's clarity without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and generally purposeful, but risks overwriting in peak beats with phrases like "tranquil blaze" and "terrestrially cosmic." A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "quiet brook" repeated frequently. The rhythm is strong, and sentences advance the story, but some figurative language feels slightly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential thesaurus-churn ("ephemeral as forgotten words") slightly disrupts the voice's otherwise consistent texture, but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward slightly overwrought description ("tragically radiant," "luminous cheek") creates minor figurative clutter in peak beats, preventing a higher score. The closure beat remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and variation. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere. A very minor instance of potentially ornamental language ("pearl twilight glow") appears in a high-pressure beat but does not obscure clarity or causality. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythmic variation and minimal scaffolding. A minor template cadence emerges with the repeated "While the universe hummed its secret song" framing device, though it is pattern-taught and pays off. No figurative muddle; metaphors are coherent and voice-motivated. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple elements.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and economical, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Figurative language is consistent and enhances atmosphere without muddle. Minor scaffold in repetitive "salvage something pure" phrases, but they serve thematic resonance. Information density is high, advancing story and character.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifact is the slightly forced phrase "scintillatingly somber," which feels like a thesaurus choice that clashes with the POV's otherwise grounded lexicon. This prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor scaffold artifact exists ("hope was the one thing...") in the final line, which summarizes a theme already shown, slightly dulling the closure's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance multiple layers of story and atmosphere. There is no evidence of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single minor artifact: the phrase "gritty whimsy" feels slightly tell-y, but it is a contained label that doesn't disrupt the overall momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally elegant and purposeful, with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language ("tiny performers," "theater of his solitary existence") in the opening paragraph and a potential synonym churn ("positively wistful" used twice). These do not significantly obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lucid and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor figurative muddle occurs with "cracked like distant bones," a slightly strained metaphor that briefly obscures clarity. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively, with varied syntax and no significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction is applied for a slight tendency toward decorative density in phrases like "restrained wildness" and "softly purposeful," which, while voice-consistent, approach ornamentation in a high-pressure beat. The closure image, however, remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally concise and propulsive, with high information density. A minor loop exists in the repetition of "watchfully calm" and "fortified vulnerability," and the phrase "reverberate throughout the tunnel" is a slight mixed metaphor. These are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and highly atmospheric, with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("like a spirit trapped between worlds") is purposeful and taught early. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or register drifts to obscure causality or dull the potent closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. No loops or scaffold artifacts; figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("yearning algorithm hummed"). Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and peak beats maintain clarity without muddle. Minor deduction for slight repetition of "steadily curious."

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, some figurative language, like "digital necropolis" and "symphony half-remembered from a dream," feels slightly overworked and decorative, creating minor density issues in an otherwise high-tension narrative. The sentence-level rhythm and syntax effectively support the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact penalty is applied for a pattern of complex metaphor that appears in most sentences of the high-pressure climax ("like ink in water," "like the twilight hour," "from between moments in time"), which, while pattern-taught, slightly risks density over clarity at the most crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A minor rhythm plateau exists in the middle ("As the days passed..."), but it does not obscure closure or causality. No significant loops or artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is elegant and controlled with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a subtle template cadence in reflective sentences ("Drawing parallels...") and a slight over-reliance on the visual sense in some descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is excellent, with lines performing multiple jobs. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("wisdom's echo" / "echo of wisdom") and a slight register drift in the climax, but these do not measurably obscure the closure or cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and sensory density. Information is efficiently layered, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor, almost hairline slip occurs with the slightly therapeutic phrasing "masterpiece of shared understanding," but this is a single instance and does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is elegant and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("dust motes dancing in the slanted light") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is generally coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. A slight syntactic uniformity emerges in a few descriptive paragraphs (e.g., "He remembered back to the hush..."), creating a minor, rhythmic drumbeat that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor overwriting risks appear in clustered figurative language ("luminous ache," "ephemeral energies that leathered the boundaries") but do not obscure closure clarity or cause significant momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly controlled, concise, and possesses a strong read-aloud rhythm. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight repetition of the phrase "pulsing stillness" and a register drift in the line "the space between notes where love lives on" feels slightly elevated compared to the narrator's otherwise grounded lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is polished with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor scaffold ("quietly deliberate precision") appears early but doesn't obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is dense and poetic but risks overwriting in peaks (e.g., "simultaneously flesh and shadow"). Figurative language is generally coherent but occasionally stacked. Rhythm is varied and purposeful. No major loops or artifacts, but some sentences could be more concise.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for a slight paraphrase loop ("earthbound" appears frequently) and a register drift in the phrase "zephyr bloom," which feels slightly elevated for the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose exhibits high information density and varied sentence structure with strong read-aloud rhythm. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("honeyed hush deepened, wrapping around her like a balm") slightly affects clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in the list of cameos and some synonym churn ("lucidly watchful" appears twice). These do not materially obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and sensory detail. Minor deductions for a few instances of slightly ornate phrasing ("verdant arbor," "gathering hush") that, while beautiful, create minimal register drift from the character's likely internal voice.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite and purposeful, with high information density. However, minor instances of stacked modifiers ("deliberate slowness," "practiced grace") and a complex metaphor ("dance between what is and what could be") create slight density in early beats, though they do not obscure the crucial closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously ("the marble walls growing warmer as she worked"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "wonder stored in the cellar of reason," though it is character-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the atmosphere and theme. A single instance of potentially mixed metaphor ("settled like sediment") is minor and does not harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.6)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with every sentence advancing character and atmosphere. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("crystallized time," "rust-hued peace"), never muddying clarity. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; the read-aloud rhythm is flawless and serves the accumulative, meditative pace of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. It successfully walks a fine line but occasionally tips into mild overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "translucent images formed in the air before him in mesmerizing patterns"). A single, minor paraphrase loop exists ("fractured stillness" echoed shortly after introduction).

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for a light template cadence in a few adjacent sentences starting with "The..." and a single instance of potential synonym churn ("wonder" / "discovery"). These are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: the phrase "excruciatingly gentle" is repeated three times, creating a slight template cadence. However, this does not obscure closure, and the information density is high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor instance of potential register drift occurs with the phrase "serene upheaval," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's moment of peak realization, creating a small artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythmic control. A minor -0.1 deduction for a single instance of potential scaffold in "the oceanic hush that had settled over them," which slightly echoes earlier phrasing. Otherwise, sentences are concise and propel the story with high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a subtle template cadence in the sentence structure of two consecutive reflective sentences mid-story ("His obituaries for others... The autumn deepened..."), which slightly dulls the momentum in an otherwise flawlessly crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive. A minor text artifact penalty (-0.3) for a template cadence run: "He hypothesized... The assembly was nearly complete... A bitter sweetness filled..." which slightly dulls the peak beat. Otherwise, information density is high, and figurative language is coherent and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("smoke-choked," "kelp-drift peace"). A single, minor paraphrase loop ("scars can sing" is whispered and then stated) occurs but does not obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is strong and varied.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, precise imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences performing multiple duties of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a few spots (e.g., "hair catching the dim light like a luminous skeptic"), which, while beautiful, creates minor density in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with high information density. Minor figurative overloading occurs in phrases like "like tears from the cosmic garden's celestial flora," creating slight muddle, but clarity and propulsion are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and purposeful sensory detail. The prose is propulsive and devoid of scaffold or loops. A minor register drift occurs with "unsettled spirits," a slightly elevated phrase that briefly clashes with the otherwise grounded, tactile lexicon, but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures that accelerate with emotional intensity. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("Alaric understood now—his meticulous winding had been correct in principle but wrong in practice"), creating a slight paraphrase loop. Figurative language ("searing reverie") is effective and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly accomplished with strong rhythm, vivid imagery, and excellent information density. A single, minor artifact: the phrase "velveteen gloom" risks slight overwriting, feeling a touch decorative in an otherwise precise and concrete descriptive landscape. This does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor scaffold phrase appears ("practiced her craft with a groundedly imaginative approach"), telling a trait that is otherwise shown. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and propulsive with excellent rhythmic control. Minor deductions for a slight over-density of figurative language in spots (e.g., "thistled calm") and a template cadence in the paragraph beginning "The story famine had lasted..." which briefly disrupts momentum. The closure image, however, is crystal clear and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.6)
    Line-level craft is exemplary with high information density and zero artifacts. The prose is lyrical yet precise, with every sentence advancing character or atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent and legible, even in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythmic control. Minor text artifacts include a synonym loop ("sedimentary layers" repeated frequently) and some template cadence in reflective passages. However, these do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. Information density is high, and the final line lands with powerful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is elegant, controlled, and largely purposeful, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts are present, including some synonym churn ("expectantly resigned" is repeated) and a template cadence in the paragraph beginning "The choir she conducted...". These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Minor artifact: "synaptic plasticity" introduces a slightly clinical register in a peak beat, though it is quickly recontextualized. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally crisp, purposeful, and well-paced, with strong rhythmic control. A single, minor artifact: the phrase "involuntarily truthful" is used in the narration after being established, feeling slightly label-like in its repetition. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally high with vivid, purposeful description and strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("hushed blaze") and a few instances of near-paraphrase ("displaced things," "seemingly insignificant objects") that create subtle scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly evocative with excellent rhythmic control and sensory detail. Minor artifacting appears in a near-paraphrase loop: "thread the truth through the structural weakness" and later "thread your way through the structural weakness," which slightly dulls the final, crucial line.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences ("grim optimism" repeated in first and final paragraphs), but this does not obscure closure clarity or cause momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. There is a minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "saffron quiet" and "linguistic connection," but the figurative language is largely coherent and purposeful. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Exquisite, high-density prose with strong rhythmic control. A tendency toward ornate description ("rosewater dread") creates minor density spikes, but the propulsion never fully stalls. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is elegant and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the climax ("sound that resonated not through air but through time itself"), which, while effective, borders on abstraction in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, clean and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythmic control and information density. Sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere simultaneously. There is a very minor tendency toward abstraction in peak beats (e.g., "pure potential"), but it does not obscure clarity or harm the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally clean with high information density and zero loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("ocean into mercury") is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating during the storm sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished, with strong rhythmic control and clear propulsion. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "sunwashed dread" conveys mood, time, and sensation). No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle are present. Minor, voice-motivated flourishes are consistent and do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences effectively advance story and atmosphere. A minor instance of near-synonym churn exists ("concealment and intentional distortion"), and a slight register elevation ("industrial expansion palatable") is noticeable but does not significantly harm clarity or momentum, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for mild overwriting in the sunset description ("hushed blaze of oranges and purples") which, while beautiful, slightly slows the momentum of the closure beat without adding crucial pressure or meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from a template-cadence issue with the repetitive use of the assigned phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness"). This artifact slightly dulls the closure's immediacy, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity. No significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected. The language successfully sustains the story's ethereal tone.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Minor scaffold exists in the repeated "bleak exhilaration" phrase, but it does not obscure closure or cause significant momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from mild overwriting and a template cadence in places (e.g., "Her perpetually surprised features tightened..."). Figurative language is sometimes over-applied, creating a slight density that obscures immediacy without payoff, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "sieved hush" envelopes him and filters the world). A minor deduction for the triple use of "sieved hush," which, while poetic, creates a slight pattern artifact that dulls the final reprise. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Sentences advance multiple elements simultaneously (e.g., "the antique drawer pull felt warm in her hand" combines character, object, and supernatural element). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("anchor and albatross") is precise and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final paragraph demonstrates masterful propulsion and clarity, landing the closure image with power. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor instance of slightly elevated diction ("jaded wonder") creates a small register drift. Rhythm is well-controlled, and sentences effectively advance story and atmosphere without significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts appear, including a paraphrase loop ("no longer just Eliora, no longer just a beast whisperer") and a tendency toward elevated diction in peak beats that slightly dulls immediacy. The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and variation. However, a density of figurative language in high-pressure beats creates a mild momentum drag; phrases like "specimens in the amber of time" and "choking beauty" are effective but clustered, applying a -0.4 deduction. Information density is otherwise high, and sentence-level propulsion is strong, carrying the reader to the powerful closure. The final line's clarity is untouched by this minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structure. Information is layered effectively without padding. Minor instances of synonymous phrasing ("spectral ghost," "dim memory") and a complex metaphor or two slightly reduce clarity but do not harm momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. However, a minor paraphrase loop occurs with the repetition of "vibrant hush" and "whispering hush," which slightly dulls immediacy. Figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("vigilant lock sentinel," "calm inventiveness") and the phrase "winking hush" feels slightly contrived. However, these do not obscure causality or dull the potent closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with high information density. Rhythm is varied and purposeful. A minor deduction for a cluster of figurative language in a high-pressure beat ("swirling with impossible colors," "ethereal glow," "sinuous bodies") that slightly mutes the immediacy of the climax, though it does not break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sensory detail. Minor overwriting occurs ("storm-kissed wonder" feels slightly decorative), but no loops or artifacts harm clarity. Momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally excellent, with high information density and varied syntax that creates a compelling rhythm. However, a minor figurative density issue exists; the phrase "dignified chaos" is repeated, and the cluster of metaphors in the opening ("prismatic chaos," "endless question") creates a slight initial muddle before the voice solidifies. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor figurative stacking in peaks (e.g., "luminous fracture" repetition) slightly mutes clarity but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolds; sentence-level propulsion advances story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Sentences advance multiple jobs of character, setting, and plot. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward lyrical abstraction in phrases like "surprising fate with an unplanned encore," which leans declarative. However, this is balanced by concrete, tactile language elsewhere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("collective memory," "stories and traditions," "knowledge beyond her years") and the somewhat precious phrase "luminous doubt," which introduces a minor figurative muddle at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures and strong sensory specificity. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("tides of remembrance"). Minor artifacts: "cerulean regret" borders on decorative abstraction, and "RBG hands" is an unclear detail. However, propulsion is maintained, and closure clarity is unharmed. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple layers.

    Imagery is polished and mostly disciplined, with strong verbs and purposeful motifs; a few purple tinges (“prismatic tears,” “cosmic whispers”) skirt excess without tipping into muddle. Sentences carry momentum and do more than one job. Some summarizing in the latter third trims immediacy but preserves clarity. No notable loops, scaffolding, or cadence artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean, evocative lines with good cadence; images do double duty for mood and meaning. Occasional paraphrase/abstraction loops and repeated terms (“fierce tenderness,” “singing spirits”) add a hint of sameness. Mostly shows via action and image; minimal scaffolding. The final image is clear and unblurred by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is polished with strong sensory texture and purposeful repetition (coral, mist, smudge). Some lines over‑explain theme or double a point (“shared anxieties,” “mission was clear”), creating light redundancy and faint purple edges. Information density remains high and syntax varied. The final image is clean and unblurred by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clear and mostly lean, with images doing double duty (light as restorative art). Some lines edge toward summary or sentiment (“she knew better”), softening momentum. No major loops or figurative muddle; rhythm varies adequately. Information density holds, though a few statements repeat theme rather than advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally lucid and evocative, with effective sensory layering. Occasional purple edges and minor redundancy around the awakenings slightly slow momentum, and the typo noted above harms polish. Most sentences do multiple jobs, and figurative logic is coherent. The final image lands cleanly despite mild overwriting earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean syntax and purposeful imagery carry momentum despite expository density. Minor repetition (“converging chaos”) and some telling lines could be trimmed for crisper impact. Sentences often do double duty (world rule + tactic), and the final image lands cleanly. No figurative muddle or artifacting that impairs clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines carry high imagery density with few muddles; repeated phrases act as leitmotifs rather than loops. Syntax varies and momentum holds across centuries without slack. A touch of purple risk is present but rarely obscures meaning. Final cadence is clean and image-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush yet mostly precise; images carry multiple jobs (worldbuilding, mood, theme). Occasional density risks purple but avoids mixed metaphors, and momentum holds through the ritual sequence. Minimal scaffolding or loops; syntax varies to support cadence. Final lines land cleanly via image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean and image‑driven, with good information density and purposeful sentence variety. Some paraphrase loops and mantra‑like repetitions slightly dull momentum. Figurative language generally lands, but a few intensifiers and restated stakes could be trimmed. The final lines are crisp and visually decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line-level craft is clean with good image economy (light through cracks, rusted chain) and forward motion. There’s mild overwriting and repetition of signature metaphors, plus occasional echoing (trembling/resolve) that could be tightened. Syntax varies and sequencing is clear. No major scaffold loops, though a few lines paraphrase adjacent content.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry layered work—image, theme, and action—without collapsing into muddle; repetitions (“dust motes,” “paper trails”) are pattern‑taught and pay off. Minor density spikes flirt with overwriting but remain legible and purposeful. Momentum holds through paragraphing and syntactic variety; minimal scaffolding. The final cadence is crisp and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic control and image density propel the piece, with purposeful repetitions.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines are mostly clean with pleasing cadence and selective imagery; the bioluminescent “living stars” sequence sings. There’s some purple tint and redundancy (reiterated wonder, repeated descriptors) that could be tightened. Metaphors stay coherent; momentum is steady, if unhurried. The closing paragraph could compress to avoid moralizing echo.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean and often beautiful, with purposeful motifs and clear syntax. Some paraphrase loops and repeated thesis statements reduce density and momentum in the final third. Figurative choices are coherent, though occasionally on-the-nose. The final image is clear and not dulled by clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and image-forward; sentences often do double duty.

    Strong line work with purposeful images (“tiny bells,” “sacred geometry”) and clean syntax; momentum holds. Minor redundancy creeps in via reiterative labels (philanthropist/amoral) and a few explanatory sentences in the final third. Figurative density stays coherent; no mixed metaphors. Tightening a handful of summarizing clauses could further elevate.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line‑level craft is polished but leans into repetition and abstraction that occasionally feel redundant or purple. Several phrases re‑assert the same idea (“chaste,” “preserved her essence,” “defy the lullaby of conformity”), creating minor loop drag. The figurative field is mostly coherent (silver, snow, threads, prism), though density stays high even at peak beats. Greater concision and a few concrete, tactile anchors under stress would boost propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clean syntax and pacing; sentences carry purpose without clutter. Recurrence of key phrases (“uncommonly serene,” “half‑lit epiphany,” “meteor hush”) risks loopiness and lightens impact. Telling intrudes in places, slightly flattening moments that could bear scene. Overall readable with moments of quiet beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.4)

The final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.8)
    Lush lines carry atmosphere, yet periodic purple drift and repetition dampen momentum. The “dato” typo and the sudden “无数次” insert feel like artifacts, breaking polish. Some adjacent sentence echoing and stock color imagery (“amethyst and indigo,” repeated “dusky harmony”) signal minor loops. Clarity holds, but elite‑tier crispness isn’t sustained at the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, image‑forward lines with purposeful diction and minimal scaffolding; the tactile listening detail is strong. There’s mild purple/therapy‑speak and a few direct metaphors that edge toward didactic. No major loops or cadence monotony; momentum is maintained. The final sentence pays off motif without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lyrical lines carry high information density and strong images (“butterfly of starlight and mathematics”), mostly coherent and not overmixed.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clear and image‑dense without collapsing into purple; sentence rhythm varies and carries momentum. A few conceptual repeats (“deciduous vows” phrasing, theme restatements) add slight scaffold. Figurative logic holds, and information density is good. Final images are clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is polished and often elegant, with strong image economy in places. However, motif repetition and near‑loops (“simply complicated,” “brightened disquiet,” “between the first and last page”) create slight drag. A touch of purple in stacked abstractions blunts urgency at the peak. Rhythm generally carries momentum despite these minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished, with strong verb choices and economical specificity; most sentences do multiple jobs. Occasional purple notes and repeated motifs nudge toward excess but don’t obscure clarity. Minimal scaffold or paraphrase loops; momentum is maintained through transitions. The final image ties cleanly to recurring objects and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery (“fog pressing like curious ghosts,” “spark waiting for fuel”). Figurative language rarely clots or contradicts itself, and sentences carry multiple loads (setting, mood, character). A few thematic tags repeat (“trapped freedom,” “blissfully aberrant”), but they don’t stall momentum. Line‑level clarity persists through the climax and final image.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is clean, economical, and image-forward (brass cogs, bronze chains, humming fibers). Minimal scaffolding, strong nouns and verbs, and purposeful detail density. A few explanatory lines could be tightened, but momentum holds and syntax varies. No figurative muddle at the climax.

Rhythm varies and images carry weight without figurative muddle. The final paragraph lands with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished and imagistically rich with strong nouns and purposeful verbs; key images carry multiple jobs (crystals as archive, forecourt as stage). Some redundancy (“preemptively nostalgic,” explicit restatements of purpose) and occasional tell‑scaffold slightly dilute momentum. Figurative control stays coherent; no muddled metaphors or cadence templates dominate. The final line lands cleanly without purple overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentence rhythm varies well, images are concrete, and lines often carry dual duty (world + character). A few phrases risk purple (“purple that sang,” “defy the gravity of hopelessness”), but they cohere to the tonal design. Minimal redundancy; action remains clear. The final cadence lands cleanly on image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.1)
    Clean sentences with an even flow, but notable redundancy (“texture of time,” “transition periods”) and some purple edging (cicada pulsing/glowing) slow momentum. Several adjacent lines paraphrase similar insights without adding pressure, creating mild loop fatigue. Figurative language is mostly coherent, yet density sometimes outweighs necessity. Tightening repetitions and trusting images would lift this considerably.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with strong image economy (porcelain doll, silver‑vined trellis, vessel). Occasional purple tendencies and phrase loops (“intangibly tangible,” stacked modifiers) lightly blur edge control but do not obscure action. Rhythm and syntax vary; momentum holds through the ascent to the trellis. Copy is clean and sequential logic clear.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, with purposeful repetition (whistle, hush, prisms) and good image economy.

Overall clean, with minimal scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clear and largely clean, with some evocative images. There’s minor redundancy and purple edging, plus repeated phrases that could be pared for propulsion. The final beats are readable but could carry more density and sharper verbs. No major artifacts, but momentum softens where compression could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line‑level craft is clean and rhythmic with purposeful imagery; mechanical errors are absent. Some purple tint and paraphrase tendencies (“eloquently silent” twice; declarative thematics) modestly slow momentum. Figurative density is mostly coherent, though a few lines tell what the images already show. Overall clarity and propulsion hold.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong line‑level craft with varied syntax and high information density; images often do double duty. A few ornate or redundant phrases (“factually mystical nature,” repeated intensifiers) flirt with overwriting but do not obscure action or closure. Momentum is steady; minimal scaffold. Final line recalls charged motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    Line-level craft is clear and largely efficient, with a few summary passages that slow momentum.

    Generally clean lines with purposeful imagery; momentum holds. Some redundancy and stock formulations (“luminous regret,” repeated “rain‑washed,” aphoristic closes) nudge toward overwriting. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat, but the final paragraphs court summary‑sounding moralization.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is polished with strong image economy (“hidden sunrise,” “misaligned harp,” “crystallizing laughter”). Minor purple notes repeat (“luminous ache”), but rhythm and clarity hold. Sentences generally multitask and propel. No loops or scaffold that blunt momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is largely taut and image‑driven, with good momentum and syntactic variety. Some repetition and density verge on overwriting (“ultraviolet” reiterations, stacked abstractions) and a few paraphrase echoes could be trimmed. The line “mercy was a function of time over pain” reads expository rather than imagistic. Still, clarity holds and the final image lands.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, with strong imagery and minimal mechanical error. Some redundancy (“elusively tangible,” “anchors of intuition,” “eternal instant”) risks echo without new pressure and edges into purple in the climax. Information density is generally good, but a few lines paraphrase prior sentiments. Final beats remain clear despite heightened lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)

Final cadence lands with precision and without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean and image‑forward, with a few abstract formulations and light redundancy that could tighten. Figurative language is generally apt and not muddled; the “tapestry of moments” metaphor is consistent. Momentum lulls slightly in explanatory sentences but recovers at key beats. Final line resolves with a concrete image tied to prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line‑level is polished and musical with strong image scaffolding, yet density occasionally veers purple and repeats concepts (“harmonizing discord,” “woven dawns,” “beauty in the incomplete”) without new pressure. Some sentences paraphrase adjacent content, softening propulsion. The final moralizing line dulls the closure image’s charge. Overall clarity is good, but trims would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry clean momentum with purposeful compression across months; images do more than one job. Minor repetition and summary cadences appear, but they don’t stall the final beat.

Tighter pruning could heighten pressure and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lines are generally clear and economical, with effective images (“sound of seeds hitting earth... a soft language of hope”). Some purple leaning and small redundancies dampen propulsion; the stray glitch “ttk duelersi” disrupts flow. The years-later summary compresses well but edges toward sentimental phrasing. Overall clean but not elite-precise.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, image‑rich, and economical; several lines do double duty with world and theme. Momentum holds despite summary passages. Some phrasing loops and explicit theme statements soften the edge, but no figurative muddle or scaffold obscures causality. The final image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and often vivid, but loops and purple pulls recur (multiple sentences restating isolation, duty, and hope). Several near-duplicate constructions dampen momentum. Figurative density rarely misfires, yet the uniform cadence reduces propulsion. Overall clarity holds, but tighter cuts would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean, fluent sentences with purposeful detail; minimal scaffolding and few redundancies. Occasionally generic modifiers (“otherworldly blue,” “impossible constellations”) and summary insights lower edge. The climax is clear on the line level with an effective final image. Prose could carry more torque under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines are largely polished with strong imagery and purposeful cadence, but metaphor density is high and certain phrases recur (“luminous absence,” “nomadic penumbra”), risking slight purple drag. Two bracketed Chinese “needs correction” notes are visible artifacts that break polish. Concision otherwise holds, with good multi-function sentences. Final image remains clear despite minor textual noise.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.6)
    Fluid sentences with strong sensory economy and recurring motifs; diction suits the mythic tone. Occasional purple tilt and summary patches soften momentum. Minimal scaffolding and clean mechanics. The final cadence is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level craft is clear and economical, with strong noun-verb choices and multi-tasking sentences. Minor redundancies (“unmistakably his own” twice) and a few near-abstract lines are present but do not stall momentum. Imagery is clean and varied; rhythm supports the quiet escalation. The final image feels earned without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    Language is polished with efficient imagery (“cobalt lighthouse,” “screaming tenderness”) and few redundancies. Minor repetition of phrasing and a handful of familiar notes (“protective aura”) don’t drag momentum. Sentences vary and carry multiple jobs. The final cadence is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Mostly clean, propulsive lines with effective image work; repetition sometimes drifts into scaffolding (restated moon fluctuation, reiterations of the cycle). One notable syntactic/grammar glitch dulls a peak beat’s clarity. Density remains good, but a light trim would heighten momentum and remove small redundancies. The final image lands despite these minor line-level debts.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, image‑forward, and largely efficient, with strong verbs and purposeful detail. Some phrases repeat or verge on familiar lyric shorthand (“fractured grace,” “broken and beautiful”), and modifier stacks appear but rarely clog momentum. Sentences do more than one job without heavy scaffolding. The final third remains clear and rhythmic despite a mild tendency to summarize insight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line‑level craft is controlled, with strong verb/noun choices and multi‑tasking sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lines are clean and grammatical, but abstraction and repetition create mild momentum drag. Figurative recurrence is purposeful yet occasionally feels over-insistent, with paraphrase loops (e.g., multiple formulations of unity/separation and inward/outward). Concrete, sensory anchoring is sparse, limiting propulsion. The final image is clear despite the lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clear, compressed, and image‑driven, with purposeful repetition in the counting run. A few redundancies and abstractions soften momentum, and the final truncated word (“The hydra”) reads as a copy error that mars polish at the exit. Figurative choices are largely coherent and anchored to physical specifics. Overall line craft is strong but not immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are generally clean and purposeful, with some strong images (“quiet wildfire,” mushrooms brightening in approval).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean and image‑dense with purposeful repetition, but it edges toward redundancy (“fractally precise,” “with willowglass hope,” “motivation to illuminate hidden pathways” recur without always adding pressure). Some sentences restate stakes rather than advance them. Rhythm is varied enough to maintain momentum, and figurative language stays coherent. Minor trimming could tighten the middle.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and clear with solid image economy (colors as emotion, rope creak, cool stone). Some paraphrase/reassertion (“translating the unknown,” “transitional object,” “chosen her”) creates mild redundancy and reduces charge. Explanatory scaffolding replaces dramatization at the peak. No serious figurative muddle, but momentum softens in summary lines.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and readable, with purposeful images (amber grains, miniature waterfalls). Some phrasing loops and redundancies soften momentum, and moralizing lines dull the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic with purposeful detail density. Some paraphrase/echo between lines (“polished calm,” repeated structures) introduces mild redundancy. Telling compresses events efficiently but blunts some immediacy at key beats. Final images are clear and unblurred by mixed metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are clean and readable with minimal scaffolding; information density is adequate for the length. Some phrasing trends toward repetition and abstraction (“understanding was dawning,” “midnight solace”), but not to the point of obscuring sense. Figurative language is restrained and coherent, though occasionally generic. Line‑level propulsion could tighten by cutting summaries that restate already‑shown beats.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean syntax and momentum; most lines carry multiple jobs (world, action, mood). Some redundancy (“warlike serenity,” “swirling orchard vortex”) and stacked modifiers edge toward overwriting without derailing clarity. Figurative patterning (circles, spirals) is coherent and paid off. A leaner final paragraph would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines often carry dual duty (image + action), and rhythm mostly breathes with the scene. Some overwriting and repetition (“anxious elation,” abstract labels like “the future had arrived early”) soften edge and create mild redundancy. Summary verbs (“realized,” “understood”) cluster near the climax, dulling impact. Overall clear, but could cut and sharpen for higher charge.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is often strong and image‑dense, but occasional redundancies (“inlaying meaning” recurs) and a noticeable typo (“укрепed”) nick polish. Figurative language runs lush without always adding new pressure, edging toward purple in places. Momentum generally holds, and syntax varies, yet small loops could be cut to sharpen force. Line‑level craft is good, short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines carry multiple jobs—setting, character, and theme—without excess scaffolding; prose is largely lean. Occasional heightened phrasing (“echo valley,” “after the applause” anaphora) borders on ornamental but remains purposeful. No notable loops or figurative muddle; syntax is clear with good momentum. The final image lands cleanly without overwritten flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)

Minor purple notes do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences are clean, varied, and image-forward, with good information density; repeating motifs (tide, creel, forge) carry multiple jobs. Occasional declarative explanation softens momentum and subtext (“The key to maintaining…”), and a few lines verge on summary. Imagery remains coherent; no metaphor muddle or cadence templating. Overall, polished and publishable with minor tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.9)
    Polished, image‑driven lines with good propulsion; most sentences do more than one job. Some repetition and elevated diction skate near purple, but coherence holds and momentum rarely sags. Minimal scaffolding; concrete verbs and charged nouns carry weight. A sharper cut of a few summarizing insights would elevate further.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is vivid and mostly lean, with images doing multiple jobs (graffiti as archive, the accordion as grief‑object). One proofreading glitch (“Her市政府 papers”) and a few on‑the‑nose lines slightly mar the polish. Repetition is purposeful rather than looped, and rhythm varies well through the descent. Momentum holds without scaffolding bloat.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished, image-rich, and generally economical; recurring objects do double duty (watch as time, lens, cipher key).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line‑level craft is dense and propulsive; images do double duty (fractures as both history and mechanism). Minimal scaffold and no evident loops; syntax varies to pace the ritual and climax. Figurative language is frequent but coherent to the cold/velvet/plant motif, staying clear at the ending beat. A slight richness overload in the opening could be trimmed, but momentum holds.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, luminous sentences with purposeful imagery and minimal syntactic clutter; strong verbs and specific nouns carry weight. Some repetition (“threshold,” “aurora,” “static”) edges toward lushness saturation, and a few paraphrase moves could be trimmed. Momentum is preserved despite lyric pace. The final cadence lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean sentences with serviceable rhythm; imagery is steady without mixing metaphors egregiously. Some repetition (“vineyard hush,” “kindly decisive,” “scallop”) skirts loopiness and a few declaratives tell what images already imply. Momentum holds despite occasional summary lines. Overall, polished but not razor‑tight.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.0)

Some phrases verge on purple or abstract (“altar of frozen tears,” “quiet dignity”), and a bit of paraphrase looping appears across adjacent sentences. Still, information density is decent and the final image lands crisply. No significant grammar or cadence artifacts impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, image‑rich, and efficiently patterned; objects do multi‑work (nets, whisk) and lines carry atmosphere and character. Minor overwriting and conceptual restatement appear in spots, with one explicit theme statement flattening subtlety. Rhythm and sentence variety generally serve momentum. No major artifacts or loops impede clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Clean sentences, good image economy, and a few strong tactile beats (“fingers growing raw”). Some redundancy and summary scaffolding flatten momentum, especially in explanatory stretches and the aphoristic close. Figurative language is restrained; no major muddle. Rhythm could vary more at pressure points to amplify urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean, well‑weighted sentences with good information density; images do double duty (cobalt glass as science and omen). Occasional repetition (“fragmented radio frequencies,” “ancient shadows”) is patterning rather than churn. Figurative language stays coherent and controlled; little scaffolding or hedging. It’s lush without tipping into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line-level craft is polished: strong verbs, purposeful imagery, and varied rhythms; most sentences do more than one job. Occasional purple tint (“theater of his solitary existence”) skirts ornament but doesn’t blur sense. Minimal scaffolding and loops; momentum is steady despite reflection. Closing image is clear and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lines are generally clean, vivid, and economical; strong verbs and tactile nouns carry weight. A few purple or familiar turns (“cracked like distant bones,” repeated “azure”) and occasional redundancy modestly dilute pressure. Figurative choices mostly cohere to sound/vibration; no damaging loops or cadence templates. Momentum holds through the climax and settles into a crisp final image.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean and image‑rich with good sensory layering (hum through basalt, lamp shadow, lake crack). Some redundancies and abstract assertions slow momentum in the final third. Figurative language is mostly coherent, with minimal purple drift. Information density is solid, though a tighter line edit could heighten propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is clean, economical, and layered—observations often do double duty (forensic and thematic). Minor telliness and a couple of echoing intensifiers (“reverberate”) slightly dull edge. No major loops or purple overload; sentences propel. Final cadence lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is largely clean, rhythmic, and sensorially precise; most sentences do multiple jobs. Occasional purple touches and reiterated phrases (“vibrant hush,” thematic aphorisms) add a slight glaze. Momentum holds, and images are coherent and legible. No significant loops or scaffolding slow the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are clear, economical, and image‑driven; momentum rarely stalls. Repetition of key terms (“yearning algorithm,” “steadily curious nature”) introduces mild loop feel without derailing clarity. Figurative texture is mostly coherent and earned; purple patches are limited. Final cadence is crisp and image‑resolved.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are generally propulsive and dense; exposition is integrated with momentum. There is some metaphor pile‑up and motif repetition (“ghosts,” “echo,” “songs”) that edges toward purple. Still, syntax varies, scaffolding is minimal, and the closure image is clear. The prose carries pressure without major artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush and mostly precise, with effective image systems (shadows, ice, mirrors) and clean mechanics. Occasional purple stacking and paraphrase loops (“weighted breath,” reiterations of empathy/action) slow momentum. Still, line-level clarity remains high during the climax and the closure image is crisp. A touch of pruning would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean and musical, with tactile images doing consistent work; the parasol tip and ice soundscapes are effective. That said, a few thematic restatements and near-duplicate beats (“windborne solace,” transformation lines) slightly slow momentum. Figurative control is mostly tight, with only minor drift into abstraction. Rhythm and clarity hold through the close.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Clean, readable lines with recurrent images doing thematic work. However, paraphrase loops and repeated stems (“After the final bus…,” “Drawing parallels…,” “amber pavilion…”) reduce momentum and density. Occasional platitudinal phrasing softens edge. Greater syntactic variety and pruning would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line‑level craft is clean and often musical; sentences carry atmosphere and information without obvious grammatical slips. There is some purple accumulation and phrasing loops that could be trimmed for propulsion, and a few conceptual reiterations dilute peak cadence. The final image lands cleanly despite these minor densities.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is clean and readable with evocative images, yet redundancy and mild telling recur (“essence of collective healing,” repeated vine and lavender beats). Some figurative choices land, others feel safe or generic. Momentum dips during summary assertions. Line-level craft is competent but not diamond-cut.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line work is often elegant, but phrase recurrence (“reticent scholar,” “suspended hush,” “weathered innocence”) and thesis reiterations create mild loop/overwriting drag. Most sentences do multiple jobs and maintain clarity. The closure image is clean, though a touch of purple repetition blunts its edge. Concision in a few places would sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, image-forward, and mostly economical; sentences carry multiple jobs. A slight repetition (“arranging driftwood as directional markers”) edges toward redundancy but also functions as motif. Figurative choices remain coherent; no purple stacks or mixed metaphors at the peak. The final cadence is earned and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong lines and imagery carry momentum, but there’s some overwriting and near-repetition (“luminous ache,” “ephemeral,” “changelessly constant”). Phrases like “leathered the boundaries” jar clarity. Overall density is good, yet trimming would sharpen force and reduce abstraction. No major scaffold loops, but the final explanations could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line craft is clean and purposeful, with strong nouns and recurring images doing double duty. Occasional elevated phrasing skirts sentimentality but remains grounded by concrete detail. Minimal repetition (“pulsing stillness”) reads as motif, not loop. Pacing and syntax support the quiet urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is clear and mostly economical, with vivid nouns (“clockwork automaton key,” “rune stones”) doing good work. There are mild repetition and scaffold phrases (“budding rune scholar,” “quietly deliberate,” reiterated stakes) and occasional tell‑leaning lines. Figurative language is controlled but safe; momentum holds. Final beats are clean but could use tighter, more charged syntax to heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong line work with high information density and vivid imagery; sentences carry multiple jobs without obvious scaffolding. A few near‑purple patches and repeated abstractions (“nostalgic innovation,” “shrewdly innocent”) create faint echo. Rhythm is varied and propulsive enough to sustain the scene. Mechanics are clean, with a precise final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is polished with good rhythmic variety and vivid concretes; lines often carry dual duty (image and theme). There’s mild redundancy (memories resurfacing, reaffirmations of purpose) and some adjective stacking that verges on purple in places. Momentum holds, with no major scaffold or template cadence. The final image is clear and unblurred by figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry layered work—image, theme, and motion—without stalling. Some repeat abstractions (“protected vulnerability,” “catalyst for change”) and near‑loops lightly dull peak density, but clarity holds. Figurative language stays coherent to the tech‑nature palette. The closing image is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    Polished sentences and strong images carry momentum, but there’s intermittent overwriting and phrase repetition that add drag. Abstract nouns and intensifiers recur (“essence,” “sacred,” “mysterious, ethereal folds”), reducing density. Redundancies (repeats of “lucidly watchful,” “against the current,” “ephemeral cameo appearances”) appear, including late. Despite this, the closure image reads cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished, image-rich, and largely efficient, with motifs (“verdant arbor,” “gathering hush,” “harvest moon”) doing thematic and structural work. Occasional purple touches are balanced by clarity and forward motion. Little scaffolding or looped paraphrase; syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat monotony. The final image lands cleanly without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is polished, image‑rich, and largely clear; sentences carry atmosphere and forward motion. Redundancies and scaffold stems (“This was…”) recur, and occasional purple intensifiers drift toward summary. Rhythm varies with acceptable control, though density could be trimmed at the peak for sharper propulsion. No major figurative muddle, but minor repetition slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean and lyrical, with purposeful repetition (“wounded season,” reflections) and varied syntax. Minor abstraction and motif reiteration risk slight purple hue, but clarity holds and momentum accrues. Information density is good; lines often do double duty (world + method). No significant loops or muddled metaphors in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, action, and thought—while maintaining clarity and rhythm. Figurative language is apt and not muddled; momentum sustains through the ritual. Some phrase repetition (“boundary‑lessly,” “orienting properly”) risks slight redundancy but functions as pattern. No major scaffolding or cadence artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is polished, sensory‑dense, and mostly efficient; images often carry multiple jobs. Occasional purplish lean and a minor redundancy do not swamp clarity. The “指纹” intrusion is a copy artifact that dents finish. Momentum holds, though a few lines state what images already imply.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry high information density and propel scene and image; repetition is mostly purposeful (eroded ambitions, fractured stillness/liquid peace). Figurative language is vivid and coherent to the world’s logic. A few abstractions (“magical power,” “profoundly chronologically confused”) skim telling, but they don’t blunt the closure image. Rhythm varies, and mechanics are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is clean and propulsive with selective imagery (“stars awakening”) and purposeful verbs. Minor redundancies and abstract restatements appear, especially around the motif phrases, but do not stall momentum. Information density is good; scaffolding is minimal. The final line resolves by image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line craft is polished, with multi‑tasking sentences that carry image, mood, and interiority. Minor redundancy (“crystal whispering forecourt after rain,” “excruciatingly gentle,” “glacial hush”) adds slight purple overtones and a small loop feel. Syntax and cadence vary, maintaining momentum through a quiet arc. No figurative muddle that harms clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    Line work is clean and rhythmic, with purposeful sensory detail. Some repetition and conceptual redundancy (“architecture of lies,” “silence of morning radio,” “serene upheaval”) add light drag. Figurative language generally coherent; little scaffolding. Momentum holds, but sentence‑level surprise is modest.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean lines, strong image economy, and minimal scaffolding; the prose advances atmosphere and action concurrently. There is some syntactic and phrasing repetition and a few near‑duplicate insights that could be trimmed. Figurative language is apt (muffling hush, lightning in sand) and not overwrought. Momentum holds across the quiet span.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are polished, sensorial, and largely economical; figurative language is coherent and purposeful. Minor repetition (“geography of healing,” “projection of presence”) slightly blunts freshness but doesn’t stall momentum. Sentence variety supports flow from hush to quickening. No mechanical or clarity errors.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clear, sensory, and mostly economical; many lines carry dual duty (world + emotion). A few abstractions and near‑repetitions (“bitter sweetness,” “hypothesized”) modestly slow momentum. Figurative language is controlled and coherent; no mixed metaphors at the climax. Closing cadence lands cleanly on a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, with strong verb choices and purposeful images tied to action. Some lines loop conceptually (coin/black sand/cloud migration restatements), and a few metaphors trend ornate. Momentum mostly holds through the high‑pressure beat with the embers. Minor purple glints soften edge rather than obscuring sense.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lines are vivid and purposeful, with strong image economy (moss arrows, stone throats, starlight key). There are a few artifacts—typo/foreign fragment (“的记忆”), awkward phrasing (“on unstick the memories”)—and occasional concept repetition that could be tightened. Figurative density stays coherent and mostly clear. Good propulsion with small copyedits needed for elite finish.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clean sentences with coherent flow and few mechanical issues; information density is decent. Refrains (“approximating infinity,” “across the quiet sigh of falling petals”) work but flirt with redundancy. Occasional purple lean does not blur sense, yet momentum dips with repeated abstractions. More concrete, consequential beats would sharpen propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.8)
    Highly image-forward prose with strong sensory economy and clean syntax. Occasional overwriting and a small typo (“Thecompleted”) nick polish, and some reiterations of calm/thunder verge on pattern echo. Most sentences do multiple jobs (setting, theme, character) without sludge. Momentum holds despite reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with vivid images (“pendulum bob glinted,” “obsidian ridge”), and momentum mostly holds. Some purple phrasing (“searing reverie,” “incremental absolution wove itself”) and repeated thematic terms dull edge slightly. No major loops or syntactic monotony, and information density is decent. A touch leaner and less abstract in key beats would sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is largely clean and evocative, with strong noun-verb choices and purposeful imagery (cobalt, velveteen, hum). There’s mild redundancy (reiterated mood tags; similar sentence structures) and a few purple-leaning modifiers that could be trimmed for tautness. Information density is good, and beats carry forward without scaffolding bloat. The final paragraphs maintain clarity and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is polished with strong images (“dark tooth,” iridescent quill), and the lines carry momentum. There are minor paraphrase/redundancy loops (reiterating “groundedly imaginative,” “seed innovation within a constraint”) and some tell‑leaning scaffolds. Figurative density is mostly coherent, not purple, and mechanics are clean. The final line is tidy rather than cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.4)

Some conceptual redundancy and telling dampen propulsion, and a few statements lean generic. Figurative language is contained and coherent; no purple sprawl or cadence templates dominate. The final image is crisp and unfussy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line‑level craft is clean, with concrete verbs and multisensory texture. Minor repetition of thematic phrasing and a slight register shift in the neuroscience line are the only notable blemishes. Sentences carry multiple jobs (action, image, theme) without drag. The final line lands clearly without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is clean with a few striking images (“nectar dusk”) and minimal scaffolding. Expository lines occasionally stack, but sentences generally do double duty and keep momentum. Little to no redundancy or figurative muddle in peak beats. A touch of purple is restrained and doesn’t obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lines are controlled and musical, with purposeful repetition and image economy. Occasional abstraction (“sanctify her understanding,” “inadvertently profound truth”) tendencies approach telling, but rhythm and specificity usually ground them. No major loops or scaffolding; momentum is steady. Minor purple edges do not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is clean, image-rich, and mostly precise; the coral/ampoule motifs carry multiple jobs. Minor paraphrase/idea loops and a tendency toward aphoristic statements in peak beats slow momentum. Figurative language generally coheres without mixed metaphors. Information density is good, though a touch of purple intrudes near the thematic pronouncements.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean and largely economical, with images doing double duty (dice as fate, flaw as key). Some repetition and scaffold (“balancedly daring,” “perpetual motion”) and a few sentiment-leaning lines reduce density. Syntax varies enough to keep momentum, and sequence is clear. No figurative muddle at the peak, though the language could risk more without purple drift.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lines are generally clean and image-dense with good verb choice; the read‑aloud rhythm varies and avoids template cadence. Minor paraphrase and thematic reiteration (“kindness across millennia,” “languages sleep”) create slight loopiness and a touch of purple at peaks. Information density is solid with limited scaffolding. The final third remains clear despite a tilt toward summary assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry layered jobs—atmosphere and action—without major loops; rhythm varies and closes on a charged image. Occasional purple pressure (“rosewater dread” recurrence) skirts excess but remains coherent. Figurative logic holds (green lens, thaw, hive-mind) and momentum stays intact. Minor density patches could be trimmed for even sharper propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean, rhythmic prose with purposeful image selection; action order is clear. Some paraphrase echoes and abstract phrasing (“latent radiance,” “beyond fate’s design”) recur without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is vivid and mostly efficient, with images doing layered work (clasp pulsing with heartbeat; luminance moving from room to veins). Some diction repeats (“repulsive allure,” “lingering luminance”) and aphoristic lines verge on purple, slightly dulling momentum. Syntax varies enough to avoid drumbeat; clarity remains strong through the climax. Minor overwriting keeps it short of elite polish.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line‑level craft is polished, with strong verbs and layered images doing double duty (music as meteorology). Minor redundancy and a few declarative abstractions slightly reduce density, but momentum holds. Figurative language is largely coherent and scene‑serving. Opening and closing images bracket the piece with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sentences are clean with purposeful rhythm, and key images carry weight.

Minor repetition (“sunwashed dread”) and summary phrasing dampen density. Still, the final lines align image and intent effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clear and largely efficient, with solid image economy and few scaffolds. Some thematic repetition (“noble lies,” final moral lines) edges toward summary and slightly blunts momentum. Syntax and paragraphing are varied enough to keep pace steady. Line-level craft is competent, not yet cutting.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean sentences with good propulsion; concrete verbs (kneelt, plunged, wrest) anchor lyricism. Some redundancy and elevated phrasing (“hushed blaze,” “interlaced absence”) edge toward over‑ornamentation, and a few summary lines could be leaner. The final “click” is crisp. Overall solid line‑level craft with minor lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.9)
    Clean mechanics and clear sequencing throughout. Some paraphrase/idea loops and motif reiterations slow momentum and verge on purple (“dappled…through water” echoes; repeated thesis tags). Information density could be higher if redundant claims were tightened; the final paragraph leans into summary. The last‑page moral line blunts the image‑led cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs and maintain momentum; imagery is lush but mostly precise and functional. Minor repetition of light imagery risks saturation yet remains coherent to the motif. Syntax varies and transitions are clean. No significant scaffold, loops, or figurative muddle at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    Lines are generally clear and propulsive, integrating action and image without clutter. Redundancy and phrasing loops recur (“unfiltered awakening,” “intangibly tangible,” restated purpose), trimming energy and risking purple edges. Information density is decent, but pressure beats could be tighter with fewer summary declarations. No major grammar or sequencing issues.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished with strong verbs and efficient image systems; lines often do multiple jobs. Occasional purple tint (“liquid night,” repeated “brilliant dimness”) and minor redundancies (trait reiteration) slightly slow momentum. Syntax varies and action order remains clear. The final cadence lands cleanly without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line‑level craft is clean with purposeful images and strong verbs; information density is good.

The final third remains clear and image‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is clean and mostly economical, with strong images (“moonlight pooled,” “storm‑worn parapet”). There’s some repetition of formulations (“uncommonly thoughtful,” “between apology and forgiveness,” the mantra), creating light loopiness. Figurative language is controlled and consistent; no muddled metaphors. A bit more verb‑driven specificity in peak beats could sharpen momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clean syntax and momentum with purposeful detail; sentences often do double duty. Some figurative repetition and stock phrasing dampen freshness, and a few lines paraphrase nearby ideas. Rhythm holds and clarity remains high. Tightening cliché zones would sharpen the line‑level shine.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.7)
    Imagery is often strong, but there’s occasional purple weight and minor errors (“that newspapers was”) and redundancies (“delicately robust,” “jaded wonder”). Some metaphor stacking (“water in my chest,” “shattered mirrors”) blurs momentum. Sentences often do double duty, yet tightening could heighten propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: high information density, varied rhythm, and purposeful figurative language. There’s mild ornamentation and repeated celestial imagery, but clarity holds and momentum doesn’t stall. No significant scaffold or loop artifacts. A touch more restraint at peak beats would further sharpen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lines are mostly clean and propulsive, with concrete images doing double duty. Some repetition and abstract phrasing slightly dilute density in the final third, but clarity remains. Figurative language is consistent; no muddled metaphors or cadence templates dominate. Minor redundancy aside, the prose supports momentum and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is mostly clean and propulsive, with images doing double duty (tears as map; ship as reliquary). Some purple drift and abstraction (“compassion that transcended the ages,” “profound sacrifice”) and a few near-repetitions soften the edge. Rhythm varies well across paragraphs; choreography stays legible. The final image is clear despite occasional high-register generalities.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose is clean and rhythmic, with strong images (black sand, pulsing vials). There is some paraphrase and thematic repetition without added pressure, and several abstract formulations dilute immediacy. Figurative language is mostly coherent and not overstacked. Momentum holds, albeit with mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, with good image economy and purposeful recurrence (quill holder, sundial, light/shadow). Minor phrasing loops and abstractions (“cradle of sparks,” “winking hush”) recur without always adding new pressure. No clarity breaks; momentum holds. A touch less ornament in peak beats would sharpen force.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong image economy (stones, ratios, aurora, dust) with mostly clear syntax and momentum. Minor redundancy and occasional abstract tellings (“world unraveling at its cosmic seams”) soften pressure. Figurative language is evocative without muddle, and rhythm varies well. No major artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line‑level craft is mostly clean with strong images, but figurative density is high (“verses on the walls,” “cartography of scars,” “storm‑kissed wonder,” “rarefied air”) and occasionally redundant. Some paraphrase echoes slightly slow momentum. Clarity survives; cadence works with the timer beats. Trimmed metaphors would sharpen pressure without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Syntax is varied and mostly propulsive; images are vivid without major muddle. Occasional purple inflections and abstract taglines (“dignified chaos,” “turn questions into destinations”) introduce mild redundancy and didactic tilt. Line-level clarity holds throughout with few scaffolds. The closing paragraph edges toward summary cadence but remains readable.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with few redundancies; images often do double duty (object, theme, action). Some repeated phrases and motifs verge on over‑insistence but don’t cloud clarity. Figurative language is rich yet mostly consistent; no mixed‑metaphor derailments. Momentum holds; sentences vary in cadence without scaffolding clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, mood, and plot—without bloating. A few repeated formulations (“surprise fate with an unplanned encore”) and expository lines about ancient texts slightly slow momentum but do not obscure causality. Imagery stays coherent and avoids mixed metaphors. Final beats read cleanly and land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is polished and musical with strong sensory density and mostly efficient lines.

== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but weakened by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. The same ideas—accumulated dust, gradual change, cosmic vs. terrestrial, decay and renewal—are restated in slightly different phrasing across multiple paragraphs. This repetition dulls the story's momentum and reads like an attempt to over-ensure the theme is understood.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from overwriting, relying on abstractions like "drifting resonance" and "scorched testament." It also employs clichés, such as a realization striking "with the force of a physical blow." While grammatically sound, the sentences lack propulsion, often prioritizing lyrical description over the momentum required for a thriller plotline, which dulls the impact of the final discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally clear but is hindered by significant repetition and scaffolding. The phrase "unshaken marvels" appears three times, and "The capsize survivor" is used as a recurring, clunky identifier. Several sentences paraphrase the content of the previous one, creating loops that slow momentum ("...contained not just tools, but hope—the hope that..."). This reduces information density and gives the piece a sluggish, over-explained quality.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it is weakened by repetition of key phrases that feel like prompt artifacts ("give rest a permanent address," "chased stillness," "impossible spaces"). This repetition, combined with some summary-heavy sentences in the resolution, creates a sense of scaffolding that dulls the impact of an otherwise poetic ending. The line-level craft is strong, but these conceptual loops prevent it from achieving true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally avoids clutter. However, there are instances of scaffold-like phrasing and conceptual repetition that dull momentum. The direct restatement of the "intergenerational support" concept from narration into Elias's final speech constitutes a story-level paraphrase loop, making the dialogue feel more like a thesis statement than an organic declaration under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. Sentences are generally well-crafted and purposeful. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward abstract or overwrought phrases ("foggy lucidity," "pilgrim of sparks") that, while thematic, can feel like labels rather than emergent qualities, momentarily flattening the texture.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, clear, and carries the story's momentum effectively. However, it suffers from a mild overuse of abstract terminology and a few repeated phrases ("quaking reverie," "fading photographs") that border on becoming crutches. The sentence "merging with her in a way that defied explanation" is a minor instance of telling, slightly weakening an otherwise strong moment.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from minor overwriting and repetition, such as the repeated use of "staggering grace." The final paragraph's shift into pure summary significantly stalls the narrative momentum built during the escape, ending the story on a moment of telling rather than a final, impactful image shown in-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. The rhythm and sentence structure effectively build atmosphere. The primary flaw is a loss of momentum in the final two paragraphs, which shift into summary and reduce propulsion. Additionally, the near-verbatim repetition of the "battered marvel" line functions as a paraphrase loop that feels more like a thematic signpost than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong, varied rhythm. The information density is high, with most sentences serving multiple functions. The score is slightly tempered by a tendency toward overwriting; the density of figurative language is consistently high, and the repetition of the key phrase "luminous disbelief" stands out as a minor prose artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose contains lovely phrases, it is marred by repetitive scaffolding. The full phrases "contemplative glassblower" and "abandoned control room" are reused like tags, and the construction "Outside, during ice melting..." is repeated almost verbatim, creating a prose loop. These artifacts, along with sentences that summarize what has just been shown, weigh down the story's momentum and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from a reliance on abstract conceptual nouns and clichés ("transformative betrayal," "fabricated life," "unstoppable power of absolute truth"). Several sentences state an emotional or thematic summary instead of grounding the moment in concrete action or sensation. While rhythmically competent, the line-level craft often chooses telling over showing, particularly when articulating the story's core ideas, which dulls the immediacy of the high-stakes scene.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose is hampered by noticeable artifacts. There is repetitive scaffolding in the reuse of key phrases like "ambered hush," "marbled hush," and "flaking gold leaf booklet," which feels slightly mechanical. Some phrasing, like "summarizing silence—reading the spaces between words," creates a paraphrase loop that reduces momentum. These tics prevent the prose from being truly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it occasionally relies on abstract labels that dull its immediacy, such as "existential processors" and "mystical moment of self-discovery." There is also some conceptual redundancy in the final third, with phrases like "merged into a singular consciousness" and "integrating fragments from across time" restating the same idea in adjacent beats. These minor scaffolding artifacts slightly slow the momentum of an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose begins with evocative, sensory language but shifts towards more functional, explanatory sentences in the second half. Pivotal moments of realization are often told rather than shown ("She understood now that...", "she realized the power she held..."). This tendency toward summary, especially in the conclusion, flattens the prose and stalls the momentum built by the stronger opening.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and largely concise, with high information density in its imagery. The sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, creating a compelling narrative flow. The primary weakness is a tendency toward conceptual paraphrase, especially in the final paragraph, which lists abstract dualities ("wild yet ordered, scientific yet magical") instead of trusting the concrete images to do the work, slightly dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from a significant number of text artifacts in the form of looped key phrases. The repetition of terms like "mechanically warm" (4 times) and "magnetic nexus at twilight" (4 times) goes beyond motif into mechanical redundancy. This core flaw drains the language of specificity and momentum, particularly in the story's final third.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it is hampered by occasional overwriting and repetitive structures. Several sentences rely on stacked binaries ("hauntingly familiar yet utterly alien," "ancient and new") that feel more like conceptual placeholders than precise descriptions. A few passages fall into a template cadence ("flickering lanterns casting dancing shadows," "keys gleaming in the lantern light") that slightly dulls the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery like "subcutaneous map drawn not in ink but in sorrow." Momentum is well-maintained. A minor flaw is that some of the high-concept exposition, while intriguing, is delivered in dense sentences that feel more like authorial explanation than character-filtered thought, briefly breaking the narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and propulsive for the most part. However, the final two paragraphs contain some summary and scaffolding that could have been rendered through image ("he realized he'd found what he came for... an understanding that..."). This tendency to summarize the emotional and thematic takeaway in the final beats slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with strong sensory details and well-crafted figurative language ("sinking through solidified honey, reality sliding past like cold silk"). Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm. While a few phrases lean toward familiar constructions ("like ink on wet parchment"), the overall execution is highly polished, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or artifacts to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clear, clean, and possesses a gentle rhythm that suits the story's tone. Sentences are well-constructed and the narrative momentum is steady. The writing occasionally dips into soft, somewhat generic descriptions ("sanctuary of sound," "symphony of healing") and sentimental abstractions, which prevent the line-level craft from achieving exceptional sharpness or density.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often lyrical and evocative ("silence had taken on a bronze quality"), it is significantly hampered by text-artifact issues. There are numerous instances of paraphrase loops and template cadence, with many paragraphs starting with variations of "The odd historian..." or "The bronze quiet...". This repetition measurably dulls momentum and gives the story a formulaic structure at the line level, preventing the prose from achieving its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and contains some evocative phrasing. However, its momentum is hindered by conceptual paraphrase loops, where adjacent sentences or paragraphs restate the central theme of "open secrets" or the writer's motivation in slightly different terms. This repetition acts as scaffolding, telling the reader what to think rather than allowing meaning to emerge through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but is hampered by a reliance on abstract nouns and some clunky phrasing ("The muffled clarity of his approach confused the being"). The repetition of "The unraveled stillness of the sanctuary" is a prose loop that dulls its own impact. These elements create a conceptual density that occasionally hinders the story's momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, with elegant phrasing and a strong rhythmic sense. However, the final two paragraphs devolve into summary, breaking from the "show, don't tell" principle established earlier. This scaffolding ("The cryptic messages... now danced invisibly," "In that glass spire... time had folded...") explains the climax's meaning instead of letting the image of the collapsed conductor resonate on its own, dulling the story's final, crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and propulsive, with clear syntax. However, there are moments of telling over showing that slightly dull the immediacy, such as "The darkening brightness matched his emotional state." Some conceptual statements, like "The labyrinth wasn't external but within," read more like authorial summary than a character's raw thought process, momentarily flattening the texture of the prose at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear and concise, with strong central images like the "filament of hush." The primary weakness is a recurring use of summary and paraphrase loops in the story's second half. Sentences like "Eleanor's journey to defeat emotional numbness had led her to discover a new kind of music" merely restate what the preceding action has already dramatized, slowing momentum and dulling the impact of the otherwise powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is burdened by significant conceptual loops and redundant phrasing. The story frequently explains the same plot point in slightly different ways (e.g., how Elias pieced the conspiracy together), which stalls momentum. This pattern of telling and re-telling gives the piece a sluggish, scaffold-heavy quality that undermines its narrative tension.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it suffers from a tendency to summarize emotional and thematic developments, especially near the end. The sentence, "The transformation completing now wasn't just that of the rare orchid...it was Elias himself," is a prime example of telling the reader the character arc instead of letting the final action demonstrate it. This scaffolding weakens the story's propulsive clarity by prioritizing explanation over dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, but it suffers from minor but persistent scaffolding and redundancy. Phrases are occasionally looped for emphasis rather than advancement, such as describing the pattern's intuitive nature in two consecutive paragraphs. The use of abstract adjectival phrases like "ethically playful" or "passionate subtlety" functions as authorial telling that slightly dulls the line-level precision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose is clean and generally clear, but it tends toward summary and abstraction at key moments, such as describing the final musical performance. There is some repetitive phrasing ("acoustically perceptive nature/ears/fingers") that feels like a scaffold. The final paragraphs shift into telling mode, explaining the theme and Kael’s purpose, which drains momentum from the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it is hampered by a tendency toward telling and redundancy. Several adjacent sentences restate the same information in different words, creating paraphrase-loops that slow momentum. The reliance on abstract nouns to convey emotional states and motivations makes the prose feel less immediate and more summary-like than is ideal for high-level literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean but drifts into abstract, conceptual language that dulls emotional impact, particularly in the story's second half. Phrases like "historical contributory cycles" and "growing economy of mutual care" read like academic labels rather than lived experience. The final paragraph exchanges concrete imagery for abstract summary, telling the reader what to feel instead of showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose contains a catastrophic, immersion-breaking artifact: the phrase "沟通推进" appears nonsensically in the middle of a sentence, suggesting a flawed drafting or translation process that would require immediate rejection. Beyond this critical error, the prose occasionally relies on abstract summaries ("boldly sympathetic regard") and overwrought phrasing that slows momentum. This single error is disqualifying for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive, but it is weakened by several artifacts. There are moments of direct exposition that stall momentum, such as "recognizing this as the place where echoes are born." More significantly, the resolution contains a clear paraphrase loop: "Water flowed smoothly again... their interrupted cadence restored to its natural rhythm," which dulls the impact of the climactic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it occasionally relies on summarizing phrases that dull immediacy, such as "Elara realized she was on the verge of understanding something fundamental." There is also a slight repetition in phrasing—"gently inventive" and "after the orchard grew silent beneath the moon" appear twice—which feels more like a minor echo than a powerful, reweighted motif. These small frictions prevent the prose from achieving flawless momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, the story suffers from a prominent paraphrase loop, stating the core motivation in nearly identical terms at the beginning and the end. While much of the language is precise ("ferromagnetic tape reel fragment," "sapphire hush"), this conceptual redundancy slightly dulls the propulsion and impact of the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clear and grammatically sound, but it suffers from a lack of momentum due to its reliance on narrative summary. Sentences like "Weeks passed in a blur of data collection" and "The transformation was both reluctant and profound" compress pivotal developments into telling, which keeps the reader at a distance from the emotional core of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often evocative and precise, with strong imagery in the first half (“restless oceans and fragmented memories”). Momentum is slightly undercut by a reliance on summary in the final third, telling the reader about her transformation rather than showing it. Phrases like "labyrinthine corridors of her own trauma" and "profound responsibility settle in her bones" lean toward cliché, softening the impact of an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is marked by several instances of conceptual looping and scaffolding. Phrases like "steadily unpredictable" and the framing "The clairvoyant who... hadn't seen it coming" are repeated, which feels heavy-handed. Several adjacent sentences in the final third restate the same realization, slightly dulling the momentum of the otherwise powerful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from a recurring reliance on abstract, conceptual language and summary over dramatization ("navigated absences had become her specialty," "creating maps of what had been lost"). These moments of telling function as scaffolding that slows momentum and slightly distances the reader from the immediate experience. While the line-level craft is generally clean, this tendency towards abstraction prevents it from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is marred by text artifacts. The label "analytically artistic mind" is repeated three times, and the phrase "trembling certainty" appears twice, creating a noticeable loop. These repetitions function as scaffolding, telling the reader what to feel or think instead of letting the scene do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from severe conceptual looping and template-like repetition, which critically harms its quality. Phrases like "courageously kind," "unheard symphony," and "through forgotten patterns" are recycled verbatim multiple times, creating a scaffold-like structure instead of organic prose. This patterned artifact measurably dulls momentum and gives the story a formulaic feel, overriding its otherwise clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it leans on abstraction and summary in crucial moments, particularly the resolution. Phrases like "renewed determination" and "newfound purpose" tell the reader about the change instead of showing it through a final, concrete image or action. This tendency to summarize dulls the impact of the otherwise solid sentence-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and generally effective, avoiding major errors. However, it occasionally leans on abstractions ("liquefy rigid thinking," "liquid thoughts") and thematic summary where concrete action would be stronger. There are no significant prose artifacts, but the piece lacks the high information density and sentence-level propulsion of top-tier writing.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific, evocative imagery. The rhythm is controlled and supports the contemplative mood. There are, however, minor instances of conceptual redundancy and scaffolding, where adjacent sentences restate a core idea (like his belief system) in slightly different terms. These moments momentarily slow the otherwise excellent momentum and information density.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and a varied sentence structure that creates a compelling rhythm. The story suffers from some minor conceptual looping; the idea of "layering" stories to rebuild the self is restated multiple times in similar terms ("rebuilding myself story by story," "another sheet in my layered self," "layer the collected narratives"). While thematically central, this repetition creates slight drag rather than continuous forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear and functional, but the final third becomes overly expository and repetitive. The last few paragraphs summarize the thematic conclusion instead of letting the final actions and images carry the weight, creating a paraphrase loop at a conceptual level. This significantly dulls the impact of the closure, making the ending feel more like an analysis than a resonant moment.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose is clean but overly reliant on abstract concepts and summary. The final paragraphs exhibit significant conceptual looping, restating the same thematic points about resistance, encoding, and adaptation multiple times with slightly different phrasing. This redundancy stalls momentum and overwrites the story's conclusion rather than letting an image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clear but suffers from severe "template-cadence" issues and paraphrase loops, which significantly drag down the craft quality. The constant repetition of entire phrases ("dawning hush," "dawnlit melancholy," "moonlit summit") makes the writing feel programmatic and overwrought. While grammatically sound, the lack of sentence variety and the reliance on this small pool of descriptors dull the momentum and prevent the story from achieving the high level of polish required for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative but is hampered by moments of overwriting and abstract summary. Phrases like "ethereal silence" and "vulnerable nerves" feel slightly purple. More significantly, a sentence like "The motivation behind his work always extended beyond mere repair itself..." functions as a scaffold, telling the reader the theme instead of letting the action show it, thereby momentarily halting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in its descriptions of the environment. Sentences are generally well-constructed and propel the narrative forward. The score is held back by minor but noticeable slips into cliché ("magnificent bird," "scholarly heart") and the thematic over-explanation which functions as a line-level flaw, choosing to tell rather than to resonate through image.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong verbs and concrete imagery ("cracks spiderwebbing backwards into wholeness"). However, there are minor instances of repetition that could be tightened; the phrase "infinitely patient" appears twice, and "wild hush" is used as a refrain that borders on overuse. While the rhythm is generally effective, some passages fall into a similar sentence structure ("He took another step... Another strike..."), a subtle template cadence that slightly dulls the propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong images like "bubbles dancing like captured stars." However, momentum is occasionally slowed by overwriting and the use of familiar descriptors ("trembling fingers," "grinding finality," "crushing finality"). The repetition of the key phrase "lonesome splendor" feels like a minor loop rather than an intentional reinforcement, slightly dulling its impact on the second use.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often elegant, it suffers significantly from a reliance on template cadence. Nearly every paragraph begins with one of a handful of recurring phrases ("In the lighthouse prison...", "He would hover at...", "Through the scuffs on..."). This structural repetition, while thematically relevant, functions as a prose artifact that undercuts momentum and feels mechanical after several iterations, warranting a significant deduction per the rubric's specific "template-cadence check."

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with lush descriptions that build a potent atmosphere. However, certain key phrases like "lovingly venomous" and "resonant awakenings" are repeated, which slightly dilutes their impact and feels like a minor authorial tic. The final paragraph functions as a conceptual loop, restating themes that were already dramatized, which flattens the momentum of an otherwise sharp ending.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, but it is weakened by a recurring pattern of thematic labels and near-paraphrasing. Phrases like "ruin into reverence," "orchid solace," and "overlapping paths" are repeated to the point of becoming incantations rather than fresh descriptions. This creates a slight scaffold-like feel, where the prose states its intentions rather than letting the imagery do all the work, dulling the momentum in later paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong opening imagery. However, there are instances of abstraction and summary where concrete action would be stronger ("the renewal of purpose and connection"). The final paragraphs contain several paraphrase loops, restating the theme of completed journeys, which dulls the impact and momentum of an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, with a controlled rhythm and varied sentence structures. However, momentum is slightly dampened by minor scaffolding and paraphrase loops, particularly in the reflective passages. Sentences like "she had begun to understand that her craft allowed her to discover meaning" followed by "Each pseudonym was a celebration of identity's fluidity" restate the same core realization without sufficient new pressure, creating a slight drag where propulsion is needed most.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, a few sentences rely on summary rather than dramatization, slightly reducing momentum ("Her true motivation, however, was never to create merely decorative maps..."). While the figurative language is mostly effective, there's a slight tendency towards overwriting in the opening paragraph that momentarily pulls focus from the action.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is atmospheric and rhythmic, but it is weakened by several prose artifacts. There are instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent clauses restate the same idea ("not the apology she had been seeking, not the explanation she craved"). The final paragraphs shift from showing to telling, summarizing the story's resolution and thematic meaning, which stalls the momentum at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, but it occasionally tips into overwriting with a density of figurative language that feels slightly forced ("lotus-hearted ache," "weep mist," "curtain of twilight"). Some sentences restate concepts just established, creating minor paraphrase loops that slow momentum, such as the multiple descriptions of his work's purpose. These moments of stylistic excess slightly dull the otherwise sharp and affecting line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, often beautiful, and demonstrates strong control. However, the final two paragraphs slip into summary and scaffolding, explaining the story's outcome instead of allowing the final images to resonate on their own. Phrases like "had fulfilled her motivation" and "had developed into a future" are retrospective and dilute the immediacy of the otherwise powerful conclusion, reading like an authorial debrief.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic, but it often leans on abstract language to convey profound experiences ("perceived layers of reality simultaneously," "eternal pattern within the garden's acoustic architecture"). This tendency to summarize the transcendent rather than grounding it in specific, visceral sensory detail keeps the reader at a slight remove. While there are no major technical flaws, the information density is sometimes diluted by this conceptual phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and concise, but suffers from a critical redundancy near the end. The phrase "The converging chaos of their methods" is used twice in close succession, functioning as a thematic summary that dulls the momentum heading into the final image. This loop, combined with a tendency toward expository sentence structures, prevents the line-level craft from achieving a sense of propulsive elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, but it frequently tips into being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel stacked. There are minor but noticeable artifacts, such as the triple repetition of "shyly unstoppable" and the refrain-like use of "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind." While a stylistic choice, this repetition slightly dulls the propulsion and feels more like a scaffold than an organic element by the end.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong rhythm and clarity. However, there are moments of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly too ornate, such as "foxglove regret" or "tears that felt like tiny glass orchids unfurling in their heart." These moments, while beautiful in isolation, create a density that can feel precious. The inclusion of "遗忘 (forgetting)" feels like a slightly self-conscious gesture that momentarily breaks the immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is undermined by severe repetition and text-artifact loops. Key phrases ("symphonies of truth," "interconnected promises," "carefully reckless," "glass ink well," "unsnarl") are recycled throughout the text, creating a monotonous rhythm and reducing momentum. This looping feels mechanical, as if adhering to a checklist, and significantly dulls the impact of what is otherwise a clear narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but is significantly hampered by repetitive phrasing and thematic keyword loops. Phrases like "dappled resolve" and "encrypted compassion" are used multiple times, creating a text-artifact pattern that dulls momentum and feels programmatic. This synonym churn and conceptual redundancy across paragraphs prevent the prose from achieving the clean, propulsive quality required at the highest level, despite some otherwise evocative descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose demonstrates rhythmic control but is hampered by moments of overwriting and figurative language that verges on cliché ("stubborn dust motes refusing to be swept away"). There are minor redundancies ("invisible paths that only she could see") and a recurring, slightly forced "blooming/withering" motif. These line-level issues create minor drag and slightly blunt the impact of an otherwise clear and propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and a varied sentence rhythm. There is, however, a minor but noticeable repetition of key phrases ("featherly determination," "fractured hush," "necessary distances") which, while stylistic, slightly reduces the information density and feels like a faint prose artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and generally precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. However, the piece suffers from a few recurring prose artifacts, most notably the repetition of "softly ingenious" three times. This loop, while tied to a required element, reads as a scaffold or authorial tic rather than an intentional, evolving motif, slightly dulling the line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is significantly hampered by repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops that stall momentum. The sentence "Some paths disappeared without warning..." is repeated nearly verbatim, and key phrases like "cheerful gloom" and "before memory fades" recur to the point of diminishing returns. This textual artifact, particularly the direct sentence repetition, creates a sense of scaffold rather than earned motif, dulling the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean but relies on repeating abstract conceptual phrases as scaffolding. The reveal of Leo's deductions is delivered in a single summary sentence ("his analysis of her...had all been correct"), a crucial moment of telling that breaks momentum where showing was required.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm ("obsidian grace," "luminous ink"). The primary weakness is at the very end, where the final paragraphs engage in narrative summary, creating a paraphrase loop that restates the events and their meaning. This repetition slightly dulls the momentum and impact of the otherwise powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is often elegant but suffers from significant issues in the final paragraphs. It lapses into summary and paraphrase-loops, repeatedly explaining the meaning of the epiphany ("She understood now...", "The mysterious prism atrium... was a metaphor...", "The patterns in the pond had revealed..."). This scaffolding and conceptual redundancy dulls the impact of the closure, telling the reader what to feel instead of letting the images do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains strong, evocative images, but is hampered by moments of overwriting and conceptual redundancy. There is a recurring pattern of stating an abstract idea ("bargained innocence") immediately after a concrete image, which feels like scaffolding. Some phrasing loops occur ("slow dance," "unhurried movement," "slow...turn"), slightly dulling the momentum of an otherwise carefully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, but it leans heavily on abstract conceptual language ("fabric of possibility," "winds of potential futures," "serene upheaval"). This high density of abstraction, combined with some conceptual repetition (restating the "logical dreamer" idea), creates moments where the prose feels slightly overwritten and less grounded. The rhythm and clarity are generally strong, but concision could be improved by grounding more of the concepts in concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is largely clear, concise, and effective, with strong imagery in the first half. The primary flaw is the introduction of conceptual and paraphrase loops in the final paragraphs. Sentences like "she recognized the weight of this knowledge" and "she carried the weight of legacy's burden" restate the same idea, dulling the impact of the closure. This redundancy replaces the momentum of discovery with static summary, preventing the prose from landing its final, crucial beats with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is largely elegant and rhythmic, but the momentum is slightly impeded by redundancy. The story explains the nature of the "coded lullabies" twice—once in action and again in a later reflective paragraph. This paraphrase-loop feels like authorial scaffolding to ensure comprehension, momentarily breaking the otherwise seamless flow and high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative ("trust as fragile as terracotta"). However, it is marred by several instances of boilerplate phrasing and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "history being written and rewritten," "victory both complete and incomplete," and "flawed, painful, beautiful complexity" feel like scaffolding that dulls the specificity of an otherwise strong piece, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative for the majority of the story, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. The language effectively builds the atmosphere of "fractured grace." The score is slightly capped by the thematic statements near the end, where the prose shifts from sharp, imagistic storytelling to more abstract, less propulsive summary, momentarily dulling the line-level craft in a critical section.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but hampered by repetition that borders on scaffolding. Key phrases are reused to the point of diminishing returns, and there are clear paraphrase loops ("preserved not merely her body but her essence" is later restated almost identically). While perhaps intended as a lyrical refrain, this redundancy ultimately slows momentum and feels overwritten in critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose suffers from severe and pervasive text-looping artifacts. More than half a dozen key phrases are repeated three to six times each, often in close proximity. This creates a monotonous, incantatory rhythm that stalls momentum and reads like unedited generative output. While individual sentences may be clean, the overall texture is one of redundancy, severely damaging clarity and propulsion and making the piece unpublishable without a drastic line-level revision.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery creating a palpable atmosphere. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful. The score is held back by a few minor instances of redundancy where a sentence explains the symbolism of an object or action that is already clear, such as the line explaining the moth wing's similarity to the histories Aris preserves, which momentarily slows the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise for the most part, creating a strong sense of atmosphere with excellent rhythm. The language is controlled and purposeful. Minor flaws include a slightly clichéd description of the light's intensification ("glow softly, then pulse with increasing intensity") and a few sentences in the conclusion that summarize what was just dramatized, slightly reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, with a deliberate rhythm that supports the story's contemplative mood. Momentum is well-maintained. A weakness lies in a tendency toward abstraction, particularly when describing the final breakthrough. Lines like "a trinity of perception" are conceptual summaries rather than concrete, sensory experiences, and the "tiny spirits" metaphor in the final paragraph introduces a touch of sentimentality that clashes with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=3.5)
    The prose is generally elegant but is catastrophically marred by an unedited artifact: the Chinese characters "无数次" appear mid-sentence, completely shattering immersion and signaling a critical lack of polish. This is an instant-rejection flaw. Additionally, the story suffers from minor thematic scaffolding and a typo ("dato"), further detracting from an otherwise strong piece. The core failure is simply disqualifying for a professional publication.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it relies heavily on abstract nouns and occasionally overwrought phrasing ("metallic despair"). A significant flaw is the tendency to tell the reader crucial information that should be shown, most notably in the line stating Elara's motivation, which reads like authorial scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and precise, with strong imagery like "shattered like a failed constellation" and "glass mountains." However, the final paragraph shifts into summary, breaking the "show, don't tell" principle and weakening the climax's momentum ("His workshop became a gathering place..."). Additionally, there is some conceptual redundancy, with the idea of "erasing boundaries" being restated in multiple ways, which slightly dulls its impact through repetition rather than development.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong sentence-level craft. However, momentum is occasionally slowed by phrases that summarize intent rather than letting the action speak for itself (e.g., "a physical manifestation of her longing to reconnect"). These moments of authorial scaffolding, while infrequent, slightly dull the immediacy of key beats by explaining what the powerful imagery has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose is burdened by significant textual artifacts that blunt its effectiveness. Key conceptual phrases—"simply complicated," "brightened disquiet," "nonlinear inheritance"—are repeated to the point of becoming rote labels rather than resonant motifs. This mechanical repetition, combined with awkward phrasing like the redundant "breakthroughs in bathrooms," creates distracting loops that detract from the story's momentum and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it occasionally slips into overwriting with dense, abstract concepts ("cosmic order of knowledge," "unheard symphony of motion and meaning"). There is a reliance on telling over showing, particularly in the final two paragraphs which summarize the resolution and theme. The final sentence, "The unheard symphony of learning played on...", feels like a stock, sentimental closing rather than a sharp, resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is evocative but weakened by repetitive, high-concept phrasing ("blissfully aberrant," "unkindled solace," "narrative threads"). These keywords appear multiple times, creating a template-like cadence that feels less organic and more like an adherence to external prompts. This verbal tic dulls the momentum and specificity of otherwise strong descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and functional but is weakened by occasional redundancy and paraphrase loops that slow the momentum. For instance, the motivation is stated and then immediately restated in slightly different terms multiple times. This narrative scaffolding feels unnecessary and undercuts the otherwise competent descriptions, creating a sense of being guided by the author rather than immersed in the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery like "bloom of hush." The sentence-level craft creates a consistent, flowing rhythm appropriate for the story's tone. A handful of phrases lean on familiar fantasy constructions, slightly diluting the otherwise high level of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative for the most part, but it is hampered by abstract, summary-like sentences at key moments. Phrases such as "The collapse of civilization had not been an end but a transformation" feel more like authorial commentary than a character's immediate experience. This tendency to summarize pivotal realizations slightly dulls the story's momentum and immediacy, especially near the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with evocative imagery like "memories dripping like the rain." However, there are minor lapses into telling, such as "Elthion felt his purpose crystallize with sudden clarity," which summarizes a key internal beat. Some brief expository sentences explaining the world's rules also slightly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmic, with many striking images ("purple that sang"). However, a few generic phrases ("illuminated his determined features") and abstract labels ("defied explanation") slightly dull the otherwise sharp specificity. The moment of discovery with the mosaic relies on telling what the note says rather than showing the process of deciphering it, a minor lapse in an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally graceful but hampered by significant conceptual redundancy. The key phrase "the texture of time" is repeated five times, and the central insight about "transition periods" is paraphrased multiple times across different paragraphs. This looping creates verbal drag and dulls the impact of the epiphany, making the prose less efficient than its evocative imagery would otherwise allow.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, for a top-tier publication, it is held back by several instances of paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy that slightly dull momentum. Phrases like "intangibly tangible quality, something that could be felt in the soul but never truly captured" restate an idea rather than deepening it, an artifact that prevents the prose from reaching the highest echelon of concision and density.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean but weakened by noticeable repetition. The phrases "fluidly logical," "vaulting hush," and "monitoring noise levels" are used multiple times, reading like scaffolding or prompt echoes rather than organic word choices. This loop-like quality, particularly the reuse of "fluidly logical," creates a template cadence that detracts from the otherwise lyrical quality of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound but tends toward overwriting with stacked adjectives and adverbs ("wisely adventurous," "shimmering curtain of light and prismatic water"). This density can slow momentum rather than enhance it. The final paragraph shifts into summary, telling the reader Elara's emotional state ("wisely accepting") rather than showing it through a final, resonant action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong, evocative imagery. The rhythm is generally well-controlled, though the three consecutive "With the..." sentences at the climax create a stylistic flourish that slightly disrupts momentum. There are minor instances of near-redundancy ("the solitude she believed she craved, the emptiness she thought might bring peace") that could be sharpened for greater concision.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and propulsive, but it's hampered by moments of overwriting and repetition. The phrase "shadowseam wonder" is used twice, and the motivation is restated in similar terms multiple times, creating minor paraphrase loops. The final sentences summarize what has just been shown, adding unnecessary scaffolding that dulls the impact of the climactic image.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose has evocative moments, it suffers from significant conceptual looping and repetition that dulls its momentum. Key phrases like "eloquently silent," "golden shadows," and "the first yawn of evening" are repeated to the point of becoming noticeable artifacts. This redundancy, particularly the restatement of the "bridge of intuition" concept, reduces information density and feels like scaffolding rather than propulsive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("Dust rose like tiny spirits"). However, there are minor repetitive artifacts that dull the impact slightly. The phrase "factually mystical nature" is used twice, functioning as a label rather than letting the description do the work. This small redundancy prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier of flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean and concise, with strong momentum through the discovery phase. A notable flaw appears in the final two sentences, which form a paraphrase loop, restating the same thematic conclusion in slightly different terms. This repetition dulls the impact of the final image and reads like authorial scaffolding left in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose contains evocative imagery, such as the sky painted in "bruised purples and oranges" and the "auric lagoon." However, it is hampered by a tendency to tell rather than show, with phrases like "Working with practiced efficiency born from countless preparations." The final paragraphs become overly abstract, relying on conceptual nouns ("tyranny of indifference," "coded freedom") that dilute the story's momentum and sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it suffers from a notable pattern of lexical looping with the story's key terms ("vested hush," "quietly vivid," "eerie nostalgia"). This repetition functions as a prose artifact that dulls the momentum and information density of several paragraphs. While the sentence-level construction is generally sound, this recurring scaffold prevents the prose from achieving the highest level of polish and efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, but it is weakened by a few noticeable artifacts. The phrase "slumbering beast breathing softly" is a stock metaphor, and a paraphrase loop occurs near the end: "...she always emerges transformed always, each year becoming more attuned..." The second half restates the first, dulling the impact of a key thematic moment.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and generally effective, but it is hampered by minor artifacts. The repetition of the phrase "beneath the ashes" in two different contexts functions as a conceptual loop that feels authorial. Furthermore, the final two paragraphs shift into a summary-like mode that reports on the character's changes and their effects, which sacrifices the immediacy and momentum built during the greenhouse sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear but is weakened by conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops, particularly when defining the coin's significance. It relies heavily on abstract nouns ("luminous regret," "fractured purpose") to convey emotional states. The final paragraphs are particularly slack, restating the thematic resolution multiple times, which dulls the impact of the final image and slows momentum at a critical point.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft shows promise with some evocative imagery ("pockets heavy with whispered regrets"), but it is weakened by prose artifacts. These include repetition of key phrases ("modestly fearless," "luminous ache") and a reliance on abstract, overwritten concepts like "beautiful suffering between worlds." Such elements create a slight drag on momentum and would require a firm editorial hand before publication.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose contains striking images but is often overwrought, with a high density of conceptual jargon and figurative language that can feel labored ("anticipatory rigor," "ultraviolet penance"). There are instances of conceptual looping where similar abstract ideas about his condition are restated in different terms, slightly impeding momentum. The piece would benefit from more concision and trust in its simpler, more concrete sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean but hampered by significant repetition of key phrases like "anchors of intuition," "elusively tangible," and "between-worlds translator." This recurrence acts as a "template cadence" artifact, and while it creates an incantatory rhythm, it ultimately dulls momentum and reads as a stylistic tic rather than a nuanced, evolving motif. This loop-like quality is the story's most notable mechanical flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, concise, and carries strong momentum, with a high density of purposeful information. However, a few instances of thematic abstraction and repetition slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. The recurrence of "weightless burden" and the explicit summary in "closing the cracks in the façade between worlds with acceptance instead of fear" are minor scaffolding artifacts that prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Each sentence works hard to build the story's unique atmosphere. The final line, "The rustling awakenings had only just begun," feels like a slight cliché that somewhat tempers the power of the preceding, more specific imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally elegant and precise, with high information density in its descriptions. The prose propels the narrative with a stately, rhythmic momentum. The primary weakness is a tendency toward summary in pivotal moments, particularly the concluding paragraphs, which explain the manuscript's effect rather than letting the characters' reactions show it, slightly dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, primarily through an over-reliance on similes ("like a composer's," "like perfume," "like a violet," "like steam," "like dawn"). This density of figurative language, combined with conceptual loops like the repeated phrasing around "mending what isn't torn" and "reclaimed light," slightly dulls the momentum and feels more like a stylistic tic than a controlled effect.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but it is significantly weakened by a critical text artifact. The repeated, declarative phrase "hinged awakening" functions as a mechanical label for the story's pivotal moments, telling the reader about a profound shift rather than showing it. This structural scaffolding, left in the final prose, dulls the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=4.1)
    The prose is burdened by significant repetition and scaffolding. Key phrases from the prompt are recycled verbatim throughout the story ("spirited driftwood sculptor," "timewoven alliances," "turbine-hum reverie"), creating a template-cadence that feels artificial and slows momentum. These text artifacts, particularly the abstract jargon, obscure the emotional core of the story beneath a layer of overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often elegant and evocative, it is marred by a noticeable text artifact. The phrase "dawning hush" is repeated three times, functioning as a loop that diminishes in power with each use and feels like a writerly tic. This redundancy, particularly its appearance in the opening, the climax, and the conclusion, detracts from an otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is often lyrical and evocative, its primary mode is summary, which sacrifices momentum and immediacy. Pivotal moments—like the first retrocognitive experience or the decision to petition the captain—are recounted rather than shown, reading more like an outline than a scene. This strategic choice to tell, not show, pervades the piece, and while the language is polished, the narrative propulsion is consistently sluggish as a result.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and competent but lacks propulsion, sometimes relying on scaffolding like "He began to conceive..." or summarizing pivotal moments like "The amber bottle with no opening suddenly made sense to him." While generally clear, the rhythm is somewhat uniform, and there are minor redundancies. These small issues accumulate, creating a slight drag on what is otherwise a very clear narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and purposeful, with high information density and strong rhythm. The story avoids most line-level artifacts. The main weakness is a slight tendency toward declarative summary in key moments, such as "He would need to preserve not just the oath words any longer, but the emotional patterns..." This slightly reduces momentum by telling what could be left as a felt implication of his final actions.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but its primary weakness is a tendency toward conceptual redundancy. Several adjacent sentences restate the same idea in slightly different terms (e.g., the two sentences describing her shift from abstract to visceral understanding). This creates minor paraphrase loops that slightly slow the momentum. A line like "a decreasing scale of entropy made manifest" also feels more like a label than an organic description, a small artifact in otherwise excellent prose.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often evocative, particularly in its descriptions of setting. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding and redundancy, such as paraphrasing the same idea in different paragraphs (e.g., describing his listening habits). The final two paragraphs lean more towards summary than scene, slightly dulling the immediacy of the climax. While the line-level craft is strong, it occasionally prioritizes stating the theme over maintaining momentum through pure action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and maintains momentum, but it leans heavily on high-level abstractions like "cosmic consciousness" and "flourishing stillness" rather than grounding the experience in more concrete, sensory language. There are minor instances of paraphrase loops where a concept is immediately restated in slightly different terms. The overall effect is competent and atmospheric but lacks the precision and density of exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often elegant, it is hampered by a recurring tendency to summarize insights and label concepts rather than dramatizing their discovery. Phrases like "a tangible manifestation of a tangled covenant" or "they understood the covenant's requirement" function as conceptual scaffolding. This artifact of telling over showing is particularly jarring in a story championing unspoken truth, and it measurably dulls the impact of pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clear but relies heavily on abstract conceptual language ("temporal energy," "fractured chronology," "temporal resonance") that tells more than it shows. There is some repetition and paraphrase-looping in the final act, where her purpose is restated multiple times in slightly different ways, which slows the momentum into the otherwise strong final image. The sentence structure is competent but lacks the propulsive variety for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is elegant and grammatically precise, but it verges on being overwritten. A very high density of figurative language ("woven dawns," "palimpsest of nature's own making," "burnished hush") occasionally clutters the prose rather than clarifying it. Some adjacent phrases function as synonym loops ("release," "surrender," "letting go"), which slightly hinders momentum despite the aesthetic appeal.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains a consistent tone. However, it occasionally relies on abstract labels for emotional and conceptual states ("a gift of clarity," "His motivation crystallized") where more concrete embodiment would be stronger. The final few paragraphs contain some conceptual redundancy, restating the thematic outcome in several slightly different ways, which slows the momentum of the otherwise powerful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear, but it suffers from significant scaffold-like repetition. Phrases such as "luminous skeptic," "bronze quiet," and "chemistry of homecoming" are used like tags rather than integrated descriptions, creating a template cadence that dulls momentum. This stylistic tic is the story's most significant line-level flaw, hindering its ability to feel fully organic.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally well-crafted, with a consistent rhythm. However, some figurative language veers into sentimentality ("a soft language of hope speaking to the waiting soil"). The primary weakness is that the final two paragraphs function as scaffolding, summarizing the outcome and theme instead of letting the preceding scene work achieve its full effect, which dulls the impact of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and controlled, but weakened by noticeable repetition. The phrases "wild hush" and "tinted revelations" each appear three times; while clearly intended as motifs, they begin to feel like stylistic crutches rather than evolving images. This loop-like quality, alongside a few overwritten phrases, slightly dulls the narrative momentum and prevents the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically clean but suffers from significant repetition and scaffold-like phrasing. Key concepts ("shutdown," "true north," "temporally stretched") are looped frequently. The phrase "turn confusion into exploration" appears as a stated motivation and then again as a concluding epiphany, creating a circular, programmatic feel that dulls the impact of the language.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum effectively. Sentences are grammatically sound and the narrative flow is professional. The score is held back by a reliance on abstract labels for emotion and character ("chivalrous by nature," "cautious abandon") instead of more concrete, embodied language, and by occasional clichés like "his heart both racing and calm."

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often evocative and precise, but it suffers from some conceptual looping and overuse of key phrases ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous absence," "benevolently," "ruthlessly"). While these terms are central, their repetition occasionally feels like a checklist rather than organic prose, dulling momentum slightly. The sentence "To be a historian of small gestures meant preserving..." is a moment of telling that paraphrases what the scene has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from occasional overwriting and reliance on abstract nouns and stock phrases ("force of a blow," "soil of doubt"). The final paragraph becomes a cascade of high-concept abstractions ("pure light," "nexus of all stories," "tapestry woven with threads of belonging") that, while thematically coherent, slightly dulls the specificity that made the feather's texture so effective earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and controlled but leans on abstractions ("catastrophic arrogance," "salvation of humility") and occasional paraphrase loops that slow momentum. For example, "a memory reconsidered, a moment reframed, an understood truth" restates the same idea three ways. The final two paragraphs rely heavily on summary, which lessens the impact of the on-page resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often evocative and lyrical, but it suffers from conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. The core idea of "refracting a single truth" is restated in numerous ways throughout the text, which dulls momentum. For example, the function of her poetry is explained multiple times using similar phrasing. While individual sentences are well-crafted, their accumulation creates a sense of stasis rather than propulsion, particularly in the middle of the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it occasionally tips into being overly ornate, with figurative language stacked a bit too densely. The final paragraph contains a minor paraphrase loop ("he finally understood... In the end, he realized...") that summarizes the same idea twice, slightly slowing the momentum of the otherwise powerful ending. The line-level craft is strong but lacks the final degree of concision that would make it exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally possesses a strong rhythmic quality. Momentum is well-maintained, and word choice is precise. The score is slightly reduced by minor prose artifacts, including a paraphrase loop ("unmistakably his work... unmistakably his own... unmistakably his work") and a few sentences that lean on a conventional template cadence, particularly in the final paragraph, which slightly softens the landing of an otherwise powerful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often evocative. However, a few key phrases like "tears of screaming tenderness" and "purified intentions" lean towards overwriting and abstraction. The line "pure intent having bridged the distance that a shout could never cross" functions more as a summary of the theme than as a concrete, imagistic moment, slightly dulling the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm is generally well-paced, slowing for reflection and quickening during the climactic act of navigation. The score is lowered by the final two paragraphs, which function as a summary loop, restating the established premise ("The cryptic phone calls...would continue") and dulling the impact of the powerful preceding image of the smiling navigator and the grateful ship.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and contains strong, purposeful imagery, such as the "arthritic fingers" of the branches and the "frozen lightning" in the glass eye. There are minor instances of scaffolding, where a concept is stated and then immediately paraphrased for emphasis. The primary flaw is in the final paragraphs, where the syntax becomes overly explanatory, summarizing the story's meaning rather than letting the final image carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often luminous and precise, especially in the opening paragraphs. However, the momentum is slightly dulled by a key instance of telling over showing: "The borrowed memories had finally resolved into a complete narrative—of a man who had lost everything..." This summarizing block explains the mystery rather than allowing the reader to experience the final fragments clicking into place with Elias, slightly flattening the climax's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely clear, concise, and often elegant. However, a few key moments rely on abstraction or slightly generic phrasing that dulls their impact (e.g., "Understanding dawned slowly," "possibilities realigned"). These instances of telling, particularly at moments of peak discovery, stand out against the otherwise strong, image-driven writing.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains striking images ("bleeding starlight," "lacy menace"), but it tends to summarize key moments instead of letting them unfold purely through action and perception. Lines like "With understanding came power" and the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement are instances of telling where showing would be more powerful. This lack of concision at critical junctures prevents the prose from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from noticeable repetition and abstract overwriting. The phrase "scientifically romantic" is used twice in nearly identical ways, creating a distinct loop. Abstract nouns like "palette of resolve" and "density of presence" are used as narrative scaffolding, telling the reader the emotional state rather than grounding it in concrete sensation, which dulls the immediacy of key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with powerful images and a strong narrative rhythm. However, there is a slight tendency towards high-register abstractions like "feral nostalgia" and "jaded wonder" that occasionally feel more like labels than embodied experiences. While ambitious and largely successful, these moments slightly reduce the prose's overall groundedness and immediacy, representing a minor but noticeable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, often elegant, and possesses a steady rhythm that complements the story's atmosphere. There is a minor tendency to label emotional states rather than embody them fully through action or specific sensation. The primary weakness is the stilted quality of the dialogue, which reads more like written prose than natural speech.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with strong verbs and evocative sensory details. Sentences like "its vapors coiling upward like miniature dragons" create a vivid, immersive atmosphere. While the craft is exceptional, a couple of instances lean towards summary, such as "converted painful memory into protective wisdom," slightly reducing the otherwise potent immediacy of the scene work. There are no loops, scaffolds, or other prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it's hampered by a tendency toward overwriting. Figurative language is dense, with some phrases like "shattered sandals can carry us home" feeling strained and muddled. The aphoristic dialogue acts as a prose artifact, prioritizing poetic pronouncements over momentum and clarity in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from significant conceptual looping. Key phrases like "spiral arbitration," "wanderingly exact," and "journeying inward while walking out" are repeated verbatim throughout the text. While this creates a patterned, incantatory effect, it functions as a prose artifact that slows momentum and feels like scaffolding rather than organically evolving language, measurably dulling propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but it is marked by repetitive phrasing ("through counting backwards," "razor edges," "eminently peculiar"). This recurrence feels more like a mechanical motif than an organic development, creating a slight looping effect that dulls momentum. While the imagery is often strong, these prose artifacts prevent the line-level craft from achieving a higher tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but marred by a significant repetitive artifact. The exact phrase "quiet wildfire" is used twice to describe two different moments of internal transformation, which reads as a loop rather than an intentional echo. This repetition, along with some abstract phrasing, dulls the precision and momentum of an otherwise functional prose style.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density and evocative language. However, the penultimate paragraph contains a conceptual paraphrase loop. The sentence explaining her "theoretically rebellious approach" and the subsequent one defining her journey as a "pilgrimage to reconcile the lucid contradictions" restate the same core realization, creating a slight momentum drag just before the otherwise stellar conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often lyrical but is marred by repetitive phrasing of key concepts ("cultivated estrangement," "melodically haunted"). These text artifacts feel like scaffolding that should have been removed. Additionally, a line like "His cultivated estrangement had become a curated space for new beginnings" drifts into an abstract, diagnostic register that clashes with the otherwise concrete voice of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that slightly dull the momentum. The repetition of key phrases ("haunted euphoria," "proximate causes") feels like a scaffold rather than an organic return. The phrase "through proximate causes" is particularly jarring, an abstract, scientific intrusion into a deeply sensory and emotional moment that constitutes a register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and demonstrates a strong command of imagery ("platforms disappearing beneath waves of ivy"). Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative efficiently. The only minor weakness is a tendency toward summary in the final section, which, while clear, slightly reduces the immediacy and momentum of the story's conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the final third contains several instances of conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops that slow momentum. For example, the function of the "internal compass" is described in two slightly different ways across consecutive sentences, and the final line repeats the "quiet blaze" motif for a third time, slightly diminishing its impact through overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean, clear, and grammatically sound, avoiding any major errors. Its primary flaw is a tendency toward abstraction and summary where concrete action would be more powerful, particularly when describing motivations and the effects of the pen. Sentences often explain the concept ("History was not being rewritten so much as gently guided") rather than grounding the moment in sensory detail, resulting in a loss of immediacy and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, but it suffers from overwriting and repetition that dull momentum. There are several paraphrase loops, such as restating the idea that silence is music. The repeated use of "joyful sorrow" is a significant prose artifact. While many individual sentences are strong, these patterns of redundancy prevent the piece from feeling fully polished and concise.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=4.0)
    The prose is fatally hampered by its reliance on summary, which destroys any sense of momentum or immediacy. Entire sections of the plot are condensed into single sentences, replacing scene-work with exposition. The repetition of "volcanic tenderness" four times acts as a prose artifact, and the overall rhythm is that of a fable being recounted, not a story being lived.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with powerful, memorable phrases. There is a slight tendency towards conceptual overwriting, such as "the hush of the universe inhaling," which, while beautiful, verges on abstraction. The final paragraph also contains some summary-scaffolding ("she also knew something the doctors didn't") that momentarily lessens the immediacy of the final image, a small drag on an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, but a few moments rely on telling rather than showing ("a sensation that always preceded moments of profound clarity"). These minor slips slightly reduce the immediacy of Marlo's interiority, preventing the prose from reaching flawless execution, though they do not affect the clarity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose is marred by significant conceptual redundancy and paraphrase loops. Key phrases—"teach darkness the value of stars," "silent empathy," "spiralingly calm," "half-spoken secret"—are repeated to the point of diminishing returns, functioning as boilerplate. This repetition dulls the momentum and gives the piece a mechanical feel, despite its evocative vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the setting. Momentum is generally well-maintained. A minor flaw is a tendency toward summary in the concluding paragraphs, with sentences like "The rebellion had been humble indeed, but its impact..." reading more like an analysis of the story than a continuation of it, which slightly flattens the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density and strong imagery ("fragments of liquid moonlight"). However, a few phrases like "woven into the fabric of her being" and "battlefield of hope and fear" feel slightly less fresh than the surrounding text. These minor instances of stock phrasing are the only elements holding the line-level craft back from true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong opening imagery. However, it sometimes leans on abstract language ("theater of existence," "protest against oblivion") where concrete detail would be more powerful. The cadence of the narrated actions ("With this deliberate incision," "Now I shall quench my thirst") risks becoming a repetitive template, slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.8)
    While the prose is clear, it is critically hampered by line-level artifacts. There are numerous instances of paraphrase-loops where adjacent sentences or clauses restate the same information using different words (e.g., "...a vibration that transcended sound and became pure sensation."). This redundancy, combined with repetitive sentence structures, significantly dulls momentum and reads like authorial scaffolding rather than sharp, propulsive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the final paragraph slips into abstract, slightly overwritten language ("arrange our lives to receive them, petal by petal, word by word..."). This shift in register, combined with the repetition of the "innocently cunning" label, creates a minor scaffold-like feel that dulls the impact of the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the prose is clean on a surface level, it is severely hampered by patterned repetition. Key phrases—"powerfully gentle," "golden shadows," "artificial pilgrimage," "texture of connection"—are looped throughout the text. This functions as a prose artifact that dulls momentum and makes the narrative feel formulaic, measurably weakening the impact of the closure by hammering keywords instead of trusting the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density. However, the final paragraphs contain conceptual redundancies, summarizing roles and themes that the preceding text had already established through action. Phrases like "a guardian..., a teacher..., a beacon..." create a list-like cadence that feels less organic than the prose in the main body, slightly dulling the momentum at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong sensory details. However, there are moments where momentum is slowed by abstract, academic phrasing ("precipitated the catastrophic financial collapse," "multiplying paths of interpretation"). The line describing the collaboration—"expanded exponentially through their dialogue"—is a summary that replaces a potentially powerful dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative. The primary weakness is the repetitive use of key conceptual phrases—"anguished joy," "forbidden knowledge," "end of innocence"—which function as textual loops. This recurrence, while thematically relevant, feels slightly mechanical and lessens the sense of organic discovery for the reader, creating a minor drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative for the first two-thirds of the story. However, the final section suffers from significant momentum loss due to repetitive phrasing and summary. The final five paragraphs create a series of paraphrase loops, each restating the story's new thematic resolution without adding new information or pressure, which dulls the impact of the powerful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean but suffers from minor but persistent artifacts, particularly paraphrase loops that state an idea twice in adjacent phrases. For instance, "reconstruction was possible, that shedding layers was not loss but transformation" is redundant. This pattern slightly dulls the momentum and information density, especially near the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from abstract phrasing ("displaced miracle," "temporal healing") and conceptual redundancy, especially in the final third. The last few paragraphs engage in paraphrase-loops, restating the central theme in slightly different ways, which stalls momentum. This summary-like quality dulls the impact of the otherwise strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers significantly from repetitive phrasing and scaffold-like sentence structures. Key terms ("crystal gazer," "psychometry reading," "spatially imaginative," "hushed thunder") are looped excessively, creating momentum drag and a sense of lexical poverty. This textual artifact, while perhaps aiming for a poetic effect, ultimately reads as overwriting and severely hinders the story's propulsion and clarity at a line level.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that often dulls rather than sharpens the imagery ("ice in her creative channels," "river flowing freely"). There are moments of syntactic repetition ("her hands could no longer..., her brush could no longer...") and synonym stacking ("shape and form and express") that clutter the lines and detract from an otherwise clear narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often beautiful, but it suffers from noticeable repetition of key phrases ("glowing dune in bloom," "cultivate the sparks," "through wave functions"). While thematic recurrence can be powerful, here it sometimes feels like a scaffold, creating minor rhythmic loops that slightly dull the momentum. This prevents an otherwise strong piece from achieving the highest level of polish, as the repetition borders on a template-cadence artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clear and functional, with some strong images like the "crystalline memories and rivers of emotional light." However, it is hampered by repetitive phrasing and conceptual redundancy. For instance, the "hum of insight" and the "shift to wonder" are mentioned multiple times without significant variation, and the final paragraphs summarize insights that were already dramatized, slowing the momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. However, there are moments where the figurative language becomes slightly dense or self-conscious, bordering on overwriting. For instance, "understanding washing over her like the shoreline lullaby that had accompanied their journey" is a somewhat mechanical callback that tells rather than shows the moment of insight.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in most lines. Word choice is excellent ("seraphically mundane," "frostbitten hope"). The only minor weakness is a slight increase in scaffolding in the final paragraphs. The repetition of sentence stems like "The bellhop realized..." and "The bellhop had finally understood..." creates a summary-like cadence that slightly dulls the immediacy of the otherwise powerful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, there is a recurring reliance on high-level abstractions ("memory of what once was," "bound in shadow and starlight") that can keep the emotional core at a distance. The final paragraph contains some scaffolding and summary that could be excised for a sharper, more resonant finish.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clear, concise, and generally free of errors. However, there are minor artifacts that hold it back from the highest tier. The repetition of "periodically eternal" feels slightly forced, like an echo of a prompt. Some sentences, particularly those explaining the theme, lack the density and propulsion of the story's best descriptive passages, creating small pockets of momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often evocative and rhythmic, but is hampered by occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing ("graveyard of technological ambition," "language of the universe itself"). There is a minor paraphrase loop in "a powerful calm that seemed to absorb her fears and amplify her hopes simultaneously," which restates the idea of "thunderous serenity" without adding new information. The final paragraphs lean heavily on abstract nouns, slightly dulling the immediacy of the otherwise strong climax.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery in the first half. However, momentum flags in the final paragraphs, which shift toward summary and abstraction ("As she held it, Maya understood its purpose..."). This "telling" of the climax and its meaning, along with some slightly clichéd phrasing ("alive with possibility"), dulls the impact of an otherwise solid execution.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often elegant and features strong, specific imagery. However, the final two paragraphs are burdened by summary and scaffolding that state what the story has already shown ("The quietly talented gardener had become a student of resilience..."). This overwriting dulls the momentum and impact of the closure, representing a significant line-level flaw in an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with a high density of figurative language. At times, particularly in the opening, it verges on being overwritten, with a string of metaphors that slows momentum. While individual phrases are strong, their sheer quantity can feel like a layer of ornament rather than a direct conduit to the character's experience. The piece avoids major artifacts like loops, but a more economical approach would heighten the impact of its strongest images.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clear, concise, and largely free of errors. However, it occasionally relies on abstract, academic phrasing ("temporal distortion," "scientific comprehension") rather than grounding concepts in concrete sensory experience. Some sentences function more as scaffolding or summary ("This ink was the key..."), slightly reducing momentum and information density in key moments. The line-level craft is strong but could be more consistently propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from severe text-looping and scaffolding. The constant repetition of key phrases ("dizzying quiet," "within the blink that follows surprise") creates a monotonous, template-like cadence that dulls momentum. This is a fundamental craft issue that prevents the piece from feeling polished and organic.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and often elegant, but it is hampered by occasional awkward phrasing and abstract language where concrete imagery would be stronger. The phrase "senselessly perceptive" is unclear and clunky. More critically, the story leans on abstract summary ("absorbing her tranquility, her resilience, her fierce desire") to describe its central magical process, which could have been rendered with more visceral, sensory detail. This tendency to tell dulls the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and imaginative, with strong verbs and a varied sentence structure. However, it suffers from a very high density of figurative and conceptual language, especially in the first half. Phrases like "sound wave garden," "dancing, transparent flora," and "constellations sleepwalked" are introduced in rapid succession, which can feel more like an inventory of concepts than an immersive experience. This tendency toward abstraction slightly dulls the story's immediacy, bordering on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from significant scaffolding and repetition that stalls momentum. Phrases are repeated verbatim across paragraphs, and the core investigative action is told ("she began mapping out the logical impossibilities") rather than shown through concrete detail. The result is a narrative that feels summarized and abstract, with several paraphrase-loops (e.g., "playful solemnity" and "solemn playfulness") that indicate a lack of line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and high information density. However, a few phrases like "raking at the dissonance of old guilt that nested in his chest" rely on abstract emotional labels rather than concrete embodiment. While the overall quality is high, these minor instances of overwriting prevent it from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. The story's momentum is slightly dulled near the end by sentences that summarize what has just been shown (e.g., "The social perceptive artist had interjected through art rather than lecture..."). While the line-level craft is high, these moments of redundant telling momentarily weaken the otherwise immersive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often evocative but occasionally slips into overwriting and conceptual redundancy. The repeated metaphor of empathy/compassion as "steel" feels heavy-handed, and a phrase like "the warm coldness" is a clumsy oxymoron that muddles rather than clarifies. While generally clean, these prose artifacts slightly dull the impact of key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, particularly in its sensory descriptions. However, it occasionally becomes overwrought, with figurative language in nearly every sentence, which can slightly dull momentum. Some phrases, like despair "receding like a tide," rely on familiar constructions. The final two sentences verge on summarizing the theme, which is less powerful than allowing the preceding images to do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness due to severe repetition and scaffold-like phrasing. Multiple key phrases are repeated verbatim across paragraphs, creating paraphrase loops and a template cadence (e.g., "The telepathy pill recall had been...," "Her motivation to illuminate hidden pathways..."). This repetition significantly slows momentum and makes the story feel like an assembly of required components rather than an organic narrative, dulling the impact of otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.7)
    While generally clear, the prose tends to summarize pivotal moments of insight ("She realized it had been waiting for her") rather than showing them through embodied action or imagery. This preference for telling over showing dulls the impact of the climax. Additionally, the awkward repetition of the phrase "factually mystical" stands out as a line-level artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clean and clear, but it leans on abstract language ("raw possibility," "ancient resonance," "communal wisdom") where concrete imagery would be stronger. There are moments of telling instead of showing emotional states ("Elara felt a profound connection"). This tendency to summarize pivotal feelings and concepts keeps the prose from achieving the highest level of immediacy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often lyrical, but it carries minor artifacts that prevent it from reaching the highest tier. The deliberate repetition of key phrases ("silver hush," "prudently daring") feels slightly mechanical, bordering on a template cadence. Some figurative language, such as the storm within raging like the storm without, verges on cliché, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. The sentence structure varies effectively, creating a deliberate and unhurried pace that suits the narrative. The piece avoids major artifacts, but a few conceptual repetitions—such as the near-identical phrasing around "distill complexity into essence"—create minor loops that could be tightened for greater concision and impact, preventing an otherwise stellar performance from reaching the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it suffers from minor repetitive phrasing ("sharp gentleness," "following sun patterns") that becomes noticeable. Some sentences feel slightly overwritten or lean on abstractions where a concrete image would be stronger. The final paragraph's shift into summary mode dulls the propulsive, imagistic momentum built earlier in the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and often beautiful, with strong imagery and rhythm ("shimmered like liquid mercury," "quivering hush"). The primary weakness is a tendency toward conceptual labels and scaffold phrases that tell rather than show. The repetition of "wistfully pragmatic" for both Mara and Jim feels like an authorial imposition. These moments of abstraction interrupt the otherwise strong sensory flow and create minor momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery ("shelves expanding and contracting like breathing lungs"). Its main weakness is a slight tendency to summarize key transitions with abstract statements ("The method of coexistence revealed itself gradually") instead of dramatizing them through concrete action or sensory detail. This occasionally slows momentum, but the line-level craft in the core scenes remains very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=2.1)
    The prose suffers from severe and systemic text-artifact issues, specifically the verbatim repetition of at least six key phrases throughout the narrative. This creates a templated, looped feeling that reads as mechanical and overwrought, fundamentally undermining momentum and craft. This flaw pervades the piece, including the closure, and is its most significant barrier to publication.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, avoiding significant errors. Its primary weakness is a reliance on telling over showing in crucial moments, particularly the backstory and the resolution. Phrases like "air crackled with an energy" and "ethereal grit" are somewhat stock, and the final paragraph's rapid summary of a week's events sacrifices immediacy for narrative efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and clear but contains minor genre clichés ("pressing darkness," "coursed through her veins") and moments of slight redundancy. For instance, the character's motivation is restated with slightly different phrasing in the first half. The sentence structure is solid but lacks the varied rhythm and high information density that would make it exceptional; it's professional but not distinguished.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and concise, with some effective atmospheric touches like the recurring "furrowed hush." However, it occasionally slips into melodrama ("lance through what others could not see") or abstract summary ("unifying opposites"). The primary flaw is its reliance on telling over showing at the story's most crucial juncture, the off-page confession, which is a structural issue manifested at the prose level.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear, but momentum is significantly hampered by the sheer volume of backstory summary, which constitutes over a third of the text. This reliance on telling rather than showing slows the pace and distances the reader from the present action. While individual sentences are well-formed, the narrative structure chosen at the line-level prioritizes exposition over immediacy, which feels inefficient for a story of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its high density of figurative and abstract language sometimes feels overwritten. Phrases like "pixelated amnesty," "luminous disbelief," and "symphony of pixelated amnesty" are powerful but their close clustering can feel strenuous. There is a slight tendency toward conceptual paraphrase, where an idea is restated with different impressive-sounding words, which slightly slows momentum in a few key spots.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose is generally clean, it is significantly marred by repetitive phrasing. The constant recycling of "perceptively calm" and "dusky harmony" functions as a template-cadence artifact that dulls momentum and reduces information density. These loops are a notable flaw that prevents the line-level craft from reaching a higher level of polish and specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear and functional, but it tends toward abstraction and cliché ("satisfaction of a quest fulfilled," "peaceful certainty"). The repetition of "understanding dawning" feels heavy-handed. There are several instances of telling over showing, particularly in summarizing emotional states rather than embodying them through concrete action or perception.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is dense and often overwritten, with stacked adjectives and evocative phrases that occasionally blur rather than sharpen the imagery. There are several instances of repetitive phrasing and near-paraphrasing that slow momentum, such as describing the spiraling/circling magic in multiple ways in close succession. The line-level craft is competent but lacks the concision and rhythmic variety of top-tier prose.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose has a clear rhythm, but it suffers from overwriting and repetition that dull its momentum. The constant emphasis on the color "blue" becomes excessive, and conceptual redundancies appear, such as "trapped...by their own limited vision" followed by being "bound by the present reality." The repetition of "anxious elation" feels like a prose artifact rather than an intentional refrain.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and maintains momentum, but it is hampered by minor, recurring issues. There is some repetition of key phrases ("fierce gentleness") and a tendency towards abstract labels like "feathers of resolve." The presence of a typo ("укрепed") is a small but notable flaw that points to a lack of final polish. These artifacts slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, a few lines drift toward declarative summary, slightly reducing momentum. For instance, "When Marcus discovered purpose after loss, it was in moments like these" tells the reader the theme directly instead of letting the preceding scene do the work entirely. These minor instances are the only friction in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, intelligent, and largely excellent, with strong rhythm and sentence variety. However, it occasionally defaults to summary for pivotal moments of characterization and process ("she approached her task with kindly methodical precision"). While the language is elevated, a few phrases like "spiritual evolution" and the "heat mirage on a desert highway" simile feel slightly less fresh than the surrounding prose, holding it just back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, specific imagery like the "cold fire that only consumed paper and ink." The rhythm is well-controlled and sentences are generally clear and purposeful. The final paragraphs, however, drift toward abstraction and summary, slightly reducing the line-level propulsion established earlier in the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from moments of overwriting and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "not as memories, but as possibilities, as futures that might yet be realized" and "transforming her from an inspector of endings into a harbinger of new beginnings" are paraphrase loops that state the same idea twice. The reliance on abstract nouns and some stock phrasing ("practiced efficiency," "liquid sunlight") dulls the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often evocative, with strong verbs and purposeful rhythm. However, it is marred by several issues that prevent it from reaching a publishable standard. The critical error of "市政府" is a major line-level failure. Furthermore, the final paragraphs contain paraphrase loops that restate the thematic resolution multiple times, reducing momentum and dulling the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from occasional overwriting and redundancy. Phrases like "tall as a cathedral yet organic as a living thing" are effective, but are sometimes followed by paraphrase-loops that restate the same idea in different terms. There is a tendency towards adjectival stacking and abstract summary, especially near the end. The sentence-level propulsion is steady but rarely dynamic, lacking the syntactic variety to truly accelerate or decelerate with the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is largely elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the line "a chaotic水下摄影 she’d perfected" is a significant and jarring flaw. The un-italicized, unexplained Chinese characters (meaning "underwater photography") break immersion and clarity so completely that they read as a textual artifact, severely damaging an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in its descriptive passages. Sentences are crafted with care, advancing atmosphere and character simultaneously. The piece avoids significant artifacts, though a couple of phrases like "velvet of night" touch upon familiar convention, a minor blemish on an otherwise impeccable surface.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from noticeable repetition and scaffold phrases. Key descriptors like "kindly decisive," "vineyard hush," "antique hairpin," and "climbing trees to think better" are reused multiple times, creating a templated feel that dulls momentum. This repetition reads less like intentional lyricism and more like a limited lexical palette. The final use of "scalloped against the clouds" feels like a strained effort to force a motif, an artifact of overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    While generally clean, the prose suffers from the repetitive use of its central conceptual labels. The phrase "cloak of doubt" is mentioned three times, functioning as a recurring scaffold rather than an evolving image. This repetition creates a noticeable prose artifact that slightly dulls the momentum and feels overly insistent.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from repetition and scaffolding. Phrases like "sycamore hush" and the core thematic concept are repeated, dulling their impact. The sentence "Through the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown, wisdom emerges" reads like an intrusive summary. The prose lacks the unique texture needed for the highest tier, relying on functional rather than evocative language.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the prose is clean and often evocative, it suffers from two notable issues. First, a high density of adjectives sometimes clutters sentences and reduces momentum. Second, and more critically, the final paragraphs contain paraphrase loops where the story's theme and Kael's realization are explained multiple times in slightly different ways, creating scaffolding that dulls the impact of the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, with strong imagery like "painted the clouds with prescribed patterns" and "illuminating not surfaces but possibilities." Momentum is solid through the climax. The primary flaw is in the final two paragraphs, which shift from showing to strategic telling that borders on summary, slightly dulling the propulsive energy built during the journey and discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often evocative, with strong phrases like "meteor hush" and "floating constellation." However, it occasionally slips into overwriting with redundant modifiers ("luminous vow of pure silver light") and abstract conceptual phrases ("a truth that hides behind truth itself"). There is also some minor template cadence ("As he reached... As he turned... As he lit...") that slightly dulls the otherwise strong rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose contains several significant text artifacts that would require heavy editing. There are multiple instances of paraphrase-loops and a heavy reliance on repeating the same key phrases (e.g., "quiet enthusiasm" appears 4 times, "backwards prophecy" 5 times). This creates a template-like cadence that dulls momentum and signals a lack of confidence in dramatization, substituting repetition for development. This is the story's most significant flaw at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong line-level craft, particularly in its imagery. However, the piece is marked by a few noticeable prose artifacts that prevent a higher score. The repetition of key phrases like "crystallized through scattered light" and "echo of sacrifice" creates a template-like cadence in places, slightly dulling the impact of otherwise powerful moments.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clear, with strong, evocative imagery like the bell as a "fallen giant" and the sound of "settling stars." Sentence structure is varied and the rhythm supports the melancholic yet hopeful mood. The primary flaw is the final section's slide into exposition, summarizing the thematic and emotional beats instead of letting the preceding concrete imagery do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean and often lyrical. However, there are moments of thematic overwriting where the language becomes too abstract or declarative, such as "The precisely humane approach...demanded nothing less than..." This pulls the reader out of Thomas's immediate experience and into an authorial summary. A few phrases feel slightly worn ("hovering just below consciousness"), preventing the line-level craft from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, but it frequently leans into overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and ornate similes ("cascading like molten copper," "shimmered with all colors imaginable"). This decorative layer sometimes slows momentum rather than sharpens the image. The line-level craft is competent, but a more concise and selective approach to description would heighten its power.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from severe structural repetition and paraphrase loops, a significant prose artifact. Key phrases and even entire paragraph concepts are repeated almost verbatim (e.g., the two "The watcher's burden..." paragraphs, the two "Attentively inventive..." paragraphs). This redundancy drains momentum and gives the piece a scaffold-like quality, as if constructed from a checklist rather than flowing from a narrative impulse.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clear and functional, but suffers from minor momentum drag due to paraphrase loops that restate Maya's emotional state. Several sentences rely on abstract nouns rather than concrete actions or sensory details, which slightly flattens the texture. The overall craft is competent but lacks the propulsion and information density of exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose is undermined by significant line-level artifacts, primarily severe repetition and paraphrase loops. Key phrases ("flow," "orthogonal," "safeguard space," "notably receptive mind") are reused to the point of becoming scaffolding. This lexical and conceptual looping drains momentum and gives the piece a mechanical, template-driven feel, obscuring its moments of genuine atmospheric strength.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.3)
    While often evocative, the prose is significantly weakened by text-artifact loops. Key phrases—"mournfully eager," "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind," "echo chamber tunnel"—are repeated to the point of diminishing returns, feeling more like authorial insistence than organic rhythm. This repetitive scaffolding dulls the otherwise sharp execution and prevents the prose from achieving true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise ("weathered smooth by time," "oceans of liquid starlight"). However, it relies heavily on abstract conceptual language ("method of interiorizing exteriors," "expanded to another density") which can feel like jargon and slows the narrative. There are minor paraphrase loops where the same idea about uncertainty is re-stated in slightly different terms, indicating a need for greater concision in expressing the core philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and maintains a strong rhythm. However, there are instances of redundancy that slightly reduce momentum. For example, the line "...revealing the sensitive heart that remained stoically hidden behind his focused exterior" is a paraphrase loop that restates the preceding clause. The final paragraphs also shift towards a more abstract, summary-like register, which dulls the immediacy of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and generally evocative, but it occasionally relies on abstract descriptors and stock phrases that dull its impact. The repetition of "serenely electric" acts as a label rather than a dynamic quality, and phrases like "pulsed in rhythm with her heartbeat" are clichés. While there are no egregious errors, the line-level craft lacks the consistent precision and information density required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative but is weakened by occasional clichés ("like a lover returning from a long absence") and telling-heavy passages that summarize transformation instead of fully immersing the reader. The repetition of the phrase "resiliently positive" is a minor scaffold. The final paragraph explaining the passengers' new state ("They would simply live more authentic lives") feels like a summary that slightly undermines the "show, don't tell" principle for the resolution's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, particularly in its description of the sinew thread. However, there's a recurring tendency to rely on abstract summary rather than concrete sensory detail at key moments. Phrases like "coalescing into forms that defied conventional logic yet felt profoundly true" explain an effect rather than making the reader feel it, slightly dulling the story's momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, especially in its descriptions of the benthic environment. There is a tendency toward abstraction and telling at key moments, such as summarizing the breakthrough ("The news spread...transforming perception"). The verbatim repetition of the phrase "somber marvel" is a minor but noticeable blemish in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative but is marred by several artifacts that detract from its momentum. The repetition of key phrases ("persistently curious," "reeling hush") feels unpolished. More critically, several sentences tend to explain the emotional or thematic weight of a moment ("it was realization") instead of letting the action and imagery carry the load, particularly in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally strong, with standout lines like "the moment when worlds nearly collided without touching." However, it is held back by occasional moments of overwriting and summary. Phrases such as "tender grace and solemn respect" tell rather than show the action, and a few similes ("yawned before her like a tired giant") feel slightly generic for an otherwise specific piece.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often evocative and precise, it occasionally slips into summary and scaffolding where concrete embodiment is needed. Lines like "...a lesson about the systems we create..." explain the theme rather than letting the events imply it. This tendency to narrate conclusions slightly dulls the immediacy of key moments, holding the otherwise strong prose back from excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with rich, specific imagery that makes the world palpable, particularly in its description of the storyteller's craft. While there are no technical flaws, the final paragraph loses some of its concrete power by shifting to a more abstract and declarative register to summarize the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with memorable phrases like "frostbitten hope" and "conspiracy of silence." The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative mood. The score is held back slightly by the final paragraph, where the language becomes more explanatory and abstract, momentarily losing the concrete, sensory quality that makes the rest of the piece so effective.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding and cliché ("motivation burned bright," "racing heart"). The final paragraphs lean heavily on summary, explaining the transformation rather than allowing the final image to carry the full weight of the change, which dulls the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is evocative and concise, with strong verbs and memorable images. However, the final ~100 words contain several instances of summary and paraphrase loops that slow momentum. For instance, the story states the bottle made it through and its meaning, then immediately restates the symbolic weight of his deliveries in different terms. This redundancy in the closure unit dulls the impact of the final, sharper images.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is rich and evocative but occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a high density of adjectives and adjectival phrases ("misting hush," "quietly persistent hands," "whispering gleam"). Some phrases feel like familiar genre shorthand ("canvas of possibility," "questions the carpenter hadn't yet learned to ask"). While the rhythm is generally strong, a stricter editorial eye would tighten the prose and increase its momentum by trimming some of the lush but redundant descriptors.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lyrical and atmospheric, but it is marked by a few distinct prose artifacts. The repetition of key phrases like "sanely eccentric" and "observed solitude" across different paragraphs creates a paraphrase loop that an editor would flag for tightening. While some repetition functions as a motif, these specific instances read as slight redundancies rather than intentional intensification, subtly impeding momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery. However, it occasionally leans heavily on abstract, high-concept phrases ("cipher of longing," "improbable beginnings"). While tonally effective, this density sometimes comes at the expense of concrete, grounded detail, particularly in the final paragraphs which summarize the revelation rather than letting it unfold entirely through Elara's immediate sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it operates at such a high figurative density ("twilight painted," "starlight inked," "cosmic possibility") that it occasionally risks feeling overwritten, calling attention to the craft. There are minor instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent phrases restate the same concept, slightly slowing momentum in an otherwise propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is marked by minor prose artifacts that slightly dull its edge. The repetition of key phrases ("crisp nostalgia," "chronically curious nature") feels like a writerly tic, preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. Lines like "the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" create a powerful mood with admirable economy. There are minor moments of overwriting where the language feels slightly self-conscious ("repository of fractured truths"), but there are no significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that impede momentum or clarity at the story's key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, but it often leans on abstract descriptions and stock phrasing ("thrum of life," "shimmered with potential," "fire within her never truly slept"). Some sentences, while atmospheric, lack informational density and slow the momentum with decorative language. The piece avoids major errors but could be sharpened by replacing generalized sentiments with more concrete, surprising imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery. However, there is a recurring pattern of conceptual labels being paired with their own definitions within a line or two (e.g., her trembling is a "visible marker of turmoil," the rainbows remind her of her "fragmented inner state"). This creates minor conceptual loops that slightly reduce information density. While the voice is strong, this tendency towards self-explanation keeps the prose from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is grammatically sound but suffers from a reliance on abstraction and declarative scaffolding, particularly in the opening and closing. Sentences frequently tell rather than show ("Elara, a perceptive map framer with a methodically curious nature..."). The final two paragraphs abandon narrative momentum for essayistic reflection, a clear example of prose artifacts that dull the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and largely concise, with strong imagery. However, the momentum is significantly dampened by the final paragraph, which functions as an expository summary of future intentions and thematic takeaways. This replaces the need for showing with telling at the crucial final moment, weakening the story's closing impact.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic, establishing the story's ethereal atmosphere from the first sentence. Word choice is generally strong, though there are moments of slight overwriting and abstraction ("harmonies that existed outside normal perception"). The primary weakness is a tendency to tell rather than show, particularly around character motivation and thematic conclusion, which adds slight drag to an otherwise propulsive and poetic piece.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and evocative for most of the story, with a controlled rhythm that matches the steady ascent of the elevator. However, the final section contains several paraphrase loops and a template cadence ("...had been a heart...", "...hadn't just solve a mystery—it had affirmed...") that dull the impact of the closure. Additionally, a foreign-language character ("化作") appears mid-sentence, a significant copy-editing failure that disrupts immersion at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it suffers from occasional redundancy and scaffolding. Several sentences paraphrase the preceding one, such as the two descriptions of her role as a "translator" of the sky. The recurrence of key phrases like "dusty starlight" and "quietly explosive" feels more like authorial insistence than organic language. These minor loops and thematic repetitions slightly dull the momentum and create a sense of being told the same thing twice.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery and a clear rhythm. However, there is some conceptual repetition around the idea of "capturing essence," which creates minor momentum drag. The use of technical-sounding terms like "fractally precise" and "algorithmic key" feels slightly less integrated into the lyrical voice, creating a small register drift that stands out against the otherwise organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clear but weakened by a tendency to summarize key moments instead of dramatizing them, most notably in the line, "What he had discovered was astounding." There are also minor redundancies, such as labeling Eli as both "diligently curious" and having a "meticulously curious nature." These instances of telling over showing, particularly at the story's climax, rob the discovery of its full emotional and narrative impact.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally elegant but is significantly flawed by conspicuous repetition. Phrases like "hauntingly bright clockmaker's gear assortment" and "Through scraps of prophecy..." are repeated verbatim, creating a prose artifact that feels like prompt-stuffing. This loop pattern dulls momentum and breaks the narrative spell, a critical issue for a piece aiming for the highest literary quality. The problem is structural and detracts from an otherwise strong descriptive style.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound but leans heavily on abstract nouns and summary ("quiet satisfaction," "collective uncertainty," "renewed vitality"). It tells the reader about emotional and physical states rather than rendering them through concrete, sensory detail. While free of major line-level artifacts, its lack of specificity and reliance on telling keeps it from being propulsive or immersive.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical, evocative, and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm and imagery. However, the piece is marked by several noticeable phraseological loops ("pane of hush," "bruised," "nested patterns") that recur without significant variation. While contributing to a hypnotic, incantatory effect, their frequency borders on a prose artifact that slightly dulls the impact of otherwise exquisite lines, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but is hindered by several artifacts. There are noticeable runs of similar sentence stems in the setup, creating a slightly plodding rhythm. The ending contains a paraphrase loop where consecutive sentences restate Elias's newfound purpose without adding new information or pressure. While individual descriptions are often evocative, the overall piece would benefit from more syntactic variety and concision.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it suffers from some scaffolding and redundancy. Phrases like "An insight began to form" and "The pieces were falling into place" are clichés that tell the reader an epiphany is occurring. The repeated parallels (river=bonds, foam=polymers, etc.) become slightly overwrought, and the final paragraphs are stylistically flat, summarizing events with a loss of the momentum and sensory detail established in the ravine scene.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. However, there are minor artifacts that dull the craft. The phrase "mindfully scattered" is repeated verbatim, feeling like a tic rather than a purposeful motif. The final paragraph veers slightly into summary, using phrases like "finally understood" and "the certainty that," which slightly reduces the immediacy of the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clear but weakened by a significant prose artifact: the exact phrase "sturdy... brittle" is repeated four times, which feels mechanical and forced. This repetition, along with some minor paraphrase loops, detracts from the overall elegance of the writing. While functional, the line-level craft lacks the propulsion and polish expected at the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it is weakened by a reliance on labeling and template cadences. Phrases like "passionate yet gentle, firm yet forgiving, energized yet warm" follow a repetitive syntactic structure that feels artificial. The story leans on adjectival descriptions of character traits instead of dramatizing them, which acts as a form of scaffolding that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is lyrical but suffers from significant repetition and scaffolding. Key phrases like "helix-minded," "chaotically precise," and "quaking reverie" are used as recurring motifs but become loops that reduce momentum. This repetition creates a template-cadence effect. Several sentences state thematic connections directly ("The transformation happening within them mirrored the profound transformation of the world"), which is less effective than showing this link through action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose suffers from severe and pervasive text artifacts, primarily the repetitive use of the same half-dozen keywords and phrases throughout the narrative. This creates numerous paraphrase loops where information is restated without advancement, severely damaging momentum and clarity. The writing is functionally clear but lacks concision and elegance due to this extreme redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but its high density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwriting. Phrases like "whispered secrets," "constant ember," and "prisms of sound" are effective individually but create a slightly crowded texture when clustered. There are also minor redundancies, such as "lived and breathed" after establishing the wood was from a living tree.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from significant structural repetition, which constitutes a major text artifact. The phrase "Elias was thoughtfully precise..." is used verbatim three times, creating a jarring template cadence. This, along with other near-duplicate phrases ("The eclipsed covenant had...", "The motivation that..."), measurably dulls momentum and signals a lack of sentence-level variety, significantly impacting the overall craft.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, with a strong sense of rhythm. The language effectively conveys the mystical, scientific nature of Elara's work. A minor weakness is a tendency toward slightly over-written conceptual phrases ("ultimate classification of quiet moments," "intuitively descriptive phrases that only made sense in her singular philosophy") that summarize more than they show, creating small pockets of momentum drag in an otherwise propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often elegant, with varied sentence structures and strong imagery. There are no significant grammatical errors or confusing constructions. A minor weakness is the repetition of abstract, lyrical phrases ("undercurrent of wisdom," "serenity within motion") that serve as thematic signposts but lack concrete grounding, bordering on becoming a scaffold for the story's ideas rather than emerging from them.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and contains some strong imagery, such as rivers like "silver serpents." However, it occasionally slips into overwriting and cliché ("deafening void," "throbbed with ancient power"). The repeated use of "whirling silence" becomes a crutch rather than an effective motif, and a few sentences rely on telling emotion rather than showing it through concrete action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers severely from repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops, particularly with the required elements. Phrases like "cultivate foresight in action" and "rapidly adapting" are reused verbatim, creating a scaffold-like structure that dulls momentum. This text-artifact issue is pervasive and makes the writing feel programmatic rather than organic, especially when these phrases appear in the final, critical paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is often elegant but is hampered by occasional overwriting and redundancy. A paraphrase loop occurs when describing how the aurora guides Eira's hands, momentarily stalling momentum. More critically, the climax is summarized rather than dramatized, with the narration explaining the crowd's reaction instead of letting the "sculpted hush" work on its own terms.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, but hampered by repetition and occasional overwriting. The phrase "avalanchingly quiet" appears three times, diminishing its impact. The final paragraph shifts into abstract summary ("washing away months of accumulated guilt," "he had been tragically mistaken"), which dulls the immediacy of the character's transformation and feels less crafted than the descriptive work earlier in the story.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, with a confident rhythm and strong imagery. However, there is some conceptual redundancy, with phrases like "mathematics of emotion," "grand equation of feeling," and "cosmic equation" circling the same idea. The expository blocks, while structurally permissible, favor summary over dramatization, slightly dulling the immediacy of Elara's internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, particularly in its descriptions of the setting and the pendant. However, the final paragraphs become overly abstract and reliant on conceptual nouns ("possibility," "confidence," "wonder," "magic") which dulls the impact of the closing images. The line stating her confidence "replacing the jitters" is a prose artifact that summarizes instead of showing, weakening the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is clear but suffers from significant scaffold and loop artifacts. Key phrases are repeated verbatim across paragraphs, functioning like checklist items rather than organic prose ("when assumptions shatter," "through the patterns in frost on a car window," etc.). This repetition creates a template-cadence feel that slows momentum and reduces information density. While grammatically clean, the line-level craft lacks the concision and elegance expected for publication due to these structural redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often evocative, the prose tends toward overwriting and abstraction, particularly with phrases like "hush of time's unraveling tapestry that had begun to fray at the edges of reality." The final paragraphs abandon concrete imagery for summary, describing the return of sound rather than rendering it. This reliance on telling over showing at the climax dulls the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean but exhibits some minor artifacts. There is a paraphrase loop early in the second half ("worked with a newfound precision... His hands moved with purpose"), which is redundant. The final two paragraphs are almost entirely summary, which stalls momentum and feels like authorial scaffolding explaining the story's meaning rather than letting the final image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, but it's held back by noticeable repetition and scaffolding. The phrase "cyclically and spontaneous" is repeated verbatim, and variations of "half-remembered dreams/murmurs" appear multiple times, creating a slight loop. Sentences like "This was weaving between worlds, a concept they had only read about..." function as expositional scaffolding that momentarily stalls the forward momentum of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. However, there are a few moments of slight overwriting and summary that stand out against the otherwise stellar craft. The phrase "luminescent ache" is repeated, and the final paragraphs contain summary-like sentences that paraphrase the emotional shift ("The anonymous chain had welcomed him into something larger than himself..."), momentarily breaking the "show, don't tell" discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose is often evocative and rhythmically controlled, its quality is severely undermined by a glaring textual corruption ("室白鲟") in a high-pressure beat. Such an artifact is more than a typo; it's a breakdown of the text's integrity that stalls momentum and signals a lack of polish. This single error, due to its placement and nature, imposes a heavy penalty on an otherwise strong piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there are moments where strategic telling slips into scaffolding, such as "It was with a mixture of scientific precision and artistic intuition that he finally discovered the pattern," which summarizes the breakthrough rather than dramatizing it. This slightly flattens the momentum leading into the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is frequently beautiful and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. A few minor flaws prevent a higher score: the cliché of "a stark contrast to the profound silence," and the convoluted syntax of the trigger moment ("...a pin was heard... when a droplet... struck..."). These small imprecisions, while not fatal, are noticeable blemishes on an otherwise polished surface.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it is weakened by conceptual redundancy. The idea of connection that "knits communities together" is stated in nearly identical phrasing multiple times, including in the final sentence. This paraphrase loop dulls the impact of the closure, creating a sense of scaffold where a sharp, final image should stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is clean, it suffers from significant conceptual looping. The terms "paradox," "contradiction," and "nested" are repeated to the point of redundancy, creating synonym churn that dulls momentum. The final paragraphs revert to summary, restating what has already been established instead of ending on a sharp, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally clean, evocative, and demonstrates good rhythmic control. However, the momentum is occasionally stalled by abstract labels that replace concrete embodiment, most notably "tenuous absolution" and "heuristically gentle." While there are no significant structural artifacts like loops or scaffolds, these moments of abstract overwriting prevent the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose contains some strong, evocative phrases ("time itself seemed crystallized"). However, it is critically undermined by pervasive, mechanical repetition of key phrases—"orderly records chief," "gently meticulous," "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion," "quartz hush." This looping creates a templated, artificial rhythm that dulls momentum and reads like a checklist, representing a significant flaw in line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, concise, and often evocative, with strong imagery like "a silence that screams." However, the repetition of key thematic phrases ("curiously steadfast," "comforting unease") feels slightly mechanical, as if echoing a prompt. The final paragraph, while effective, shifts slightly from showing to summarizing the outcome, which slightly flattens the momentum right at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong verbs and evocative sensory descriptions, particularly regarding taste. However, the piece is hampered by a significant text artifact: the phrase "terrestrially cosmic" is repeated five times, functioning as a conceptual loop that dulls momentum and reads as overwriting. This repetition, along with other keyword-like phrases, prevents the line-level craft from achieving the seamlessness required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and repetition that dulls its impact. The recurrence of key adjectives like "auroral" and "luminous" becomes an artifact, and conceptual loops appear, such as when the critic's quote is immediately paraphrased into abstract terms. These issues create drag and prevent the line-level craft from reaching an elite level.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery that carries momentum. Sentences like "her fingers leaving trails of liquid gold that cured permanently when she spoke her deepest truths aloud" demonstrate high-level craft. There are minor instances of scaffolding, such as summarizing an inference ("telling Elara that..."), which slightly dulls the immediacy but does not disrupt the overall quality.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often elegant. However, it relies heavily on abstract labels ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder," "resonant harmony") where concrete, sensory details would provide more impact. This reliance on abstraction keeps the reader at a distance, observing the concept rather than experiencing the story. The craft is solid, but it prioritizes poetic summary over visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and clear momentum. The primary weakness is in the final two paragraphs, which become redundant and expository, summarizing events and themes that have already been shown. This creates a paraphrase loop that dulls the impact of the closure, preventing the piece from achieving the flawless execution required for the highest scores.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and generally effective, but it often leans on sentimental abstractions ("connected him to the neighborhood's heart," "sanctuary of resistance") rather than sharper, more concrete imagery. There are instances of scaffolding that summarize the process ("The method of storytelling came naturally in this space...") instead of allowing the scene to do the work. The overall effect is pleasant but lacks the precision and density of top-tier prose.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often elegant, but it is marred by noticeable repetition artifacts. The simile "as a spider spins its web" is used twice, diminishing its impact. The phrase "mysterious familiarity" appears three times, functioning as a narrative scaffold rather than an organic observation. These conceptual loops, while thematically relevant, create a sense of mechanical construction that slightly dulls the story's otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery like "geometric crystals climbed the walls like frozen light." The rhythm is well-paced and supports the story's quiet, methodical tone. The one minor weakness is the four-fold repetition of the phrase "gleaming silence," which, while establishing a motif, borders on becoming a stylistic crutch by the final mention, slightly dulling its unique power.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is severely hampered by extensive repetition and scaffold-like phrasing, a critical flaw. Phrases like "solitary summoner," "quiet brook," "nocturnal haven," and "terrestrially cosmic" are reused to the point of becoming distracting text artifacts that dull momentum and read like template-filling. This looping pattern is the story's single greatest weakness, significantly undermining its literary quality despite its strong structure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates a good sense of rhythm. Momentum is well-maintained throughout. The primary weakness is a slight reliance on familiar phrasing and clichés ("spark of recognition," "grace that belied his years") that softens the impact of otherwise strong imagery and reduces the prose's overall specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but hampered by redundancy and a reliance on abstract noun phrases ("crystal resonance structures," "pure emotional resonance"). The final three paragraphs suffer from significant paraphrase loops, restating the story's resolution multiple times. This repetition dulls the momentum and impact of an otherwise strong closing beat, reading like authorial summary rather than confident scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it is marred by abstract, overwrought phrases ("calibrated treason," "wisely enduring reflection") and thematic summary that stalls momentum at the climax. The final two paragraphs, in particular, abandon scene work to explain the story's meaning, a significant craft issue. This reliance on telling over showing in pivotal moments is a primary weakness preventing the prose from reaching a publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=3.1)
    The prose suffers from severe and pervasive textual artifacts. At least eight unique, multi-word phrases are repeated verbatim three to five times each, creating a powerful "template-cadence" loop that stalls momentum and feels deeply artificial. This verbatim repetition is the story's most significant flaw, making it read like a structured summary rather than a living piece of fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and often beautiful, but it occasionally slips into overwriting and relies on a few key figurative phrases ("borrowed starlight") to the point of repetition. The final paragraphs become too abstract, summarizing action and theme rather than grounding the conclusion in a final, concrete moment ("healed a rupture between worlds... weaving truth carefully until it became something beautiful"). This prose artifact slightly dulls the otherwise sharp impact of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates a strong rhythmic control. However, there are moments of overwriting where "fine writing" intrudes, such as the slightly forced adverb in "scintillatingly somber." A more significant issue is the prose in the final paragraphs, which shifts from showing to summarizing the story's philosophy, losing momentum and clarity in favor of abstract explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and generally effective, but it relies on summary for the story's pivotal action of reassembling the letters ("For days, she worked..."). The repetition of "sharply observant" is a minor but noticeable text artifact that slightly dulls the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong, memorable phrases. However, the narrative relies heavily on summary and exposition rather than dramatized scenes. Key developments, such as the passage of years and the rise of the prophet, are told rather than shown, which flattens the story's momentum. Sentences frequently explain the premise rather than advancing the action within it.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it is weakened by a few noticeable flaws: the repetition of the phrase "positively wistful," a slightly cliché image ("dust motes dancing"), and a templated sentence structure in the final paragraph ("He had done...; he had captured..."). These artifacts, particularly the summary-like prose at the very end, dull the impact of an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clear and maintains momentum, but it is hampered by several text artifacts. Jargon-like phrases such as "sonic absolution" and "logically emotional" feel inserted rather than organic. There is a tendency towards adjectival density ("azure coat," "drift-ice marina," "frozen seaweed," "encroaching twilight") that occasionally clutters the lines. The climax contains a sentence that summarizes the character's internal state rather than showing it, slightly dulling the beat's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is lyrical and often precise, but it is weakened by conceptual redundancies and a tendency to summarize. Key phrases like "softly purposeful" and "restrained wildness" are repeated, and the latter half of the story relies on telling the reader about the revolution's impact rather than showing the immediate, personal result of the discovery. This dilutes the momentum and immediacy of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, moving the narrative forward with clarity. However, it sometimes defaults to summary over scene, particularly during moments of internal realization ("realizing the controlling influence she needed to escape encompassed more than just her immediate supervisor"). There are also minor redundancies, like the repeated use of "reverberate," that slightly dull the overall precision.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often evocative, with strong opening and closing lines. Sentences are well-structured and maintain momentum. There are minor instances of overwriting, such as the phrase "aptly deliberate," and the clunky transition "By the way light broke through storm clouds outside... he realized what he must do." While free of significant artifacts, the line-level craft doesn't consistently reach the exceptional sharpness required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose contains multiple distracting text artifacts, primarily paraphrase loops and repetitive phrasing that stall momentum. The phrase "steadily curious nature" appears three times in similar constructions, functioning as a scaffold rather than organic prose. This repetition, along with that of "yearning algorithm" and "irreverent awe," measurably dulls the narrative texture and signals an unpolished draft.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is clear and maintains momentum, with several strong images. However, it relies on a number of familiar sci-fi/noir metaphors ("ghosts in the machine," "digital labyrinth") and abstract emotional descriptors that could be sharpened. There's a slight tendency toward overwriting in moments of discovery, which slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise clean and functional line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains evocative imagery but is hampered by moments of abstraction and repetition. The key phrase "weighted breath" is used twice, diminishing its impact and feeling like a prose tic. Sentences like "this courageously anomalous act of reconstitution" are clunky and analytical, pulling the reader out of the scene with academic-style diction that clashes with the established tone.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often evocative and clear, with strong imagery in the first half. However, the final paragraphs become burdened with abstraction and conceptual restatement. There are minor paraphrase loops where the same realization is described in slightly different terms, which slows the momentum of the otherwise resonant ending and reads like scaffolding left in the final draft.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=3.2)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness, crippled by severe repetition and structural loops. Key phrases ("amber pavilion," "after the final bus departed," "drawing parallels," "gentle persuasion") are recycled to the point of becoming incantatory but ultimately hollow. This template-cadence approach, combined with adjacent sentences that merely paraphrase each other, drains the narrative of momentum and reads like a first draft in need of aggressive consolidation and variation.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness due to repetitive phrasing that reads as a text artifact. Key terms like "peripheral awareness," "kinetic parapet," and especially "conjured clearing" are looped to the point of distraction, dulling momentum and giving the piece a mechanical feel. This conceptual redundancy obscures the otherwise strong atmospheric writing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and clear but lacks the density and precision of top-tier work. There are several instances of conceptual repetition ("collective healing," "shared understanding") and the reuse of the label "earnest whimsy." The reliance on abstract nouns to carry emotional weight slightly softens the story's propulsion and specificity, particularly in moments of intended impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness due to severe and pervasive repetition. Key phrases ("shadowed library at dawn," "suspended hush," "weathered innocence," "testify through fractured sequences") are used like boilerplate, creating a distracting loop effect that stalls momentum. This text artifact reads like a template rather than organic prose, and its frequency fundamentally undermines the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean and evocative, with strong imagery that carries the story's atmospheric weight. The rhythm is generally well-controlled, avoiding significant overwriting or clutter. There is a minor recurrence of "As/With [action], [result]" sentence structures that creates a slightly mechanical cadence in places, preventing the prose from achieving flawless momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but suffers from overwriting and repetition of key thematic words. The phrase "luminous ache" is used twice in crucial moments, diminishing its power and reading like a prose artifact. Abstract descriptions like "ephemeral energies that leathered the boundaries" are awkward and obscure meaning rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. Sentences like "...breathing becomes the only metronome counting what's left" demonstrate masterful control. The score is slightly tempered by a high concentration of abstract figurative language ("scent of hope," "bridge between understanding," "ordinary magic") that, while tonally consistent, occasionally feels overwrought and borders on sentimentality in its clustering.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean but suffers from minor scaffolding and repetition. Phrases like "budding rune scholar" and "clockwork automaton key" are repeated to the point of becoming noticeable tics. Some sentences lean on generic constructions ("her fingers moving with a quietly deliberate precision"), slightly dulling the momentum in an otherwise well-paced narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. However, there are moments where the story leans on abstract labels ("nostalgic innovation," "shrewdly innocent approach") instead of letting the specifics do the work. The line "suddenly the garden's edges blurred" is a stock phrase that undercuts the power of a pivotal magical moment, and the final paragraphs contain summary statements that reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but minor artifacts prevent a top-tier score. Phrases like "pearl of stillness...like a perfect sphere of calm" contain redundancies. There are also occasional moments where the figurative language feels slightly overwrought ("zephyr bloom of inspiration"), slightly dulling the otherwise sharp and concise line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.2)
    While much of the prose is evocative, it is marred by abstract statements and conceptual redundancies that slow momentum. The final paragraphs contain several aphoristic sentences ("...truth-telling could grow from the most exposed parts of ourselves") that summarize the theme rather than letting the final image do the work. This tendency towards telling in key moments prevents the line-level craft from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose contains a critical flaw: excessive and near-verbatim repetition of key phrases ("lucidly watchful," "against the current," "swirling hush," etc.). This pattern reads as a mechanical insertion of required elements rather than organic motif work, creating distracting loops and a scaffold-like structure. While individual sentences are often well-crafted, this pervasive text artifact severely damages momentum and the overall craft, making the piece feel constructed and artificial, especially since the repetitions occur throughout, including at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and readable, but it relies on several repetitive phrases that create minor pattern artifacts. "Spun golden stories," "verdant arbor at dawn," and "gathering hush" are each used multiple times, which dulls their impact. Some emotional states are labeled ("Elara's heart ached") rather than embodied, softening the line-level propulsion in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally possesses a strong rhythmic quality. However, it is marred by moments of redundancy and abstraction that slow momentum. For instance, the paragraph explaining "moving stillness" paraphrases itself, and the line about items becoming "conduits for something greater... that transcended their humble origins" is an abstract summary rather than a sharp image. These small scaffoldings prevent the line-level craft from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, with a controlled rhythm that mirrors the protagonist's patient work. Sentences are well-crafted and the language is evocative, supporting the story's atmosphere. While the density of figurative language is very high, it remains coherent and stylistically consistent, avoiding outright flaws. The line-level craft is strong, with no technical errors, loops, or scaffolding to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the repeated use of the slightly clunky term "kerosene lamp burner" (instead of a more fluid alternative like "lamp" or "lantern") creates a minor rhythmic drag. A few constructions, like a thought "that settled like sediment in their mind," lean on familiar phrasing, representing small opportunities for greater sharpness in an otherwise excellent piece.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished to a high sheen, demonstrating exceptional clarity, concision, and information density. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, never devolving into overwriting; phrases like "rust-hued peace" and "menagerie of loss" are both beautiful and precise. There are no wasted words or movements, and the syntax and rhythm create a powerful, immersive reading experience without a single prose artifact to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it occasionally slips into overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and figurative language that can dull momentum. Phrases like "gloriously replaced by a liquid peace" feel slightly ornate. There are also moments of near-redundancy, such as describing his eroded ambitions in two similar ways. While the line-level craft is strong, it lacks the surgical precision and concision required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally free of grammatical errors. However, it suffers from some repetition and scaffolding. The phrase "maze of intentions" is used three times, and "functionally creative" twice, functioning more as prompt keywords than organic language. While the sentences are well-formed, they lack high information density and rhythmic variety, settling into a safe, declarative cadence that doesn't always match the wonder of the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often evocative, the prose is marred by significant repetition that dulls its impact. Key phrases like "excruciatingly gentle" (3x), "soundless sanctuary" (4x), and "crystal whispering forecourt after rain" (3x) are reused to the point of becoming noticeable text artifacts. This template-cadence pattern creates redundancy and prevents the piece from achieving the highest level of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from notable repetition and scaffolding that dulls momentum. Key phrases like "architecture of lies," "antique pocket sundial," and "errant legend seeker" are repeated three times each, functioning more like thematic tags than organic motifs. This conceptual redundancy, especially in such a short piece, creates a looping effect that feels programmatic and overwrites the subtler narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often beautiful, successfully building the story's quiet atmosphere. However, it relies on a few familiar phrases ("weathered hands," "rough as driftwood") and tends to label key emotions ("felt a thrill," "felt infinitely patient"). The final image of the fog parting is powerful but slightly overwrought, stating its symbolic meaning a little too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often elegant, but suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought. Furthermore, there are minor conceptual loops, such as the repetition of the "geography of healing" idea. These prose artifacts slightly dull the momentum and clarity, preventing the line-level craft from reaching an elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clear and functional, but diminished by several artifacts that dull its impact. The repetitive use of "hypothesize" feels mechanical, and stock phrases like "bitter taste of failure" lean on cliché. Most significantly, the final thematic explanation stalls the story's momentum, shifting from dramatization into summary at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is often evocative and clear, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from several instances of thematic and descriptive repetition that act as scaffolding. The phrase "scars can sing" appears three times, and "gracefully alert" is used twice, creating paraphrase loops that dull momentum. This redundancy, especially with the core theme, suggests a lack of trust in the dramatized action to carry the meaning on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clean and rhythmic, but it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting with stacked, abstract descriptors ("luminous skeptic," "realistically imaginative," "sidereal patience"). Some key moments are told rather than shown, such as when her skepticism is "replaced by certainty." This reliance on conceptual labels over concrete, sensory action dulls the immediacy of the climax and feels less propulsive than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is often elegant, but it is severely hampered by extensive repetition of key phrases ("approximating infinity," "share light without using fire," etc.). These recurrences function as paraphrase loops and create a template-like cadence that dulls the momentum and diminishes the impact of the imagery, especially by the story's end. This prose artifact measurably weakens the otherwise strong craft.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are occasional moments of abstraction that tell rather than show the effect, such as describing the carving as capturing "both individual sorrow and shared human experience." A few sentences summarize states of being rather than embodying them, slightly slowing the momentum. Overall the craft is very high, but a final polish could heighten its immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and functional but becomes bogged down by abstraction and summary in the final third. Lines like "incremental absolution wove itself into their collective work" are less effective than the concrete actions they describe. The final paragraph, in particular, is a sequence of summary sentences that repeat the theme rather than letting the final image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative and generally clean, but it occasionally lapses into summary or telling where showing would be more powerful (e.g., "His motivation went beyond mere curiosity..."). There are minor paraphrase loops that slightly dampen momentum. The primary flaw is the thematic statement in the final paragraph, which feels like an authorial intrusion on an otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is clean and grammatically sound, it suffers from significant conceptual redundancy. The story repeatedly rephrases Elara's core function in slightly different terms, creating paraphrase loops that slow the momentum (e.g., explaining her predictive modeling twice). This explanatory scaffolding detracts from the story's propulsion, telling the reader the same information instead of moving forward.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is often beautiful and evocative. However, the story's momentum is significantly damaged by the structural choice to place a long expository section near the end. This multi-paragraph block functions as a summary that stalls the narrative after its peak, violating the principle of maintaining propulsion. Additionally, a few phrases like "Her motivation was simple yet profound" read as authorial scaffolding rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often elegant, but it's hampered by conceptual redundancy. Several ideas are stated and then paraphrased in slightly different terms within a few paragraphs (e.g., the function of "incomplete information"). This creates loops that slow momentum. For instance, the sentence "Weaving truth carefully had become her life's work..." restates an idea presented earlier, slightly dulling the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is hampered by significant repetition of key phrases. Terms like "sedimentary layers," "competing narratives," "rationally rebellious," and "abrasive calm" are used multiple times, functioning more as thematic signposts than as organic language. This prose artifact creates noticeable loops that slow momentum and give the story a slightly formulaic feel, as if ticking off required elements. This is the primary flaw holding the piece back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from notable redundancy and thematic looping. Key concepts like "braiding voices" and the power of music over words are restated in slightly different phrasing across multiple paragraphs, lowering the information density. This paraphrase-looping ("Music has the power to denote what words cannot express," then "music builds bridges where words fail") reads like authorial scaffolding that should have been edited out.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    While much of the prose is evocative and clean, the story is marred by several significant prose artifacts that halt momentum. The explanatory sentence detailing "synaptic plasticity" reads like an encyclopedia entry, and summary phrases like "his informally wise nature" are scaffolding that should have been removed. These slips, though infrequent, are noticeable flaws in an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clean and competent, establishing a solid atmosphere early on. However, pivotal moments of character revelation rely on summary and telling over showing, particularly the block of narration explaining the supervisor's motives. This expository turn slows momentum and lessens the impact of the discovery, trading scene-level tension for efficient explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is elegant and evocative for the first two-thirds, the ending suffers from significant scaffolding and summary. The line "In that moment, Aria understood:" signals a shift from showing to telling, and the final paragraph is a redundant explanation of the climax. This paraphrasing loop dulls the impact of the final image and slows momentum where it should be most resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. However, the repeated use of the phrase "thread... through the structural weakness" across different contexts feels like a thematic hammer rather than an organic motif, creating a slight template-cadence artifact. This conceptual loop, while thematically central, reduces the sense of organic discovery in the language itself.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, but it is significantly weakened by prominent text artifacts. Key phrases from the prompt are repeated to the point of becoming scaffolds: "grim optimism" (4x), "balancedly daring" (3x), "perpetual motion" (4x), "rupture" (5x). This synonym churn and conceptual looping dulls momentum and makes the prose feel constructed rather than organic, a notable flaw in an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong images like the "mural of forgotten languages... flowing together like tributaries of a great river." However, there are moments of abstraction and summary that dilute the immediacy, such as "Each symbol with its specific meaning was a testimony to her theory." This tendency to explain the significance of her actions, rather than letting the actions themselves convey it, represents a minor but persistent drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, it occasionally borders on being overwritten with its high frequency of adjectives ("cultured museum guide," "emerald-tinted opera glass lens," "familiar green hue," "cavernous expanse"). The repetition of "historically oriented" is a minor stumble, a moment of telling over showing. Despite these slight instances of overwriting, the overall craft is exceptionally high, and the rhythm and clarity are maintained even in its densest passages.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.2)
    While generally clean, the prose suffers from several noticeable text artifacts. The exact phrases "neatly inventive" and "bleak exhilaration" are each repeated, creating a looping effect that dulls their impact. There is also a tendency toward abstract summary ("Others had called her obsession... but Esme understood") where more embodied action would have increased momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong imagery in the first half. However, the final paragraphs become didactic and lose momentum, shifting from dramatization to conceptual summary ("transformation itself, beautiful precisely because it terrifies us into growth"). This shift into essayistic language at the climax dulls the impact of the otherwise clean line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with elegant phrasing and vivid imagery. However, the prose is hampered by conceptual redundancy, where the core theme is paraphrased multiple times, creating a subtle loop that dulls momentum. There is also a tendency toward a uniform sentence structure in places, which could be varied for greater rhythmic impact. These issues prevent the otherwise polished prose from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clear and largely concise, but it occasionally relies on summarizing key moments instead of rendering them in scene. For instance, "His father's final entry spoke of the terrible truth" tells us the outcome of the discovery rather than immersing us in the act of reading and realization. While free of major artifacts, the prose lacks the consistent information density and propulsion of truly exceptional work.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and clear but suffers from a lack of propulsion due to frequent abstract declarations and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "recapture the truth...a truth deliberately obscured" and "deception following deception" create paraphrase loops that slow momentum. The language favors telling over showing, relying on academic summary rather than sharp, concrete imagery to convey the stakes and discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often elegant, the prose is hampered by a reliance on abstract conceptual nouns ("interlaced absence," "archive of human desire") that feel like scaffolding. This tendency toward overwriting slightly dulls momentum and clarity where more concrete, sensory language would have had greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and clear but is significantly hampered by repetitive phrasing that functions as a prose artifact. The recurrence of phrases like "tranquilly perceptive" (3 times), "dappled resolve" (2 times), and "reclaimed stillness" (3 times) creates a template-like cadence that dulls momentum and feels overly constructed. While the sentences are grammatically sound, these loops prevent the prose from achieving genuine flow and elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is elegant, but it suffers from a few conceptual loops that dull momentum. The idea of "descends while ascending" is stated explicitly twice, once for the basilica and once for the character, which reads as a paraphrase loop. While the language is often beautiful, some sentences are over-adorned with figurative language, slightly reducing the clarity and propulsion of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive. However, it suffers from noticeable repetition and scaffold phrases. Key concepts like "bleak exhilaration," "intangibly tangible," "unfiltered awakening," and "perturbation theory" are repeated verbatim, functioning as labels rather than being described with fresh language. This creates a loop-like quality that dulls momentum and gives the prose a slightly artificial, templated feel, particularly the dual use of "intangibly tangible" which reads as a clunky artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and generally propulsive, but it's hampered by repetitive phrasing and a reliance on abstract descriptors. The phrase "brilliant dimness" is effective once but loses impact with its third repetition. Similarly, "perpetually surprised" becomes a noticeable verbal tic. There are minor instances of scaffolding and stock phrasing ("hummed with hidden power," "shimmered with potential") that soften the line-level precision expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is lyrical and precise for the most part, with strong imagery ("sieved hush," "cobalt terrace"). However, there are minor but noticeable prose artifacts, including the repetition of key phrases like "sieved hush" and "tempered regret," and a conceptual loop around the word "weight." While the writing is high-quality, these redundancies create a slight echo that keeps the line-level craft just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, especially in its descriptions of the setting. However, it is hampered by several instances of telling over showing (e.g., "Lyra was known as uncommonly thoughtful") and some conceptual redundancy. The repeated articulation of the core theme in slightly different phrasing creates paraphrase loops that slow the momentum and reduce information density, particularly near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery like the "heavy cloak of her regrets." However, there are occasional lapses into cliché ("flimsy houses of cards") or abstract phrasing ("gravitate her toward some form of reckoning") that soften the impact. While free of major artifacts, the line-level craft doesn't maintain the highest level of precision and density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is generally clear, but it is significantly weakened by recurring textual artifacts. The phrase "delicately robust" is used three times, which feels like a conspicuous authorial imposition rather than a natural part of the character's thought process. This repetition, combined with a tendency toward abstract conceptual language ("nature of reality," "labyrinth of choices," "earth's embrace"), creates a slight narrative distance and dulls the immediacy of the prose, preventing it from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and clean, with strong imagery like "pools of night sky filled with swirling constellations." The rhythm and sentence structure support the magical atmosphere without significant flaws. A few phrases lean towards cliché ("tremor in her heart") or conceptual summary ("transformed yet fundamentally unchanged"), slightly dulling the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains beautiful, evocative phrases ("drink the moonlight," "specimens in the amber of time"). Unfortunately, the final third is marred by significant paraphrase loops, restating the central epiphany multiple times with slightly different wording. This redundancy dulls the momentum and clarity of the closure, making the ending feel padded and less impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely free of mechanical errors. Sentences like "hope blossomed within their heart like a flower after endless winter" are effective, if familiar. There are minor instances where conceptual density feels more explanatory than purely narrative, such as defining shadow work in-line, slightly slowing the momentum of an otherwise propulsive final sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from repetition and conceptual loops, particularly in the final third. Phrases like "vibrant hush" and "whispering hush" are used interchangeably, and the thematic realization is restated across multiple sentences. This redundancy slows the momentum and dulls the sharpness of the otherwise strong closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is ambitious but marred by a critical, immersion-shattering error: the random insertion of the Chinese characters "联络." This represents a catastrophic failure in proofreading that would require immediate correction before any consideration for publication. Beyond this, the prose occasionally relies on repetitive thematic labels ("calm inventiveness," "winking hush") instead of letting the qualities emerge purely from action.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise for most of the story, with strong verbs and concrete imagery. However, the final two paragraphs shift into summary, telling the reader about the character's newfound peace and fulfilled promise rather than showing it through a final, resonant image or action. This robs the ending of some of its potential momentum and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from an over-density of figurative language. Nearly every sentence in some paragraphs contains a simile or metaphor. This stylistic choice, while creating a rich texture, borders on overwriting and slightly impedes momentum, as the reader must constantly pause to process another comparison rather than being carried forward by the action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is articulate but often overwrought, relying on abstract conceptual phrases like "prismatic chaos" and "dignified chaos." While evocative, this tendency toward high-level descriptors at key moments can feel ornate rather than sharp. Sentences occasionally lack propulsion due to their abstract construction, slightly dulling the momentum of an otherwise focused scene.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and memorable phrasing. However, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally risks tipping into overwriting, with some metaphors feeling slightly ornamental rather than essential ("fallen pages like fallen comrades"). While the rhythm and word choice are generally excellent, a few more moments of plainer language could have provided contrast and made the most powerful images land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, there are moments of slight authorial intrusion and template phrasing, such as the repeated label "strategically creative" and a run of "He [verb]..." sentences in the middle section that briefly flattens the momentum. These instances, while not pervasive, keep the line-level craft just shy of flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is generally clear and competent, with a decent rhythm. However, there are instances of overwriting and redundancy, with some phrases restating what is already implied (e.g., the seed's glow is described multiple times in similar terms). The final sentence is long and convoluted, burdened with summarizing the theme rather than providing a crisp, final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often elegant, the prose is burdened by a high density of adjectives that sometimes feels overwrought. More critically, the phrase "RBG hands" is a severe flaw; it is nonsensical within the story's world, breaking tone and immersion at a key emotional moment. This unforced error suggests a need for a rigorous line edit to match the ambition of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong cadence and sensory density, yet occasional stacked modifiers (“tragically radiant with eyes that held…”) create micro-clutter. No loops or scaffold; metaphors remain coherent. One mixed moment: “ghostly resolve” verges on abstraction mid-climax.

    Sentences carry dual load of precision and atmospheric charge. Occasional modifier stacks (“intangibly tangible”) ride on edge of muddle but remain motivated by the conceptual object. No outright loops except the echo “bleak exhilaration”. Strong sensory specificity: “air thick with ozone and decay” lands clear and urgent.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; only minor filter-verb clusters (“he recalled,” “he remembered”) in reflective block. No mixed metaphors or loops. High information density throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is selective and purposeful. One mixed metaphor—“mist swirled like forgotten ghosts”—is borderline, but clarity is preserved. High information density without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is mostly fleet and specific, marred only by two mild filter-verb patches (“she felt the heavy cloak…”) and a near-cliché “houses of cards”. No major loop dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic, but occasional stacked modifiers (“delicately robust baseball”) flirt with overwriting; no loops or scaffold, and the final paragraph’s cadence lands with earned poise.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; each sentence advances image or stakes. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is purposeful (“pools of night sky”). Minor register lift in “cosmic intimacy” is earned by prior lyric pattern. Final line anchors closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is lush yet disciplined; occasional stacked metaphors (“amber of time,” “choking beauty”) risk overwriting but never obscure causality. Rhythm breathes with scene needs; no loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; occasional elevated phrasing (“luminous understanding”) is earned by context. No loops or scaffold; each sentence advances image or stakes. One mixed metaphor (“flower after endless winter”) is minor.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive; no loops or scaffold. Occasional elevated diction (“luminous fort,” “cradle of sparks”) stays within character lens. Metaphors are coherent; no mixed vehicles. Sentence variety supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense but purposeful; each sentence layers action, image, and concept. No loops or scaffold; rhythm breathes with ritual pacing. Metaphors (“borrowed dawn”) are consistent and earned. Minor elevated diction (“conceptual repricing” risk) is voice-motivated and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    No prose loops or scaffold, but "cathedral" metaphor slightly strains credibility; rhythmic control excels in the butterfly emergence scene, with concrete verbs ("damp," "cracked") enhancing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion but "drifting resonance" verbatim repetition in paragraphs 4 and 8 triggers paraphrase-loop penalty; frost pattern descriptions risk figurative density in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong rhythm and specificity except adjacent paraphrase loop: "unshaken marvels of their own creation" followed by "unshaken marvels of nature" triggers -0.2; minor scaffold in backstory summary avoids closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose achieves high density with zero scaffold—"each bundle contained just enough" compresses scarcity and generosity—while "amplified quiet" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor tell in "Elias believed" slightly dilutes momentum but avoids full explanatory interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; "pearl-like drop holding compassion" is minor figurative muddle (contradicting tear's liquid nature) in peak beat, costing -0.3. Otherwise immaculate propulsion: "breath patterns shifted" syntax mirrors her changing state without filter-verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("terrifying yet intoxicating") and abstract phrasing in temporal sequences reduce propulsion. Strong opening anchors but final disintegration lacks textural grit; no critical artifacts, yet density wavers near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Her motivation burned bright" slightly abstract; "staggering grace" risks overuse but redeems in closure. Minor scaffold in "Being patiently strategic had kept her alive," though redeemed by tactical payoff. Propulsion strong, but two near-duplicate openings ("She was...") dilute momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold in climax but "cells divided" creates synonym churn with cancer diagnosis. Minor density issue: "battered marvel" refrain risks template cadence though payoff justifies repetition. Final image crystalline with no figurative muddle despite high lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Luminous disbelief" recurs verbatim in critical beats (theft/workshop), creating scaffold loops that dull immediacy. Otherwise vivid prose with strong verbs ("vanished," "danced") and purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero scaffold loops, but "thoughtfully spirited" repeats 4x with synonym churn (-0.3); high-density prose ("dripped rhythmically against corroded metal, becoming both metronome and accompaniment") drives momentum without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    No major loops, but "trembling certainty" repetition and "heart pounding" cliché slightly dilute propulsion; final line avoids sentimentality with concrete action ("pressed seashell against her heart").

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion; only paraphrase loop ("fingers tracing... fingers moved") and borderline mixed metaphor ("profound silence and whispers") trigger -0.3. Figurative language serves pressure without muddle, especially in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion, though "sensation it registered as almost spiritual" slightly drifts from concrete embodiment in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with clear propulsion; "tales of love, betrayal, hope, and regret" avoids listiness through concrete verbs. Weakness: "cryptic doodles" repetition (4x) creates subtle paraphrase loop without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Garden was blooming withering" syntax awkwardness and two minor paraphrase loops ("transformation... turning flaws," "concealed... deception") slightly dull closure's cadence without breaking momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "obliging soul... obliging sky mechanic" and "subdued awakenings" repetition; no fatal artifacts, but "velocity of discovery" in final beat risks purple prose without sufficient payoff in closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely propulsion-focused ("Elias carefully lifted the program, noticing how the stains formed..."), but "shift and change" shows slight redundancy. Final line ("completing the conversation that silence had interrupted") delivers high density without muddle. No loops or scaffold, though "miraculously untouched" risks overwriting without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "snow blown through compromised window seal" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor figurative muddle: "crystallized fragment... pulsed with auroral sorrow" slightly strains physics logic. Final line’s cadence shift ("impossibly light and heavy as mountains") delivers propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose largely clean with high density ("brass surface glinting like lost treasure"), but scaffold phrase "his motivation wasn’t fame or fortune" interrupts momentum. No loops, though "drowsy alertness" repetition lacks deepening in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose achieves high density and propulsion, but template cadence emerges in the opening ("Sunlight fractured... Their grip... Across the drift...") with three consecutive subject-verb openings, dulling initial momentum without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor metaphor clash ("resilience wasn't about strength but flexibility, bending without breaking like sagebrush"); otherwise clean propulsion with zero loops, though "cautious exuberance" edges toward therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.2)
    Overwriting in key beats: "fragile as moth wings," "reality to thin at the edges," and "bronze quality" cluster in the diary discovery scene, diluting emotional impact. Figurative density crosses into muddle without pattern-teaching, violating peak-beat clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density overall, but adjacent lines like "truths hiding in plain sight... open secrets that permeated" create paraphrase loops. Overwriting in "palimpsest of destinies" slightly muddles the spy specs' function. Final line achieves resonant propulsion without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Paraphrase loop in "unraveled stillness" (repeated verbatim 3x) and "plumb the depths" redundancy dull momentum; otherwise crisp propulsion with strong verbs ("writhed," "flared," "dissolve") supporting Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with minimal loops; "exhaustion" paraphrase cycle ("creeping... waning... claimed him") incurs -0.3 Non-closure Accumulation Cap. Figurative language remains clear and pressure-appropriate throughout peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful figurative language ("fracture like shattering glass"), but paraphrase loop in emotional description ("darkening brightness matched emotional state"/"paradoxical sensation") dulls climax momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose excels in textural specificity ("fractured needle," "stone floor vibrations") but minor scaffold appears in adjacent "faint rustle of turning seasons" repetitions dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero scaffold loops in climax; "burdened not by physical mass" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor deduction for three repetitions of "nurture integrity in solitude" creating paraphrase loops that dilute momentum in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere (e.g., "cobalt glass casting crystal shadows" evolves meaning). Figurative language ("constellations coming into sight") serves clarity in peak beats, with final line resonating through concrete action: "navigating their own darkness."

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Near-zero loops but minor scaffold: "By uncovering layers..." repeats with slight variation. "Passionate subtlety" edges toward abstraction, though final image avoids muddle. No closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.4)
    Paraphrase loop early ("What he lacked in sound... detecting vibrations others could never hear") triggers -0.2. Otherwise clean propulsion, but "simple yet profound tales" is vague abstraction; final paragraph's "unfinished masterpiece" borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; high density ("fragrance chemist's blotter petals, each holding emotional signature" does triple duty). Rhythm accelerates during transformation ("fingers tingling"), breathes in reflection. Final line recharges motif without muddle—"carefully crafted half truths" crystallizes conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold: "worn golden locket" simultaneously establishes character (mentor's token), setting (sea-tarnished), and theme (preservation). Sentence rhythm accelerates during Elias' realization ("cargo broker mind already calculating...") then breathes for the locket reveal. Final image—"locket now housed three photos"—avoids figurative muddle with crystalline specificity that recharges the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose flows with high density ("spirals and arches from pliant stems"), but "webs of kinship" appears as label before embodiment, and "boldly sympathetic regard" verges on abstraction. No loops dull closure, though minor scaffold weakens the kinship motif’s integration in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion with minimal scaffold. Minor density dip in chamber description ("walls vibrated with suppressed sound") slightly dulls closure beat momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "murmuring equations that described sorrow, joy, love, and hope as elements in a grand formula" doing triple duty; no figurative muddle despite lyrical intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero figurative muddle but "kindly methodical" repetition (3x) creates subtle synonym churn; no closure-dulling artifacts yet density slightly flags in reflection block.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("doubled in size," "trembling hands"). Minor deduction for "her motivation had shifted" telling rather than showing, but final image avoids sentimentality through concrete setup.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean syntax with purposeful variation, but synonym loops weaken momentum: "fragmented memories" (para 1) echoes "fragmented corridors" (para 3). Final paragraph slightly overwrites ("testament to possibilities beyond destruction"), though closure imagery ("hands steady") remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops in "steady predictability vanished, replaced by steadily unpredictable" and "crystallized within her mind" cliché; final paragraph's density borders on overwriting without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.7)
    No closure-dulling artifacts, but verbatim repetition of "Through staggered intervals" creates a paraphrase loop; otherwise exemplary density ("pristine but painful emptiness" compresses theme and setting).

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.1)
    Scaffold loops in climax ("trembling certainty" repeated verbatim) and drumbeat rhythm in final paragraph ("would... would... would") dilute propulsion; otherwise high-density imagery supports Accumulative escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with clear propulsion, but adjacent paraphrase loop ("Through forgotten patterns she recognized..."/"Through forgotten patterns she documented...") triggers -0.2. Final image avoids overwriting, yet "courageously kind" tells rather than shows. Prevents 9.0+ but strong for band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density with "solar storm's magnetic fields reaching tendrils" doing triple duty. Minor deduction for "hushed thunder" metaphor repeating without evolution and "universe forever changed" bordering on generic in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "patterns formed and reformed like liquid thoughts." Strategic telling compresses planning without losing momentum. Minor "mathematics" cliché redeemed by context.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "refracted into a spectrum" avoids figurative muddle. Opening anchors voice/stakes ("gilded-leaf stationer sat... amidst blooming labyrinth"), final line recharges "textures" motif. Minor deduction for "incandescent restraint" slightly abstracting physical cost.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves high density with "sweet then gone without trace," yet adjacent paraphrase in "tides dictate my existence... rhythm of tides" creates minor scaffold. No closure artifacts, but two template cadence runs in mid-section dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lyrical yet propelled by strong verbs ("lightning flashed," "needle spun"), though "gloomy cheerfulness" repetition creates a minor scaffold loop in high-pressure beats, slightly dulling closure’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("splashed," "nailing"), but scaffold appears in early sequential "Maya adjusted... Maya paused... Maya clutched" phrasing. No closure-dulling artifacts; final line's "spiral inside a circle" delivers crystalline specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Paraphrase loops weaken propulsion: "dawning hush" repeats four times with near-identical phrasing in high-pressure beats. Strong verbs ("disintegrating," "crystallized") elevate imagery, but scaffold phrasing dilutes the climax's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor template cadence ("Elias positioned... Elias thought... Elias worked") in para 3. Otherwise exemplary propulsion: "crystal bowl of water" sentence integrates setting/action/theme. Zero loops in peak repair beat.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("worrying tranquility" verbatim repeat) and stock phrase ("methodical grace") slightly dull momentum. High density maintained, but filter-verb stack ("watched," "wondering," "moved") in falcon scene triggers -0.3 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fractured windowpane fused, cracks spiderwebbing backwards into wholeness") with clear propulsion, though "bruised sky" edges toward cliché; no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Two paraphrase loops ("crushing pressure... passing centuries" → "crushing finality") and one template cadence run. No figurative muddle in peak beats, but scaffold prevents 8.8+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.7)
    Three "hovering" repetitions in adjacent paragraphs create template cadence; "sustains impossibilities" phrasing drifts into abstract diction during high-pressure beats, diluting momentum despite otherwise vivid textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose loops ("overlapping" x4) and overwritten closure ("thread and needle, with dreams and determination") dull momentum. Orchid solace repetition in final beats creates scaffold; rhythmic monotony undermines peak emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor overwriting ("grotesque yet beautiful dance") and a paraphrase loop in "reverent way his fingers traced its ancient markings" dull closure proximity; density remains high but prevents 9+ despite strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "ghostly traces visible to those who knew how to look" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting in "ethereal warmth that reminded her of stories" risks abstraction but avoids muddling closure's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("prismatic tears" compresses light/weather/emotion). Strategic telling compresses transit ("by morning, her work was complete"). Final line's "infinite tapestry" recharges "star-flecked fabric" without figurative muddle, though "adjacent possibilities" slightly strains lexicon in one beat.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density falters in final beats: "fierce tenderness" repeats 3x with near-synonym phrasing ("blooming within her"), creating a paraphrase loop that dulls closure’s charge. Otherwise clean propulsion; "condensation transformed into letters" avoids filter verbs. No figurative muddle, but repetition triggers -0.3 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with dual-purpose lines ("anesthetic still smoothing her brow" implying medical/psychic state) but "lotus-hearted ache" is stock phrasing in high-pressure beat. Zero loops; final line recharges coral motif.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful specificity ("baskets overflowing with fruit"), though "documented each revelation, building a knowledge network" introduces scaffold that dilutes momentum in a critical beat without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lyrical but subtle scaffold appears: "nested awakenings compounded" feels thematic rather than character-driven, and repetitive cadence in revelation beats slightly dulls momentum near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "vibrations carried encoded message through soil's mycelial network" achieves high density with rhythmic propulsion. Minor register drift in "converging chaos" (para 4, 12) but payoff in closure image justifies usage.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops but "shyly unstoppable" repeats as template cadence (3x) in high-pressure beats (-0.4). Figurative density ("galaxy postcard... tears from distant worlds") risks muddle yet clears payoff. Final image propulsion strong.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion: zero loops/scaffold, high density ("resonated with forgotten names" → "melodies evaporated like dew"). "Tears like tiny glass orchids unfurling" avoids figurative muddle; only minor label ("foxglove regret") in Q1 context.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym churn in ink well descriptions ("crystal surface reflecting," "seemed to glow") and repetitive "restore trust" phrasing dull momentum, though rhythm supports tension.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density ("slyly heartfelt message disguised as technical specifications" does triple duty) but paraphrase loop: "fingers trembled as she measured angles" followed by "tremors through her hands" three lines later dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("rumpled parchment/vintage bookshop attic" anchors voice). Minor overwriting risk in "extraterrestrial mysteries that seemed to call her name" but motif payoff justifies it. Final image's "ancient blue" avoids purple prose through earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=6.7)
    Template cadence in climax ("movements as light as dust... yet as determined as rivers") triggers -0.6 penalty. Synonym churn ("fractured hush deepened... air thickening") and mixed metaphors obscure causal pressure at closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    Paraphrase loops: "softly ingenious" repeated 3x without deepening. "Shared exhale" metaphor feels unearned abstraction. Final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("profound simplicity") dulls closure image. Text-artifact penalty (-0.6) for figurative muddle in peak beat disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.3)
    No closure-impairing artifacts; lyrical density serves accumulation without muddle. Minor synonym churn ("vanished paths"/"disappeared ways of being") and abstract phrasing ("vessels of possibility") create slight momentum drag, but final image ("glowing flowers") achieves crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose avoids loops and maintains propulsion, though "prick the bubble of routine" edges toward cliché in a pivotal beat. Final line’s "wilderness of carefully planned spontaneity" elegantly recharges the motif, but minor scaffold appears in dual "lightly attentive" mentions without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose shines in rhythmic control ("threads of luminous ink, weaving across her arms"), yet scaffold appears in the fledge attempt reflection ("For months... possibility itself"), diluting momentum before the moonstone discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero paraphrase loops; "noctilucent reckonings" reappears with deepened meaning without synonym churn. Sentence rhythm varies perfectly ("She would continue her craft... but with deeper intention" accelerates closure). Figurative language ("bay shimmered like scattered pearls") serves character-specific perception.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("shadows pooled between ancient pines, deepening the profound silence") drives momentum. One borderline therapy-speak phrase ("profound sorrow softened only by...") is saved by context but prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-closure abstraction ("subtle reordering of possibilities") slightly dulls propulsion. Avoids loops and scaffold, but "conceptual interference" borders academic register in high-pressure beat, costing 0.2 per Overwriting Checks.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; high density ("prism caught her movements, fracturing her image"); "spirit soared" is sole abstraction in peak beat, but final line ("vanished... until spring") recharges motifs flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor scaffold in "their approach had always been operatively gentle" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise high density ("seventeen pages of painstaking diplomacy") with zero figurative muddle in peak beats like the signature moment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in pivotal beats ("crystalline wasteland," "fractured grace"); final line’s rhythm ("listened for birdsong that would never come. And in the silence...") achieves ear-test perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.9)
    Template cadence cripples momentum: "Between sigh and smile" repeats 4x with identical function. Synonym churn ("rebellion," "defied," "bending conformity") creates conceptual redundancy without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "uncommonly serene" repeats 4x creating subtle loops; "pulsed with potential" slightly overwrites peak tension. Final line’s conceptual phrasing ("interconnectedness of all narratives") risks abstraction yet avoids muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-loop in "transiently rooted" (first 70 words) and verbatim "blushing stillness" repetition slightly dilute propulsion. Otherwise exemplary density—e.g., "knots representing generations lost" does triple duty—but artifacts prevent 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    "Snowmelt ardor" slightly overwrought in high-pressure beat; "time stretching around her like the rope" risks mixed metaphor but doesn't obscure closure. Zero loops, strong propulsion through rope work sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops in closure beat with high density ("dust motes dancing like tiny spirits" charges final image), but "what had been and what would be" repetition in mid-scene creates minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with minor redundancy: "dusky harmony" reused verbatim without deepening, and "empirically ironic" approaches synonym churn. Propulsion strong in climax ("tile lifted silently"), but scaffold weakens final paragraphs’ momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "metallic despair" and "shifting grace" avoid cliché. Final line recharges the music box motif with layered meaning. Rhythm varies purposefully ("clutching a small music box... unable to produce melodies") without muddying closure’s emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; high density ("mirror shattered like a failed constellation" compresses backstory). Final line avoids overwriting while charging closure. Minor scaffolding in "evening had begun to creep" (−0.2) but no closure artifacts; figurative language clarifies stakes throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops in closure beats with exquisite propulsion, but "feisty nature showing" scaffold and repetitive "endearingly feisty" labels trigger minor momentum drag in non-critical sections.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Paraphrase loops ("brightened disquiet" x3, "simply complicated" x2) and "somehow pulsating" weaken density; strong opening/closing lines but mid-story scaffold ("resonance field... санузл") dulls momentum without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with minimal scaffolding, though "carefully resourceful" label repetition and "mercurial library spaces" overwriting slightly dull closure propulsion. No fatal loops, but final paragraph's "forever changing and yet always waiting" risks sentimentality without concrete anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "fog pressing like curious ghosts" exemplifies textural specificity that advances atmosphere without slowing momentum, even in high-pressure memory floods.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffolding ("with her characteristically warmly methodical approach") and slight cliché ("hummed with energy"). Otherwise clean propulsion; final line’s "translating confusion into clarity" crystallizes theme without redundancy. No closure-beat artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; "gently luminous" evolves meaningfully across beats. Minor deduction for "profound quiet" bordering abstraction, but saved by concrete "sphere of stillness" imagery. Final line achieves textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "trembling hands" shows rather than tells urgency, final paragraph avoids overwriting. Minor register drift—"retrocognitively blessed" slightly jarring in otherwise character-bound diction—but no closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero scaffold or loops; every line advances texture (e.g., "crystal formations... absorbing sounds" compresses worldbuilding). Figurative language ("stormlit heavens") remains concrete and pressure-motivated, avoiding muddle even in high-stakes closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "impossible blue that illuminated his determined features" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting in "petals drinking in the spectacle" but no closure-dulling artifacts—lyricism consistently serves momentum and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "fragile ecosystem through the changes" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line ("jade cicada a silent witness") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Minor cliché ("pulsing as if alive") redeemed by later "glow" reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops with high density ("hollow quiet of the middle sky"), but "intangibly tangible" functions as mixed metaphor and "sprout new awareness" edges toward cliché in peak ascent beat.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong rhythm with purposeful fragments ("The train whistle sounded"), but paraphrase loops ("fluidly logical mind" repeated verbatim) and template cadence in "X began to Y" constructions (para 9-10) create subtle momentum drag in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold loops ("pulsed with ancient energy dormant for generations"); strong propulsion but "holographic overlay" slightly muddles physicality in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("burned bridges carefully" compresses backstory efficiently). Figurative language ("threshold shimmered like heat lightning") enhances clarity without muddling peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    Final beat "pyramid scheme survivor became guardian of a miracle" is blatant thematic echo—stock phrasing dulls closure. "Shadowseam wonder" appears twice as unearned label; artifacts in closure beat trigger -0.9 penalty, disallowing 9+ globally per Text-Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.9)
    Zero closure-touched artifacts, but "golden shadows" paraphrase loop (-0.2) and filter-verb stack ("began to muse"/"mind formed") in high-pressure beat (-0.5). Propulsion falters during reflection block.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Dust rose like tiny spirits" risks overwriting in high-pressure beat; minor scaffold in "time seemed to both stand still and rush forward" but propulsion remains strong through crystalline fruit's chime activating unsnapping.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "tactfully hopeful" verbatim repetition; "fractured journeys/fractured souls" borders thematic echo, but no closure artifacts and strong verbs ("radiating circles") sustain propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful specificity, but minor artifacts ("realized memories" typo, final paragraph's slight overwriting) prevent 9+ eligibility despite strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Paraphrase loops cripple momentum: "quietly vivid" (3x), "vested hush" (2x), and "eerie nostalgia" (2x) in critical beats. Worst offense: "whisper battling whisper through negative space" violates physical logic in the climax, dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("transformed after each hush"/"emerges transformed always") and "mossy delight" thematic echo dull closure beat; otherwise strong density, but final-third artifacts disallow 9+ per text-artifact guard.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats; "sunlight filtered through broken glass... shifting with breeze" layers atmosphere and action. Mild cliché ("shadow that followed him") and one filter-verb stack ("Elias became uncertainly certain") prevent 9.0, but propulsion remains taut through concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with concrete propulsion ("grasped the core principle of kintsugi intentions"), but paraphrase loops ("rain-washed" x4, "broken" variants) and slight overwriting in closure ("imperfect yet more beautiful for its flaws") prevent 9+; no artifacts dull closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in "crystallizing in the air like visible joy" creates metaphor muddle. Otherwise, high density with rhythmic propulsion; "dissolved into shimmering light" avoids cliché through prior motif integration. No closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in therapist reference ("his therapist had said...") summarizes without altering tactics; otherwise high density with zero loops—every phrase advances psychological state or forest mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion with zero loops, but reflection exceeds BRR limits: "For years, I studied..." compresses time without altering present tactics. Final paragraph slightly overwrought ("perfect circle of understanding"), though closure remains clear and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold in Q7: "weightless burden" repetition creates synonym churn, and the horologist backstory paragraph uses template cadence ("The ticket office had been... Local legends..."). No closure artifacts, but pre-closure loops prevent 8.8+; otherwise strong propulsion through concrete verbs like "scooped," "sputter," "cleaving."

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops but minor density issues: "dendritic frost patterns" borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats. Propulsion remains strong through concrete verbs ("vibrated," "rustling," "churning"), though "crystalline vial containing condensed light" slightly bloats closure’s lead-in.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or figurative muddle; "golden dust motes" to "chaotic, beautiful tapestry" shows high density. Minor synonym churn ("shimmering fragment glimmered"/"shimmering curtains") prevents 9.5.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "fingers danced between gears like composer's across piano keys" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Only microscopic flaw: "tinkersong wonder" slightly forced compound. Final paragraph’s cadence ("Elias smiled... guardian of light") resolves with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level propulsion excels with rhythmic variation ("surface like polished obsidian"), but "primordial darkness" and "countless generations" verge on overwriting in the lagoon climax, diluting immediacy by 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural specificity in opening, but scaffold appears in explanatory interiority ("Elena, being perpetually learning, recognized...") and synonym churn around "reimagine" weakens propulsion in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with minimal scaffolding, but "suspended stars" metaphor slightly overwrites and "dawning hush" repetition in final paragraph approaches template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Searing reverie" repetition creates subtle synonym churn; otherwise high density with propulsion—"beach debris rearranged itself into answers" crystallizes tension without muddle, though debris description edges toward scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym churn ("physical restoration alone could never truly revive... physical improvements without cultural renewal") and overwrought final line ("beacon of rebirth in a fragmented world") sap momentum. Otherwise clean propulsion with vivid specificity; no closure-dulling artifacts but reflection sections suffer template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.2)
    Paraphrase loops ("rustling... seemed louder"/"breeze rustling leaves") and "unripened fruit" repetition dull momentum; no closure artifacts but density falters in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; high density ("oak acorn cap, worn smooth by generations of handling both physical and temporal"). Final line’s "fragile and yet eternal" crystallizes theme without muddle. No figurative slack in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level propulsion excels: "rope tightened with no human hand touching it" merges action and revelation. Zero paraphrase loops; density peaks in climax ("eerie luminescence... gentle pull"). Minor lexical illusion: "credulously curious" (should be "credulously" alone) slightly disrupts POV lexicon but not closure. Final line’s "mountain itself had been trying to talk" avoids overwriting via concrete charge. No artifacts dull closure; momentum flawless despite lyrical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats; "primal elegance of existence" slightly risks purple prose but remains voice-anchored; immaculate syntactic variety propels the cosmic revelation without muddying causality.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "wax that never hardened" multiplies meaning across beats. Final line ("ghostly smiles... proper keeper") crystallizes theme without sentimentality. Minor deduction: "tangled covenant" repetition slightly dilutes density in mid-section, though never muddles closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere ("leaking moments like water through a sieve") or character; final line's triadic rhythm ("comfort, a guide, and a friend") crystallizes closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with rhythmic propulsion, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("harmonizing discord" x3) and elevated diction in "fleeting testament to the storm" dilute immediacy in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; propulsion through strategic compression ("For the first month... By the third month"). Final line recharges "six months" motif with "hands yet unborn." Hairline slip: "gently systematic" appears verbatim twice without variation, costing 0.1 despite no closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "rainwashed tower" innovates beyond cliché via "bronze quiet." "Luminous skeptic" repetition (3x) earns credit as patterned escalation deepening meaning. Final line "illuminated by chemistry" avoids figurative muddle in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion and specificity ("mourning cries of gulls"), but paraphrase loop ("he knew... he understood") and "fragile embrace" cliché. "ttk duelersi" typo in climax beat prevents 8.5+; final image avoids sentimentality with clean syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("swept dust," "hollowed the world"), but synonym loops ("wax-preserved leaf" → "waxed leaf" → "leaf") and overused "wild hush" slightly dilute momentum in mid-journey beats without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density falters in final paragraph’s near-redundancy ("still a pariah, still blessed... true north had been within her"), muddling closure’s propulsion. Otherwise, concrete verbs ("sketch," "pulse," "trembled") and varied syntax elevate the prose, though one synonym loop ("temporally stretched"/"time’s elasticity") slightly dilutes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor synonym loops ("cautious abandon... heart both racing and calm") and ornamental repetition of "sacredly playful" dull propulsion. No closure artifacts, but scaffold in reflection ("Kael had once believed...") slightly drags momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose excels in density ("steps spelling 'remember'"), but "luminous absence" repetitions risk thematic echo in high-pressure beats. No loops or cadence flaws, though abstract phrasing ("resonance of each footfall") slightly dulls closure's tactile charge despite strong final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.0)
    Filter-verb stack in high-pressure beat ("Maven noticed that the hidden thunder... was growing closer") triggers -0.5 penalty. Paraphrase loop: "crafting worlds that only existed in the space between heartbeats" redundantly echoes "substituting reality nightly." Template cadence ("Every shelf overflowed... Maven felt...") dulls immediacy in opening.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "methodical work of decoding, gently separating each thread" exemplifies high-density propulsion. No figurative muddle in peak beats—final line crystallizes theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with strategic telling, but "refracted" repeats 5x in key beats risking synonym churn. Final "permission/liberation" phrasing borders on therapy-speak, though cadence shifts during ritual hour create propulsion without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose soars with concrete specificity ("weathered fingertips that had known the burn of alchemical fire"), but "fractured tapestry of his existence" risks scaffold phrasing in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor scaffolding in reflection paragraph ("mind wandering to days long past") loses 0.2. Otherwise, zero loops with high density: "barnacles clustered around its edges" conveys decay and artistry simultaneously, propelling toward the etched message.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "potent and haunting" jasmine does triple duty (sensory, emotional, symbolic). "Screaming tenderness" recurs purposefully but risks abstraction in climax. Final line's "screaming tenderness" slightly strains register yet avoids therapy-speak through embodied context.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; "gibbous moon cast long shadows" propels scene. Minor overwriting in "raw solace came in these moments" dilutes pressure but doesn’t obscure closure’s tactile heat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but "fractured grace" repetition creates a paraphrase loop (-0.2). Opening sentence slightly over-engineered ("meticulously scanned... poised to detect"); final image propulsion flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose soars with textured economy ("silvery glow, neither day nor night, like the surface of moon-bleached bone") but stumbles in flower description: "fragile but complete, pressed flat... yet somehow still vital" suffers paraphrase-loop redundancy, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("descended," "refracted," "contemplating"). Figurative language ("phosphorescent flowers carpeted stone walls like stars") avoids muddle in peak beats, enhancing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold: "dressed in practical climbing gear beneath her cloak" redundantly follows "slipped out... in climbing gear." Final image achieves crystalline clarity with zero loops.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops with high density ("ember fragments rising like fireflies"), but "anxiety and anticipation warred" is label-only emotion; final line's conceptual precision ("weight between words") compensates for mid-scene abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line multiplies meaning ("scratches of ink... ancient and immediate"). Near-perfect propulsion: paragraph breaks mirror emotional cadence. Minor deduction for "ethereal journey" (borderline abstract) in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with phrases like "rhythmic drip of water marked time she could no longer smell" doing triple duty. Minor paraphrase loop in "hush of morning fog" repetitions (opening/closing) slightly dulls closure's momentum without obscuring causality.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but "breath held" recurs with slight variation (words 72, 128, 170), triggering paraphrase-loop penalty. High density maintained: "vapors coiling upward like miniature dragons" compresses atmosphere and tension.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "fingers merged like mist" avoids figurative muddle in peak beat. Minor deduction for "unsaid words and unshed tears" bordering cliché, but saved by contextual specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    "Wanderingly exact" appears 3x in high-pressure beats with near-synonym churn ("meander without purpose," "paradox resolved"), triggering −0.3 loop penalty. Figurative density ("universe's hiccup") remains legible but edges toward overwriting in the altar sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Eminently peculiar" becomes a repetitive label loop after first use; "razor edges" shifts from concrete to thematic without sufficient causal anchoring in the reversal sequence, muddying the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero prose artifacts; "quiet wildfire" motif maintains clarity while charging emotional density, with paragraph rhythms accelerating during laser interactions to mirror pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold in "transforming every moment into one of those lucid contradictions" slightly dulls momentum; no figurative muddle but "clover melancholy" repetition edges toward thematic loop in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "pipes snaking like metallic intestines" does triple duty (setting, metaphor, tone). Final line recharges the disc motif with precision: "Elias no longer felt haunted but harmonious" avoids muddle. Minor deduction for "melodically haunted" repetition, but pattern pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "waves of ivy" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line’s cadence ("grateful to him though they'd never know his name") recharges motif with perfect propulsion. Slight overwriting risk in rumor spread count avoided by accumulative purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "quiet blaze" motif evolves without overwriting. Final line ("quiet blaze kindled within his soul") recharges prior imagery with crystalline clarity, though "platinum compass ring, a heirloom" has minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor synonym churn ("mysterious yet intimate, terrifying yet welcoming"); otherwise clean propulsion; final line’s "cradled her in its strange comfort" achieves textural specificity without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; high density ("vintage camera, though filmless, captured emotions not images"). Deducted 0.2 for "scattered diamonds" cliché and minor figurative muddle ("invisible threads"), though payoff in final image saves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("trembling hands" repetition) and slight register drift in "volcanic tenderness" usage; high density maintained but restoration sequence has 2 redundant sensory descriptions dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid light responding to emotions" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor filter-verb use ("she knew") in low-pressure beats avoids muddying closure’s propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "geomagnetic storm intensified" rephrased identically three times in 70 words. Coin's "strange warmth" followed by "sensation that always preceded clarity" tells instead of shows. Final line lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Spiralingly calm" and "stillwater tension" loops in high-pressure beats trigger -0.4 artifact penalty; otherwise vivid propulsion. Final image’s "patterns on cobalt dock" avoids closure dulling.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in lines like "cradling a small crystal that glowed with captured starlight" which integrates character, setting, and theme. Final line recharges "forests of second thoughts" with crystalline clarity, avoiding closure artifacts. Slight overwriting in "hush where past meets prophecy"—elevated diction clashes with Arthur’s otherwise grounded voice during a pivotal grotto scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Heart a battlefield" followed by "combative tenderness" creates minor synonym loop; "salt sugar" simile is fresh but slightly jarring—no major artifacts dulling the potent closure image of dissolving scrimshaw.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("each curl of wood falling with significance" advances character and theme). Final line ("remade hush settling... like forgiveness") resolves through image, not assertion. Minor register drift in "symbol of enforced joy" slightly jars, but "sepia and dust" specificity compensates. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is lush but contains paraphrase loops: "dissolving boundaries" repeats identically across beats, and "tremor of certainty" → "steady pulse" is semantic churn. Final line ("journey that would transform...") risks overwritten abstraction, though rhythm generally propels the scene without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose avoids loops with high density ("prismatic reflections through hanging glass ornaments"), though "innocently cunning" feels like telling; the final image’s "subtle variations of gray and shadow" crystallizes tension without figurative muddle in the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density falters with paraphrase loops ("texture of connection" → "tapestry of human experience"); "powerfully gentle" label repeats without showing tradeoffs, triggering -0.5 artifact penalty that disallows 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero paraphrase loops; "folded origami figures—cranes, butterflies, flowers" demonstrates syntactic variety. Minor deduction for "genuinely artificial" (9D), a label-only trait disrupting lexicon consistency in craft description.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose achieves high density ("cryptocurrency crashes transformed his once-obscure cartomancy practice") with minimal scaffold, though "rain continued its incessant dance" slightly echoes later "rain continued to bead," creating minor rhythmic redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose flows with rhythmic control ("twilight deepened, casting long shadows"), but paraphrase loops ("steadily unpredictable" repeated without pressure) and therapy-speak ("perfect convergence of anguish and joy") trigger -0.4 penalty. Final beat’s figurative muddle obscures cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero scaffolding; high density where "petal-soft leaves" and "cool, smooth" stone advance atmosphere and character; sentence rhythms vary organically (e.g., lyrical "dissolved, not disappearing" cadence during climax) with no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    No closure artifacts, but "quietly vivid" and "fragile convictions" risk generic phrasing; minor synonym churn in "shimmering stillness" descriptions (-0.4 per text-artifact policy) caps high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "frosted hourglass began to glow" crystallizes tension without loops. Minor repetition ("closure seeker" phrasing) avoids scaffold; final image ("creator of new beginnings") recharges prior motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "spatially imaginative mind" repetition creates synonym churn, while "hushed thunder" metaphors risk muddling causality; density penalty applied but closure image ("dissolve boundaries") remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "her hands could no longer shape clay, her brush could no longer hold pigment" weakens propulsion; no closure-tainting artifacts but prevents 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "ethereal blues and purples that seemed to pulse" exemplifies textural specificity. "Soft luminescence" borders on generic but doesn't dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "gear grew warmer, its glow intensifying" avoids filter verbs. Minor thematic echo risk in "probable miracles" offset by contextual embodiment in sensory details and closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("gentle persistence"/"gentle persistence that defined them"); no figurative muddle but "patient as stone" weakens peak beat density.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "frostbitten hope" specificity avoids purple prose. Minor deduction: "seraphically mundane" slightly elevated but justified by character's artistic lens. Final line's "danced with newfound rhythm" delivers crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    No loops or scaffold; high density with "dust motes danced in increasingly erratic patterns" charging atmosphere. Minor overwriting in collapse sequence ("shelves crumbled into dust while books dissolved") slightly dulls momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero scaffold in closure beat, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("renewing vibrant colors... transformed in ways") trigger -0.2; lyrical density elevates momentum yet "periodically eternal" repetition dulls cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "spirit reached for the heavens" slightly muddles the climax; otherwise, high density shines ("brass casing warm from her grip" conveys history, tension, and intimacy in six words).

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero scaffold loops, but "implanted destiny" functions as therapy-speak label in a peak beat without embodied cost within three lines.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "methodically folding the image away" followed by "moving among the plants" creates slight momentum drag; otherwise exceptional density with concrete verbs like "graft" and "nurture" avoiding overwriting in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density ("charcoal into gray oblivion") with minimal loops, though "reality began to reassemble... reality had not been a problem" creates a paraphrase echo. No closure-dulling artifacts, but "luminescent ache" recurrence near end blocks 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong propulsion with "eclipse’s final shadow passed" accelerating the climax, though "intricate pattern" followed by "ephemeral patterns" risks synonym churn. Zero artifacts in closure beat preserves the vital fluctuations’ impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong propulsion until climax where "within the blink" paraphrase loop and stacked modifiers ("brilliantly conflicted and resolute") muddle momentum; final image’s "electricity of awakening potential" risks purple prose but salvaged by concrete "snow above" anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with concrete propulsion ("fragile stem in airship scrap fabric"), but "fragrant whispers" and "imperceptible vibrations" verge on overwriting in peak beats; no loops or scaffold, yet slight figurative muddle dulls closure’s tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops in final beat ("The echo would change him too... Years later") dull closure; template cadence in zigzag descriptions triggers -0.4 artifact penalty without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.9)
    Paraphrase loop: "devotedly observant eyes... devotedly observant mind" (adjacent sentences) triggers -0.2. Overwritten phrases ("playful solemnity," "orbits of determination") slightly blur pressure. Final image ("write the truth that would change everything") lacks specificity for 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "raking at the dissonance of old guilt that nested in his chest" dilutes momentum; otherwise crystalline prose where "insect seemed to pulse with life" avoids purple prose while advancing dual tension.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "lilac unease" risks abstraction but is redeemed by immediate sensory context; zero loops, high density, and the final line recharges the opening motif without muddling peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "shattered sky" cliché offsets "enameled blue and gold" specificity. Near-loop in "silence and ash, punctuated only by whisper of wind" costs 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor scaffold in "another echo, another memory, another possibility" dulls climax rhythm; otherwise flawless density with strategic telling compressing backstory.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.1)
    Template cadence in final paragraphs ("Maya carefully documented... Maya carefully packed") creates minor momentum drag. High density in geode descriptions compensates, but "defied conventional physics" risks figurative muddle near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=5.1)
    Template cadence ("Maya descended... Maya approached...") dulls immediacy. Overwriting in closure: "renewed purpose... constant reminder... fulfill her motivation" violates concision. Filter-verb stack ("watching... understanding... realizing") obscures cause/effect near closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor synonym loops ("quietly inspired" reprise) and abstraction ("profound connection") reduce density. No figurative muddle, but "amber warehouse" repetition lacks variation. Final line’s propulsion elevates closure despite mid-story rhythmic uniformity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Silver hush" repetition creates paraphrase loop in high-pressure beats (-0.4), but snow-code description achieves high density; "prudently daring" label weakens otherwise strong embodied prose during descent.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line propulsion flawless until "distill complexity" abstraction in climax—a single thematic phrase marring otherwise dense, loop-free prose in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("careful precision... sharp gentleness") dulls immediacy. Zero artifacts in closure beat; propulsion maintained through varied syntax ("Soon, chimney smoke... then flatten"). Figurative language serves density without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion but "wistfully pragmatic heart ache" risks label-speak; template cadence in harbor description ("water shimmered... masts swayed"). No closure artifacts, but minor loops cap high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    No loops or scaffold, but "brittle fragments... began to coalesce, no longer fragile pieces but mosaics" contains paraphrase redundancy; figurative language stays precise yet slightly overwrought in high-stakes awakening sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density falters with paraphrase loops: "after the cloud bursts" repeats four times mechanically. "Dripping from curved ceilings into the lily pond" strains physical logic, and "prismatic quiet" overuse edges toward purple prose, though final-image clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minor artifacts: "astronomical charts began to tremble" anthropomorphizes without physical cause; "cosmic significance" uses abstract nouns where sensory detail would strengthen climax.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    No loops or scaffold in closure beat; high density with "air grew thick/viscous" showing transfix, though "vibrating with energy" weakens verbs slightly in high-stakes sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong textural specificity ("gold-and-silver threading catching dim light") offsets minor scaffold in "methodical" repetitions; no closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("The panel responded with a soft chime, revealing hidden controls"). "Spongey dread" risks mixed metaphor but remains character-coherent. Final image ("copper nail still warm") charges closure with tactile specificity. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion until scaffold wrap’s "secret mapped by movements" – near-predictable phrasing dulls high-pressure beat; final third avoids fatal artifacts but "echo of luminous disbelief" borders on loop.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion until repetitive "perceptively calm" (5x) and "dusky harmony" (3x) create synonym churn in high-pressure beats. Final line’s specificity elevates closure, but filter-verb stacks ("maintained," "represented") slightly blunt momentum in reflection passages.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion until climax where clinical phrasing ("activated by the shared burden") disrupts immersion; minor synonym loops in final paragraph dull closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters in the circle sequence where near-identical stems ("The first circle... second circle...") create a template cadence run, slightly dulling immediacy in the pressure climax despite otherwise clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.9)
    Overwriting dilutes pressure: "purposefully curious" and "anxious elation" recur as abstract labels rather than embodied action. Template cadence ("As dusk deepened...") appears in high-stakes ritual beat, but no closure-dulling loops prevent 8.0+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Scaffold penalty (-0.3) for synonym loops ("life from death, death sustaining life"); otherwise strong propulsion. Filter-verbs ("she believed," "she saw") dilute immediacy but avoid closure-touched artifacts, keeping density high in pivotal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor overwriting in "hollowed out like the abandoned quarry" slightly dulls closure impact; otherwise high density and propulsion, but "echo valley longing" in dialogue borders on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Paraphrase loop in "haunted ambitions... overwhelming desire" (lines 14-15) creates scaffold; "second heartbeat" cliché dilutes seed's embodiment. Minor artifacts in first third avoid closure impact but prevent higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid story-silver" precise metaphor. Sentence variety supports pressure (long descriptive vs. short "Who emerged..." climax). Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete verbs. Minor deduction for "wintersun serenity" slight register drift in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero scaffold/loops with high density, but "heartbeat" repetition creates minor cadence echo; "latent radiance" overuse in peak beats slightly muddles figurative clarity despite strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    "Daringly methodical" label appears twice without fresh embodiment; minor scaffold in "her research suggested... her市政府 papers had mentioned" slightly dulls momentum, though final lines achieve crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "revelations in margins, mirrors, tea leaves" risks checklist rhythm but avoids synonym churn. Final line’s precision ("another unspoken truth in a world full of them") achieves high density without muddle, though "cautious exuberance" leans tell-not-show early on.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion maintained through varied sentence rhythms ("She laid down her calipers and prepared the ritual" vs lyrical descriptions); minor redundancy in "cold vacancy, a silence" costs 0.2 but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("radiant hush" x2, "threshold of stillness" x2) trigger −0.3 deduction; elevated diction ("lucidly watchful") fits POV but density borders overwriting in memory-weaving beat. Strong propulsion otherwise, though closure beat lacks 9+ zero-loop rigor.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.2)
    No fatal artifacts, yet subtle loops dilute momentum: "scallop" recurs 5× with diminishing returns, and "contentment" shifts meaning without sufficient groundwork in the final beats where cost must land.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    Paraphrase loop on "hollow mirror shard" (4 near-identical mentions) in the final third dulls closure image, capping high-band eligibility. Otherwise strong specificity ("sea glass and driftwood," "brass for truth").

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong rhythm and density, but "skin tightening" repetition creates a subtle scaffold loop. Filter verbs like "Maya reached forward, her movements precise" slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Final line ("payment for wisdom shared") risks abstraction but is anchored by Elien's physical aging.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "weathered resolve" repetition (Q4 setup/final beat) and dense figurative language in high-pressure moments slightly dull immediacy, though final image remains clear and propelled.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose maintains rhythmic control with varied syntax ("clouds beneath his feet solidified into mist"), though "accommodating impossibilities" repeats with minimal variation in adjacent beats, creating a subtle paraphrase loop that dulls momentum in the mist-walking sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; "meteor hush" and "robes woven from starlight" show textural specificity. Minor deduction for "vow of pure silver light" straining metaphor, though payoff with luminous vows justifies risk.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean grammar but scaffold evident ("Loran's quiet enthusiasm had sustained him..."); template cadence in para 4-5 ("Loran arranged... Loran began...") dulls immediacy; final "ashes" image slightly clichéd yet redeemed by closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lean prose overall, yet adjacent sentences restate light’s effect ("crystallized," "defined now") creating paraphrase loops that dilute the closure beat’s density.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "dripping rates counting down" achieves triple duty (character/plot/theme). Final line "sea had warmed beneath repaired bell" charges closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "muted shades of violet" exemplifies textural propulsion. One paraphrase loop ("receding/reservoir" in opening) and "spinning silence" repetition prevent 8.5+. Final line’s "reclaimed truth" skirts abstraction but redeemed by concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.4)
    Redundant sensory escalation ("halo around her face"/"kaleidoscopic display intensified") creates paraphrase loops; template cadence ("She carried... Before... Her motivation...") dulls momentum in high-stakes ritual beats where syntax should fracture.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose suffers from scaffold loops: "Remembering through muscle memory" appears verbatim twice within 10 lines, violating paragraph cut test. Strong verbs ("sketched," "tightened") offset generic phrases ("attentively inventive"), but synonym churn ("reconfigure," "repricing") in high-pressure beats muddles clarity near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("allowing herself to feel again, embracing the pain") dulls immediacy in climax; otherwise clean propulsion, but final line's "exponential potential" slightly overwrites conceptual closure with thematic assertion.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    No closure-dulling artifacts; prose lush but avoids overwriting traps. Minor scaffold: "Here, in this moment suspended between storm and stillness" redundantly echoes prior storm description, costing 0.2 under Text Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Synonym churn in "mournfully eager" repetitions (-0.3) and thematic echo in "tending to the unspoken" (-0.2) trigger Non-closure Accumulation Cap; no artifacts dull closure's "ghost of laughter" resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold loops; "crystalline petals shifting from pure white to indigo" shows multi-sensory specificity. "Foggy lucidity" repetition borders paraphrase but pays off in closure image. Final line's "cosmic library" avoids purple prose through concrete antecedent ("infinite library").

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves remarkable density ("frozen bloom" motif), but filter-verb stacks ("his hands weathered... his nature heightened... feeling every crack") dull immediacy in paragraph 4's critical setup.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym churn dilutes peak beats: "serenely electric" recurs identically (fragment’s "pulse," aura’s "expansion"). No closure-dulling artifacts, but stacked descriptors in high-pressure moments prevent 8.5+ propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    No fatal loops, but "interconnected patterns" repeated four times with near-identical syntax dulls propulsion; template cadence ("He picked up... He adjusted... He removed...") in climax sequence slightly impedes momentum without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with propulsion, but paraphrase loop: "memories altered" verbatim repeat in para 5/6 dulls closure beat; "realistically imaginary" recurrence lacks evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    One paraphrase loop ("Kael adjusted... watching" followed by role establishment) and forced "balancedly curious" phrasing. Otherwise clean propulsion; final line’s rhythm variation ("stars... waiting... depths") earns cadence shift without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "reeling hush" motif evolves meaningfully across beats. Information density exceptional ("pulse flickering like irregular heartbeat" conveys urgency + device state). Minor deduction for "persistently curious" label repetition in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("dormant" instruments near "asleep" console); "fibrous veins pulsing with humanity's digital lifeblood" overwrites with mixed metaphor, slightly dulling the cable motif's clarity in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold/loops; "spilled ink forms intricate webs" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Slight overwriting in "opal observatory pulses with energy under the snow globe of night" dilutes final image’s charge by 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose avoids loops but slightly overwrites with "hues of lavender and gold" and "ancient sentinels," diluting momentum. Sentences like "His skin grew wrinkled, his copper veins more prominent" achieve high density, yet "faintly with each word he spoke" contains mild scaffold. No fatal artifacts, but cadence stumbles near the climax with repetitive "he would" phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in "recognized the core concept that animated..." and two "frostbitten hope" repetitions create subtle momentum drag, but sentence propulsion and sensory specificity remain exceptionally controlled under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose flows with textural precision ("gears bloomed into intricate patterns"), but "resonantly soft" repetition (3x) creates synonym churn, and "profound release" leans toward abstraction, muddling the orchard's sigh—a critical closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "contained lightning casting shadows" shows not tells. One borderline abstraction ("sanctuary for those torn apart") lacks concrete specificity but doesn't dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion, though "misting hush" repetition in key beats crosses into scaffold territory; final dissolution image avoids Q7 artifact caps by maintaining crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-zero loops; "impossible curves defied Euclidean understanding" slightly academic for POV. "Narrative manifestations" borders jargon but doesn't dull closure's luminous simplicity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    No fatal loops but "luminous absence" appears twice in critical beats (friction -0.3). High density with strategic telling ("seven years ago"). Figurative language ("murmur secrets") serves atmosphere without muddling closure's light mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose flows with strong texture ("supernova" metaphor coherent), but scaffold weakens pivotal beats: "woman fierce in her intellect, trembling" labels instead of embodies. Final paragraph overwrites with "transformative, boundless, free," diluting the ribbon's quiet power. No fatal loops, but density falters at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.4)
    Near-flawless density: "vines that had claimed the space" shows textural specificity. One minor overwrite ("tingle of something just beyond comprehension") but final line charges closure perfectly without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels momentum (e.g., "her fingers no longer trembling" shows growth without telling). Figurative language ("hush as an empty playground swing drifts") deepens pressure without muddle, and the final line’s cadence shift—"unaware of how profoundly this forgotten library was becoming her sanctuary"—recharges the swing motif.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops with high density, but "heart beat with rhythm both ancient and new" risks therapy-speak in peak beat. Minor figurative muddle ("threads of blue-white light" emerging from fingers) slightly dulls closure's physical immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor overwriting in climax ("lucid unrest that had haunted this place transformed into something resembling peace"); strong propulsion otherwise, but "fractured rainbows" metaphor risks slight abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("marking even the slightest variations") propels momentum. Final line ("rain continued to scour the frescoes") recharges the motif without muddle. Slight register drift in "profound sense" costs 0.2 but avoids closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "water droplets rolling down its surface like tears" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final image ("plane gone entirely") crystallizes meaning without muddle, though "sophisticated melancholy" slightly overwrites.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft elevated but suffers from minor scaffolding: "time stretches like taffy" followed by "suspended moment" creates subtle synonym loop. Overwritten moments ("tinkersong wonder that echoed through digital ether") dilute momentum in low-pressure beats. Final line ("silent song continued to play") achieves crystalline propulsion without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Rich textural specificity falters with minor scaffold: "her role had never been more meaningful" tells rather than shows her shift, and repetitive "scattered light" phrasing risks overwriting in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong textural specificity but scaffold dilutes propulsion: "she believed in spooled wholeness—the idea that..." over-explains concept. "Dusty starlight" repetition feels slightly forced, though final image avoids figurative muddle with precise brass telescope sunlight.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    Impeccable line-level craft except "fractally precise mapping system"—jargon disrupts otherwise concrete lexicon during peak discovery. Single paraphrase loop ("fractally precise" x2) triggers -0.3. Near-miss for 9+ due to this register drift in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    "Stranded luminance flickered in acknowledgment" exemplifies overwriting—anthropomorphism clashes with established physical rules; minor synonym loops ("diligently curious"/"meticulously curious") sap momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Paraphrase loop ("through scraps of prophecy" verbatim repeat) and "hauntingly bright" synonym churn in final third incur -1.5 Non-closure Accumulation Cap. Otherwise strong propulsion, but artifacts disallow 9+ per rules.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.7)
    "Strangely trustworthy" functions as therapy-speak label in peak beat (-0.4); otherwise lyrical prose avoids loops, but "brambled hope" metaphor risks abstraction without sufficient concrete grounding in action.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion but "beautifully flawed" paraphrase loop (3x near climax) prevents 10.0; final line's cadence ("nested patterns... vast unknown") exemplifies strategic density.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose flows with purposeful rhythm ("twilight painted the sky"), but "graceless beauty" recurs as scaffold loop. Near-closure line "source of power that could be wielded with graceless beauty" restates prior imagery, dulling momentum by 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor scaffold in "grief had transformed" abstraction, but propulsion remains strong. River foam motif slightly over-repeated; final line ("divergent paths that could still lead home") recharges motif with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("crystalline fruits pulsed with captured narratives") propels momentum. Figurative language ("humming with forgotten promises") deepens stakes without muddle, even in peak beats like door-creation. Final "Sh" fragment is purposeful, taught by "lull" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.4)
    No closure-touching artifacts but "brittle/sturdy" motif risks overuse in high-pressure beats (e.g., "brittle nature of their emotions... brittle surfaces"). Minor density issues in pavilion descent paragraph dilute propulsion without harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops, high density ("tarnished but intact" → "sturdy and reliable"), and crystalline final line. Two slips: "empathetically decisive grace" is therapy-speak label, and para 2's "hearts empty" summary dilutes momentum. No figurative muddle in peak beats preserves near-flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero scaffold loops, but "quaking reverie" repetition creates subtle synonym churn in high-pressure beats. Figurative language remains coherent ("shadows danced with chaotically precise movements"), though "entangled memories" description risks abstraction without sufficient sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    High density with clean propulsion, but “latent blaze” appears 4x as label-only emotion (e.g., “burned within her”), and “clandestinely luminous” overuse borders on overwriting. No loops, yet figurative muddle in peak beats prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor paraphrase loop in sculpture description ("statue stood half-swallowed... roots embracing"); otherwise clean propulsion with "prisms of sound" metaphor avoiding purple prose through voice consistency.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong rhythm and specificity marred by two paraphrase loops ("thoughtfully precise" repetition) and one template cadence ("He closed... He had... He was...") dulling high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "resonant hollow where memories yet echo" exemplifies high-density prose that advances both atmosphere and character without muddling clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold loops with high information density; minor overwriting ("whispers on the wind") doesn't obscure closure. Propulsion falters only in summary beats like "Days blurred".

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong propulsion via verbs like "tear free" and "throbbed," with paragraph rhythm matching inversion’s chaos. Minor scaffold in triple "whirling silence" repetitions slightly dulls closure’s charge. No figurative muddle, but "deafening void" borders on cliché. Final line ("Verdantis would thrive") resonates cleanly. No loops or register drift in critical beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-zero loops; strong propulsion in container navigation sequences. Overwriting in "meditative rhythm" paragraph slightly dilutes pressure; "frayed but distinct" patch description edges toward generic lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose artifacts in closure: "warm blanket of serenity woven from starlight" (stock metaphor) and "proving irrefutably" (thematic tell) dull the image. Template cadence ("each note... each hue...") repeats in high-pressure beats, triggering -0.5 loop penalty in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances ritual. "Avalanchingly quiet" pays off as both setting constraint and emotional metaphor. Figurative language stays precise ("hue of the air shifted pearlescent") without muddying closure. Final line’s reprise of "canyon hush" charges the image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "topaz-laden walls shimmered with an otherworldly luminescence" edges toward purple prose. Final paragraph’s lyrical compression ("cracked open like a code") avoids overwriting, preserving propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Filter-verb stack ("recalling," "learned," "explained") dulls transfer scene momentum; "wonder blooming literally" edges toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose exhibits high information density ("quartz arbor in mist provided perfect environment") with purposeful rhythm shifts, but minor scaffold appears in repetitive "firmly grounded" labeling (paragraphs 1 and 3) and "shifted hush" echoes. No figurative muddle in peak beats, though frost pattern descriptions verge on overwriting without sufficient payoff in the prism's mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion with minimal scaffold, though "time blurred strangely" tells rather than shows temporal distortion. Final line ("weave... fabric of sound itself") charges closure without overwriting, but "hush of time's unraveling tapestry" repetition slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops ("movements imbued with purpose... hands moved with purpose") and redundant "azure defiance" repetitions dull high-pressure beats. No artifacts touch closure, but scaffold reduces density in middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor cadence loop in reality-hopping descriptions ("In alternate timelines... In other realities...") dulls momentum. Otherwise high density with clean propulsion, but final paragraph's "would-be discoveries receded" slightly overwrites the dim shard's concrete charge.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; "jade green sea glass" and "vibration despite tower's constant hum" showcase textural specificity. Final line's cadence ("lighting the way for those who followed") propels closure without overwriting—every phrase charges the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong textural specificity ("aurora energy," "luminescent properties") but "shadowed elation" loops 4x with diminishing returns; minor scaffold in reflection blocks slightly dulls closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "quietly explosive" appears verbatim in both discovery and dye effect moments. Over-explanation near closure ("people magnetize stories not through volume...") reduces density. No artifacts in peak beats, but final line's moth simile leans cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("a wave of profound understanding... washed over Samuel") propels without muddle. Final line ("humming softly... ready for the next revelation") charges closure through concrete action, avoiding abstraction. No figurative overwriting in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold loops but adjacent synonym churn ("remembered colors"/"knew daylight") triggers -0.2; exceptional density in closure ("brilliant tapestry of dawn") though "phosphorescent flora pulsing" slightly overwrites in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in opening ("Eleanor had always been...") and synonym churn ("extraordinary knowledge"/"hidden truths") dull momentum; no fatal loops, but "nested paradoxes" repetition risks thematic echo without sufficient concrete reweighting in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor synonym loops ("vanished bakery" x4) and slight over-explanation in final paragraph ("testament to how small, persistent actions...") dull momentum. No artifacts in closure beat, but "time moved differently" and "creeping normality noticer" adjacent repetition creates subtle scaffold in early pressure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold loops: "while illusions faded to memory" (para 3, 8, 13) repeats without deepening pressure. Template cadence in measurement sequences ("Elias lifted... placed... watched") dulls immediacy slightly in high-focus beats (paras 5-6).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("time slipping through fingers like damp sea air" compresses time and stakes). Final line crystallizes theme with surgical precision. One weak modifier ("strangely") negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("terrestrially cosmic energies swirled"). Minor overwriting: "futuristic nostalgia" in peak beat risks abstraction but is redeemed by "tasting time" immediacy. Final line’s "carrying futures in their cells" avoids purple prose through concrete biological metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless propulsion but minor scaffold in "Cora had always said..." slightly explains shown conflict; no figurative muddle in peak beats where "charcoal met canvas" crystallizes action with visceral clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "liquid gold that cured when truths spoken" does triple duty (character/world/theme). Final line recharges motifs with precision. No figurative muddle—sensory specificity replaces abstraction ("oilcloth and twine," "toxic sky’s uncertain light").

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose lush but "crystal clear and seemingly infinite in its overtones" followed by "unmatched precision" creates paraphrase loop. Minor register drift ("symphonies of truth" feels academic in lyrical context).

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold in "strangely organic" repetitions. "Inner static" abstraction weakens propulsion, but final image ("roots connecting to soil") achieves high density without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold ("subtle thread of curiosity") and filter verbs ("he noticed how...") dull immediacy. Strong textural specificity in "wrinkled hands trembling" but isolated. No fatal loops; final image ("sanctuary where listening healed") avoids overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose flows with rhythmic control until "as a spider spins its web" verbatim repetition and dice "mysterious familiarity" loops cause minor momentum drag in high-pressure decryption sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops; "swirling three times counterclockwise" shows obsession efficiently; final line "bridging worlds with each light she touched" recharges lantern motif with crystalline precision.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.7)
    Heavy figurative muddle ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially balanced energies") in high-pressure beats; template cadence ("As he..., the...") and paraphrase loops in the ritual sequence. Final-third artifacts (e.g., "serene and powerful—the perfect balance") disallow 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor synonym churn ("charmed skepticism"/"charmed skeptic," "ghostly resolve" repetition) and elevated diction ("tragically radiant") in peak beats trigger -0.3 penalty; no closure-dulling artifacts but density falters during reflection blocks.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with zero figurative muddle, though "pearl twilight" repetition creates minor scaffold loop. Closure image ("stepped outside for first time") resolves with textural precision.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.5)
    Template cadence in "She was richly perceptive..." paragraphs; "whispering seashell half" repeats without evolution. Filter-verb stacks ("noticing how", "sensed") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal loops; "windows of connection" repetition reweights meaningfully, though "weave truth carefully" tells where showing would strengthen momentum in dream-analysis beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    No closure artifacts, but "scintillatingly somber" and "demure audacity" register as label-heavy in peak beats; otherwise vivid propulsion through sensory compression ("frothing water into sea of ephemeral foam").

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("truth had become rarest commodity" → later "salvation or destruction"); figurative language serves causality without muddle; final line’s "ashes of deception" avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence in adjacent "Elias spent... Elias traced..." sentences creates minor scaffold loop; overwrought metaphors ("ancient shadows he harnessed") occasionally blur immediacy despite otherwise vivid propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with purposeful rhythm ("sunlight filtered through cracks... illuminating dust motes dancing"), but "theater of his solitary existence" risks overwriting in high-pressure discovery beat, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "crunch of frozen seaweed" and "cracked like distant bones" exemplify high-density propulsion. Slight overwriting risk in "numinous" offset by earned specificity in tuning fork mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose flows with purposeful variation until "restrained wildness" repetition in final paragraph creates thematic echo scaffold. "Satisfaction" weakens closure's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong sensory specificity ("greenish patina," "damp earth") but paraphrase loops ("watchfully calm exterior/belied turmoil") and "reverberate" repetition dull peak-beat propulsion; final image remains clear despite minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion in climax ("manipulator brought against the bell"), but scaffold appears in redundant phrasing: "curiosity piqued by the object's presence" followed by "symbols that piqued curiosity." Final beat avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.7)
    Loops weaken momentum: "digital ghosts... lingered in coded silence" then "digital static like ghosts." Purple prose ("constellations in a dark sky") muddles high-pressure beats. Final third artifacts block 9+ despite strong opening cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with minimal scaffold, but adjacent lines ("fingers tracing patterns... most could not see" / "ice floes below groaned") create a paraphrase loop that dulls momentum in a pivotal beat; otherwise, propulsion and specificity excel.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor synonym loops ("solace" x4, "trawl" x3) prevent 9+; "windborne solace" repetition borders on overwriting but avoids muddle as pattern is taught early and pays off in final image.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rich imagery marred by repetitive phrasing ("drawing parallels" x3, "gentle persuasion" x2) and near-synonym churn ("painful reminder"/"symbol of how even incomplete things"), slightly dulling closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high density where "conjured clearings they could manifest between realities" does triple duty as setting/concept/stakes; no figurative muddle even in peak ritual beats like "echo of wisdom flowing through them."

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "sweet fragrance... cleanse the very air" shows textural specificity. "Perceptively calm" slightly drifts into label-speak but avoids therapy clichés in peak beats, meeting high-band line craft thresholds.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in repetitive "fractured sequences" phrasing slightly dulls momentum, but zero figurative muddle in peak beats. Opening and closing lines achieve high density: "dust motes dancing in slanted light" to crystal catching "full light of dawn" with resonant closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "condensation" on the arch enables chalk adhesion, demonstrating textural specificity, though "tidal longing" slightly risks abstract phrasing before earning concreteness through action.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    High density falters in closure beat: "luminous ache" synonym loops ("breathtaking pattern... seemed to ache") and physics error (sound in vacuum) create figurative muddle that dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "blood work came back yesterday" compresses backstory efficiently, though "scent of hope" slightly strains abstraction in high-pressure beat; zero loops, but final paragraph's lyrical density risks overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose flows with strong verbs ("light erupted," "shadows stretched"), yet the final paragraph's "hints of dawn approached... would need to relearn" exhibits redundant phrasing, slightly muddying the closure image's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor abstraction in "renewal through mystery" slightly dulls closure impact; otherwise clean propulsion with zero loops—final constellation image achieves high density through concrete action ("hands joined," "boundary softened").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor overwriting in "zephyr bloom of inspiration" disrupts momentum; "pearl of stillness" slightly strains metaphor coherence. Otherwise strong propulsion through concrete actions ("worn smooth by ocean's patient hands"), but two lyrical phrases in final third cap high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops; every sentence multi-tasks ("vines wove through circuit boards... reverent" establishes setting/theme/perception). Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete emerald moss imagery. Only microscopic flaw: "reverent" borders anthropomorphism but fits voice.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=5.1)
    Severe loop penalty (-0.9): "lucidly watchful" (3x), "ephemeral cameo appearances" (3x), and "swirling hush" (3x) create template cadence. Filter-verb stacks ("he had come to understand," "he had struggled") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Final image obscured by figurative muddle ("entire universes of meaning").

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "pieced together the forgotten songs" dulls momentum; otherwise strong rhythm and specificity, but "strange pull" abstraction slightly muddles causal clarity in inciting incident.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero paraphrase loops; "frost-encased berries" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor artifact: "trembling not with fear but with reverence" risks therapy-speak but saved by contextual "power," preventing 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("settled in her mind like dust on ancient cavern floor"). Final line’s elevated diction ("wonder stored where reason could keep it safe") clashes with POV lexicon, causing register drift in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops in peak beats; "crystallization" metaphor sustains physical logic throughout. Minor cadence dip in self-burden sequence ("fractal within fractal") slightly dulls immediacy, but "kerosene lamp burner flickered" maintains propulsion. Final image’s "collected light" avoids abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "fractured light across the floor, each droplet a tiny prism" achieves high density without muddle, though "through crystallized time" slightly overwrites before being anchored by concrete examples; final line’s "captured eternity" risks cliché but earns resonance via the kettle’s temporal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("fractured stillness" repeated near climax) and dense metaphors ("silt at the bottom of this very lagoon") slightly dull momentum, but no artifacts touch the luminous closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("maze of intentions" x3 without evolution) and label repetition ("functionally creative") create subtle scaffold. Otherwise clean propulsion with concrete verbs, but nominalizations like "resurrection" slightly soften peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters with template cadences ("as the sky began to glow," "as the hidden sunrise crested") and borderline therapy-speak ("petrichor nostalgia"); final paragraph avoids these, preserving closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose avoids major loops, but "serene upheaval" and "thoughtfully clear precision" suffer abstract telling. Strategic telling compresses backstory, though "hindsight clarity had finally arrived" weakens momentum in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong rhythm and specificity ("fulgurite glass," "driftwood-rough voice") elevate prose, but filter verbs ("he noticed," "he felt") cluster in the decoding sequence, dulling immediacy during pivotal tension. Final line's "illuminated path" avoids overwriting through earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose largely propulsive with purposeful fragments ("After the last ship had sailed..."). One paraphrase loop in "explaining of absences—the parts of people..." slightly dulls momentum. No closure-impacting artifacts; vivid textural specificity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops and high density until the climax, where "light spilled... flowing" uses sequential participle phrasing implying simultaneity for non-simultaneous actions, slightly dulling propulsion in the closure beat's critical transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "gracefully alert" repetition (3x) and "migration of clouds" phrasing verge on synonym loops. Final lagoon image avoids cliché with "silver-black" specificity, though "tapped against her chest" lacks fresh embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor figurative muddle in "hair catching dim light like a luminous skeptic" dilutes immediacy; filter-verb stacking ("she felt the weight") appears in high-pressure beats, but strong propulsion through concrete verbs ("bubbled, then flow, then sing") rescues momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.6)
    Paraphrase loops ("across the quiet sigh of falling petals" x4 verbatim) and template cadence ("The... began to...") dull propulsion; "approximating infinity" becomes stock abstraction without concrete payoff in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels story. "Amber wings catching last light" does triple duty (sensory, symbolic, temporal). Closure beat pristine—no figurative muddle, just "fragile yet endless journey" charging prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "pendulum bob glinted... incremental absolution wove" demonstrates triple-duty density. "Searing reverie" slightly purple but justified by context; final reflection image perfectly recharges the opening ridge.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "velveteen gloom" exemplifies textural specificity, and the final line's "piece by piece, thread by thread" delivers crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Groundedly imaginative" appears twice as label-only trait, creating synonym churn. Otherwise strong propulsion—ink flowing parallels transformative information—but redundant phrasing ("sustaining transformation") dulls closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion with concrete verbs ("transcribed," "swirled," "danced"), but "secretly luminous beacon" edges toward overwriting. No paraphrase loops; final line avoids sentimentality through "dust particles that seemed to dance." Minor register drift in "reawakening the imagination" slightly dilutes closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "Through incomplete information..." passages dulls momentum; "crystallized fleeting emotions" borders on therapy-speak but avoids full penalty via concrete powdering action anchoring the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "patina of time" shows textural specificity. Minor deduction for "rationally rebellious" as near-label in high-pressure beat, but cadence remains clean through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density ("traveled stillness" compresses history/emotion). "Expectantly resigned" repetition risks swappability but gains specificity through context. Final beat avoids figurative muddle with concrete rosette transfer.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; "dust motes dancing" and "scents of jasmine and rust" achieve high density. Minor flaw: "synaptic plasticity" explanation slightly tells in one beat, but closure propulsion remains sharp. Final line’s cadence ("ready to return to the city that didn’t yet know...") recharges "ruins" motif with perfect resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    No fatal loops, yet "heart sank" cliché and slight overwriting in "intricate patterns catching golden light" blunt peak-beat urgency; rhythm varies purposefully but final image lacks the textural precision demanded for 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Hushed blaze" and "inadvertently profound" verge on thematic echo in peak beats; minor density issues in climax ("vibration of something profound being revealed") slightly obscure causal immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm purposefully ("Tiny fish darted... creating patterns"). Figurative language stays concrete and pressure-driven, though "incisively kind" slightly elevates diction beyond diver's plausible lexicon in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in climax ("sound like shattering glass... reality tore"). Final line’s reprise ("echoing like footsteps... finally conquered") charges closure without figurative muddle. Opening/closing symmetry flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    "Languages don’t just disappear... They sleep" is thematic echo in final paragraph (-0.6). "Saffron quiet" repetition creates synonym churn; otherwise vivid prose with strong rhythm. Artifacts in closure beat cap high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "cracking echoed—not stone, but ice" exemplifies multi-jobbing syntax. Minor register drift: "profound, historically oriented ache" slightly over-articulates interiority, but "sweet and cloying as rotting rosewater" rescues density without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops with high density, but "bleak exhilaration surged through her veins" strains in high-pressure beat. Final line ("world would never run...") achieves perfect propulsion; minor figurative muddle prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "luminance coalesced into final paradox" does triple duty. Final line's "repulsive allure" recharges opening phrase flawlessly, avoiding all figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    High propulsion with varied syntax, but "sketched resonance" looped 3x in 5 lines creates synonym churn. Final paragraph scaffold ("The ocean currents might shift... but resonance would persist") dulls closure image. No figurative muddle, but density issues prevent 9.0+ per quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    No loops or scaffold; high density ("crack appeared... spiderwebbing outward"); "sunwashed dread" avoids cliché through recurrence with evolving weight; minor overwriting risk in "whispered to him day and night" offsets by payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean propulsion with minor overwriting ("ivy that clawed... perfect metaphor"). "Final petal drops" timing feels forced, and "pit of lies" repetition in closing lines dulls closure image slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("resisted the water's pull"/"nature's grip tightened") and filter-verb adjacency ("practiced movements betraying years"). Propulsion strong but density falters in reflective moments; no closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops—every line advances story with purposeful density ("phoenix rising from waves—a fitting symbol" compresses heritage/theme); final image "new illumination had begun" charges closure without figurative muddle, achieving propulsion through varied syntax and tactile specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion with vivid specificity ("amber and gold" light), but paraphrase loop in "grief was still raw, still luminous in torment" slightly dulls momentum. No closure artifacts; final line's "surrounded by gems yet to be polished" exemplifies charged concision.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with "bleak exhilaration" doing triple duty, but "intangibly tangible" label repeats three times with diminishing impact. Minor paraphrase loop in observatory description ("sanctuary and prison... orbiting wasteland") costs 0.3 without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal scaffold—e.g., "brilliant dimness" motif taught early and paid off—but "pure recognition, a sensation that filled Maya" edges toward abstract labeling in peak beat, slightly dulling closure’s physical immediacy despite otherwise clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops in closure beat but adjacent synonym churn: "weight of unspoken words pressed" then "weight of withheld truth tormented." Final image ("lightness within tempered regret could not diminish") achieves high density without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor scaffold ("Lyra was known as uncommonly thoughtful") and near-duplicate "storm-worn" usage prevent 9.0. Otherwise, high-density prose with strong verbs ("clutched," "pierced," "untether") and no figurative muddle in peak beats; rhythm accelerates during the apology/forgiveness exchange.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold with high information density; "diminished echo of the world where she once soared" exemplifies precise textural specificity. No figurative muddle in peak beats, though "merrily melancholic state" borders on overwritten abstraction without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Delicately robust" and "jaded wonder" repeat as near-synonyms across adjacent beats, triggering paraphrase-loop penalty. High density otherwise, but figurative language in high-pressure beats slightly muddles immediacy (e.g., "water in my chest").

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "becoming less human meant losing... Yet after phoenix rose, possibilities unfurled" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise, "translucent hands reaching toward hers, not quite touching" exemplifies high-density propulsion without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Choking beauty" paraphrase loop across three high-pressure beats (throat constriction, carrying beauty, final passage) creates scaffold clutter; otherwise precise imagery and propulsion, but the loop prevents higher-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Paraphrase loop: "gravitationally lighter when happy" stated twice within three lines. Final line ("recycled vessel delivering love") achieves crystalline propulsion. No closure artifacts, but scaffold slightly dulls mid-beat immediacy during stitching sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=3.8)
    Closure-beat artifacts: "vibrant hush" repeats 5x with synonym churn ("whispering hush"), violating Q7 rules. Final paragraph features paraphrase loop ("a space between worlds where prophecies fulfilled themselves... cosmic alignment of purpose"). Template cadence in cosmic descriptions dulls immediacy; −1.7 artifact penalty applied.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with clean propulsion, though "cradle of sparks needed only the right whisper" exhibits slight overwriting. Zero loops or scaffold; final line's "potent vessel of transformation" achieves crystalline closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; high density ("collapsed star dust, its dark matter swirling"). Final line’s "peace in a world without friction" risks sentimentality but saved by concrete "gathering painted stones" action. Slight register drift in "cosmic seams" (overly abstract for her POV).

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong propulsion but scaffold appears: "years of practice keeping revolutionary thoughts hidden" tells rather than shows. "Claws of something fighting to be born" risks cliché in closure beat, slightly dulling the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    No figurative muddle in closure, but "perfect comprehension" flattens emotional cost; minor paraphrase loop in "dignified chaos" repetitions near midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with lyrical propulsion, but "luminous fracture" repetition creates paraphrase loops; "cerebral cathedral" metaphor clashes with concrete botanical imagery in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops; "flickering compasses" recurrence serves pressure not scaffold. Final paragraph's cadence shift ("disappeared—not into... but through") achieves propulsion without muddle. Minor register drift in "strategically creative".

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor scaffolding ("clutched... its surface warm") and generic descriptors ("vibrant colors"); no fatal loops but "intoxicating scents" feels stock; final line's thematic phrasing risks overwriting in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("prismatic colors shifted and danced") advances atmosphere and closure; figurative language consistently serves purpose without muddle in peak beats.
