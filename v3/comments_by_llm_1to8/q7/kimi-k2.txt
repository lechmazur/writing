  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "monarch wings once flashed like stained glass." Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("profound changes," "accumulated dust patterns"). The truncated ending and occasional filter constructions ("She believed," "She realized") dull momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Moonlight glazed the canyon walls, turning them into dark mirrors that reflected her silhouette—fragile, bright, unfinished." Some repetition of "drifting resonance" and occasional abstract phrasing ("purpose hides in the pauses between heartbeats") creates minor drag. The abrupt truncation damages momentum at the crucial final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good momentum. However, several instances of elevated diction create register drift ("glazed with silent frost," "fossilized mid-gesture"). Some metaphor density in peak beats without full payoff ("sheet music visible only at the edge of breath"). Template phrase "Rowan realized" appears twice, creating minor repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some paraphrase loops appear ("Their stories had been erased...but here...they waited" restates the absence concept). Template cadence emerges in "He had come to...He began to...He wrote until..." sequence. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well, and syntactic variety mostly supports rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from POV register ("terra-cotta arbor," "amplified quiet"). The unfinished final sentence, while potentially intentional, creates structural uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has moments of beauty but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Some paraphrase loops ("unused love" concept restated multiple times). Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions. The mystical register occasionally obscures clarity ("liquid light pooling in the cracked bowl of her chest").

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs—"water climbing hyperbolic steps whose angles hurt to follow" combines setting, impossibility, and discomfort. Some elevated diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "mnemonic sieve") fits the conceptual nature but occasionally slows momentum. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Minor overwriting in phrases like "latent electricity" and "jagged beams" that edge toward purple. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The "staggering grace" of the collapsing carnival creates effective closure imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dense, purposeful prose with lines doing multiple jobs—"cells divided in pips caught between salt and soil." Some metaphoric density in middle sections ("collecting absences the way a shell gathers absence of sea") occasionally slows momentum. Strong control of rhythm and imagery throughout with clean grammar.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments like "the jar pulsed, heavy with stolen radiance" show good compression. However, several abstract phrases dilute momentum: "reinterpret memory itself," "luminous disbelief" appears three times. The "quietly savvy" repetition and some elevated register ("architecture of timetables and farewells") create mild density issues without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "each drip from the ceiling a small bell" demonstrate precise imagery. Information density generally serves the story well. However, several passages suffer from overwriting: "weighty lightness," "pressure of unshed tears turning to steam," and extended metaphorical runs that occasionally muddle rather than clarify. The abrupt ending mid-sentence disrupts momentum significantly.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose suffers from occasional overwriting ("molten silver," "trembling certainty rose in me like tide") and filter verb clusters ("I noticed," "I felt," "I understood"). Some metaphors strain ("heart hammering against ribs that had cushioned every staged crash"). However, sentence variety and momentum generally serve the story, with strong opening and closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Wind clawed the parapet, yet an ambered hush clung"), though some metaphor density in early passages ("like resin around a fossilized bee") slightly slows momentum. The final incomplete sentence "folding itself into" works as purposeful truncation but risks feeling unfinished rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("The procedure," "The violin"). Information density high in most passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("dying stars" metaphor) and slight template cadence in the loop descriptions ("In the first loop...In the second...Now, in the third").

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("her pocket holds a single lens from an old 35-millimeter projector") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She pockets," "She lifts," "She folds") and overuse of "ambiguously clear." The phrase "already spoken" in line 30 contradicts the story's emphasis on gestural communication. Some sentences strain for effect over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "marbles...each sphere a memory of a vine she had once coaxed back from blight." Some minor repetition around "marble" and "polished" in middle sections. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful fragments enhance the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "mechanically warm air that smelled faintly of ozone and thawed frost." Some repetitive phrasing around "wings at rest" and "subdued awakening" creates intentional pattern but borders on excessive. The escape sequence maintains propulsion, though "She stood alone, breathing mechanically warm air" near the end feels like unnecessary scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of exceptional clarity ("She tilted the clarinet; a single note of water spilled out") but occasionally overreaches with density ("antique opera program she had salvaged from the flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns" needs parsing). Information density is high, supporting the accumulative pattern. Some figurative language clusters heavily in descriptive passages without always advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs (the gentian as memory/confession/transformation tool). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("cups catching the first lavender light of dawn that never quite decided whether to mourn or begin again") and "auroral sorrow" repeats. Template cadence appears in dialogue tags ("She said," "He said," "She whispered"), and abstract phrasing like "swallowed truth" and "ghosted with frost" dulls immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Legend claimed the alcove once housed a valve station for a textile mill that ran phantom looms after hours, producing nothing but the smell of wet cotton and regret." Some filter-verb clustering ("Mara felt," "she understood") in high-pressure moments reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Swan met lantern, origami angles flared"). Strong rhythm variation and syntactic variety. However, some figurative density in the vision sequence ("cities bloom and wither inside dewdrops caught on fern fronds that were also his own eyelashes") borders on overwriting without clear pattern-teaching. Minor scaffold in "The ink dried; the vines did not read" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally flows with musical rhythm appropriate to the subject, though some overwrought phrases ("hush of dreaming roots," "softly adaptive") and the incomplete final sentence detract. Information density is high with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong image density. Some repetitive phrasing around "bronze quiet" (5 instances) and "sensitively perceptive" creates mild template cadence. Filter verb clusters in discovery moments ("She understood then," "She felt," "She realized") reduce immediacy. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum through discovery and confrontation beats. Information density high in revelation sequences. Deductions for the truncated ending, occasional abstract phrasing ("familiar enigma"), and some template structures in the broadcast effects paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong verb choices, but overwriting appears in metaphor density ("frost on a window," "soft as snowfall," "fiber optics" in quick succession). Some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("the stillness between heartbeats was still negotiable"), and the unfinished final sentence reads as error rather than effect.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has moments of genuine beauty but occasional overwriting—"the upturned hush of sound turning itself inside out" strains clarity. Some template repetition in memory-mapping sequence (at X whorls, she placed Y). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The closing image effectively synthesizes all elements though some middle passages feel dense without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful fragments ("Behind her, the labyrinth dissolved"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for abstract phrases like "labyrinth of self" and "negative space of her regrets" that lean conceptual rather than concrete, plus minor repetitive stems in the middle third ("She had," "She kept").

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong sensory density and varied rhythm, particularly in ritual sequences. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("filament of hush," "mirrored hush") and some elevated diction that borders on overwriting in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong moments like "tasting iron silence" and "graphite sweet, leaf-flat, wrong" demonstrate precise sensory work. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, some phrases edge toward overwriting ("wine-dark archway," "ouroboros tongues"), and abstract constructions like "credibly curious" and "layered tranquility" appear multiple times without earning their repetition through pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, figurative language density in peak beats ("fragrance burst outward like a silent bell") and some template phrasing ("Years later, travelers speak") create mild overwriting. The incomplete final sentence is a technical error.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments of compression ("rope in lap, staring at the same stars") balance against occasional overwriting. Some figurative density strains in places ("shuttle that carried the pattern forward") but the prose achieves genuine beauty in lines like "the texture of time shift beneath his palms, soft as breath, sharp as regret." Minor template cadence appears in the "He thought of" sequence but serves accumulative purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("ribs of ancient galleons, their masts tangled in passionfruit vines"), but some paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "She would return each evening...not to fill the silence but to listen" closely echoes the prior realization. Filter constructions like "she realized" and "she understood" accumulate in the final third, dulling immediacy when the piece needs maximum precision.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("dusk's last light dripped like honey"), but several instances of abstract emotional labeling and mild redundancy ("felt her own counterfeit skins begin to slough" follows similar phrasing). The recurring "professionally thorough" creates intentional pattern but borders on mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language ("tide pulling her toward someone else's story," "stars and routes braided together"). Mixed metaphors appear ("telescope installed...so loaders could watch stars that guided their ships"). The incomplete final sentence is a critical flaw that undermines closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline specificity ("frost caught mid-breath," "translucent heart beating with refracted light"). Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scaffold phrases ("She understood then," "Years later") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("canal forked ahead, splitting into two glass troughs") and varied sentence structures. However, some figurative density in peak beats ("spiral staircase of liquid light," "glass bird with a throat full of unresolved questions") and occasional abstract phrasing around the time-sculpting mechanics create minor opacity. The paraphrase of stealing time appears twice in adjacent sections.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "lantern trembling like a guilty thought" and "memories surfaced," though some passages edge toward density ("The patterns on the stone resembled wings, or perhaps parentheses enclosing an unsolved sum"). Minor template cadence appears in "She whispered...She had refused...She traced" sequence but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong sensory prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("joists she had memorized like braille" establishes both familiarity and touch-based navigation). Some figurative density in places ("sapphire hush" appears 3 times) but serves pattern. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" openings across 3-4 lines.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation, but contains template patterns ("She had always believed," "She would not") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density. The "syllable by syllable, drop by drop" construction and some filter-verb clusters ("she realized," "she understood") create minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagistic density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("the quiet awful certainty that now and then had just folded into one another like crumpled paper"). Some metaphor density in early beats without full payoff, and "dusted stars" feels forced, but momentum generally sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm, but several issues: repetitive "overlapping shadows" appears three times; abstract phrasing around "unseen forces inhabit" lacks concrete embodiment; some simultaneity confusion in the transformation sequences. The ending maintains momentum but the final line cuts off mid-sentence, suggesting incompleteness.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "exile's term finally served" establishing both timeframe and motivation. Sentence variety and rhythm support the accumulative structure. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("compiling fragments into meaning") and some elevated register that borders on overwriting in places like "fanfares" and "conspirators."

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. Some overwriting appears ("meticulous route mapper...stood beneath the starlit vault in mist") and occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("fortress of unspoken truths"). The incomplete final sentence works as intentional truncation. Information density remains high despite metaphorical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagery ("whales traced silver scars across the moonlit water") with good rhythm variation. Information density high in key passages. However, abstract constructions appear ("sharp enough to cut through fear," "space for reflection") and some paraphrase loops around memory descriptions reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and effective rhythm shifts during the manipulation sequence. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("drum inside a drum," "iron filings to a lodestone") without becoming opaque. Some elevated diction ("escondite," "continuum") serves worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity, but figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("liquefies rigid thinking," "moral ledger scribbled crookedly"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("one death equals one life" restated as "fair trade"), and filter verbs accumulate in reflection passages.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting appears ("gilded-leaf stationer" feels precious). Rhythm varies naturally between long accumulative sentences and shorter declaratives. Some figurative density in places ("refracted the sound through the prism of his own longing") but generally serves the textural mode.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, with lines like "I pocket these rumors like smooth stones, feeling their weight change" doing multiple jobs. Some abstract moments ("discovering the texture of memories") could be more concrete, but overall prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("maple ribs gleaming like wet bone"). Minor template repetition with "She [verb]" constructions in middle section. The closing image successfully recharges earlier motifs without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information-dense prose achieves strong momentum—"spray-painted mermaid whose scales spelled out meeting times in hexadecimal" does triple duty. Some metaphoric density in early paragraphs ("wary grace of a culture shock absorber") could be streamlined, but the language serves the accumulative mode well with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The crater was young, only sixty years old" establishes timeline, scale, and emotional resonance. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm, from short declarations ("Twenty minutes remained") to complex observations. Minor repetition of "ghost" (ghostly, ghost-white) and some filter constructions ("She thought of," "She remembered") prevent higher scoring but don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The mist-coated rail depot hummed with the low magnetic calm" establishes setting, atmosphere, and anticipation simultaneously. Some mild repetition of "magnetic calm" and occasional filter constructions ("she knew," "she could hear") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The phrasebook in her pocket grew heavier, as if the ink were liquefying into actual water" advances plot while deepening metaphor. Zero loops or scaffolding, with propulsive syntax that accelerates through the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong syntactic variety and information density—most sentences advance both atmosphere and plot. Rhythm accelerates from measured opening to fuller "layered with heartbeats and pawbeats" at climax. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("memory of feet," "breath exhaled after a long illness") that, while evocative, slightly reduces immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "floated inside the cracked observatory dome, her exosuit's lamp painting ghosts across algae-filmed constellations" establishes location, equipment, atmosphere simultaneously. Minor repetition of "gathered hush" and "lonesome splendor" reads as purposeful pattern, not loop. Some elevated diction ("colonnades," "nave") fits underwater temple context.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("threading them together until the mirrors cracked along their seams") and some repetitive constructions in the mirror sequence. The "copperlight repose" repetition works as purposeful pattern. Information density is high but occasionally sacrifices clarity for lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with lines like "fruit that glowed like captive stars." Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. Minor issues include repetitive "had + past participle" constructions in backstory sections and occasional overwriting ("lovingly venomous" works thematically but strains as description). The final image of the warm bead "humming with resonant awakenings" lands with appropriate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the moonlight struck the illustration so that the painted child's eyes opened, reflecting the canyon's red glow"), though some phrases edge toward purple prose ("bruised velvet," "orchid solace"). The story maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful repetition of weaving imagery, with minor template cadence in the middle sections ("She began," "She placed," "She lifted").

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "she traced them with the same reverence she once gave Roman inscriptions, feeling history breathe." However, some figurative density in peak moments ("portable orchard of reconciled histories," "pocket-sized dawn") and occasional abstract phrasing ("faith was not a monument but a process") create minor opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("memory of tomorrow," "childhood scraped across time") though density occasionally tips high. Information density excellent—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Some template cadence in middle section ("She [verb]" patterns) and minor paraphrase loops around the margin concept. Prose rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("tongue of fire that never shortened, never smoked, only whispered"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Template cadence appears in "She heard" repetition near the end, and some elevated diction ("resonant reconfiguration") doesn't match Mira's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density rewards close reading: "fierce tenderness" recurs meaningfully, sentences vary from compressed ("She walked deeper") to expansive ritual descriptions. Minor repetition in "spoke/speak" variants across paragraphs, but information density remains high with each line advancing emotional or ritual progression.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"monitors beeped like distant buoys" simultaneously establishes setting, mood, and water motif. Some minor repetition in the coral handling descriptions. The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and rhythmic control, particularly in the shorter, breathing sentences near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the fragment both glimmers and projects light for painting). Some register drift into elevated diction ("fold around her like warm cloth," "halftones") and minor template cadence in the ending sequence ("Liora would be gone...And so the cycle would continue") reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the nickel is object, tool, and portal). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths. Vivid specificity ("heat above summer asphalt," "bindle slung"). Deduction for occasional abstraction ("methodically playful" repeated without variation) and the incomplete final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("rows of orchid mantis nymphs practiced their prayers"). However, several overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("digestive acids smelled faintly of redacted footnotes," "faulty syntax" for city lights). The abrupt truncation mid-sentence is a significant technical flaw. Some figurative density in peak beats borders on excess.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    Information density is high—most sentences carry multiple functions, as in "tears that tasted of magnesium and regret" (sensory + emotional + elemental). Some figurative density in early sections ("moons," "cathedrals," "galaxies") risks overwhelming, but the language clarifies as the poet moves toward resolution. The progression from complex imagery to the simple final incompleteness ("He") creates effective momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"She wore gloves of spider silk so thin the orchids seemed to breathe against her palms" establishes both delicacy and animacy. Some figurative density in early passages ("moth with singed wings") but serves the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory work. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("cautious exuberance made visible") and some figurative density that approaches overwriting without quite crossing into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong sensory integration ("each tarnished brass link clinking like a muted bell") but suffers from repetitive emotional labeling ("trembled" appears twice, "slyly heartfelt" feels forced) and occasional overwriting in figurative language. The paraphrase loop between lines 11-12 about the letter's warning creates redundancy that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("trust was a cracked thing," "spines cracked like old bells") and occasional abstraction. Strong moments like "dust motes could swirl like notes above the rafters" balance weaker passages. Minor template cadence in middle sections but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery and varied sentence structure. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("distances inside her chest aligning with the distances outside") and repetitive phrasing around "sacred thresholds" and "necessary distances." The "shattered butterflies" image effectively ties to the butterfly effect concept.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and emotional state), though occasional elevated diction borders on overwriting ("softly ingenious mind"). Sentence variety creates natural breathing rhythm, and the opening/closing images create effective bookends without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"cheerful gloom" appears 6 times, "before memory fades" 5 times, "crater glass" 8 times. While these create rhythmic pattern, they edge toward mechanical repetition. Some sentences strain with compound metaphors that blur rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "wore a coat stitched from theater curtains" establishing character, economy, and theatrical metaphor simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("cardinal's cape," "equilateral triangle") occasionally strains but serves the mathematical precision of Finch's worldview. The final truncated "metron" creates purposeful incompletion without harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "black marble benches gleamed like wet wings" simultaneously describes, atmospheres, and suggests transformation. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm without template patterns. Minor density issues in places like "moonstone cabochon dust speck" but overall propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("dawn bleed pale gold," "crystal ribs glimmered like frost") but occasionally overwrites ("quiet anthem to overlooked beauty"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence appears in tide pool sequences ("She found...She felt...She fitted") reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language occasionally tips toward overwriting ("colors into the air...rose like auroras, soft ribbons against the hard black sky"). Some abstraction in the pain-translation mechanism and mild template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions, but momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied syntax. However, several instances of abstract/elevated diction ("transmuted," "propagate," "recursive") and some repetitive phrasing around "equations for hope" and "patterns with decorations." The prose occasionally prioritizes concept over momentum, particularly in explanatory passages.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("mortar pulse like a slow heartbeat") but suffers from repetitive constructions. "Half-burned diaries found in the fireplace" appears verbatim four times, creating template cadence. Some overwriting in figurative density ("walls remembering nights when telescopes drank photons"). Information density is high but momentum occasionally stalls in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density varies—strong passages like "she knelt, perceptively calm, and pressed the locket to the wet stone" do multiple jobs, while others merely elaborate. Template cadence appears in "She had come to... She knelt... She understood then..." creating predictable rhythm. The phrase "dusky harmony" repeats without evolution, and some abstract constructions ("treaty between what is and what could be") slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the river carried rumors north") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without always serving pressure. Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("treaties with the velocity of bullets," "background radiation"). Information density is high but sometimes sacrifices momentum for poetic effect.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose shows high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The drought that starved the lowlands was her own design"). Some mild repetition appears ("fractured" used multiple times) but doesn't obscure closure. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "each one catching the starlight like a shard of glass." Some overwriting in places ("lattice of crystal and silence," "cathedral of light") and repetitive structure in the thread-unraveling sequence. Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose. The ending sequence maintains momentum despite dense imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("mascara had streaked like comet tails," "each letter a living vein") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most high-pressure sentences. Some abstract phrasing ("ethical storytelling could reverse the damage words had done") needs more concrete grounding, though the puppet show descriptions maintain strong visual clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "islands of soil clung to the caldera's lip, anchored by vines that could release their grip at any sigh of the mountain" establishes setting, constraint, and metaphor simultaneously. Some elevated diction in places ("verdant grotto," "translucent moth wing") but serves the meditative tone. Clean prose rhythm with varied sentence lengths creating visual breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density high—most lines advance multiple purposes. However, several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy ("transcribed memory released from tension," "snowmelt ardor"). Some metaphor mixing ("green river of memory," then rope as sound wave). Strong moments like "cracked street organ punched card scrap caught in its own teeth" show control, but inconsistent. Template phrase "technically gentle" appears twice identically.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("lightning sketches the outline of a door that was never built"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Some abstract passages in the middle dream sequences ("cipher," "lock that learns to pick itself") edge toward opacity, and "transcendence" appears twice where more specific language would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose achieves remarkable density with lines doing multiple jobs - "sandals mended with waxed thread and coat patched at the elbows" simultaneously establishes character, economic state, and the interregnum period. No loops or scaffolding detected. The figurative language enhances rather than obscures ("labyrinth of dusk and silence," "walls were lined with lapis mosaics of bulls wearing stars for eyes").

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative control with "velvet lungs," "metallic shrug," "origami cranes that flew without flapping." Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deduction for repetitive use of "shifting grace" (5 instances) and "cellular memory" (4 instances) creating mild template cadence, though they serve thematic accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative coherence in the glass/mirror/breath pattern, but density becomes excessive with metaphors in nearly every sentence of peak beats. Template cadence appears in "She had learned... She would recreate... She found..." sequence. The prose achieves moments of crystalline precision but occasional abstraction ("boundaries between maker and made") and repetitive "began to" constructions reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("leaves whispered of the breach"). Minor template cadence in "She began...She understood...She found" progression. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. The "accidentally, to forgive itself" ending lands effectively despite the adverb.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("trees of living starlight," "memories began to peel away like petals") but suffers from occasional abstraction and repetitive structures. Phrases like "brightened disquiet" appear twice without evolution, and some constructions feel overwrought ("the Codex of Unwritten Inheritances"). The ending accumulates power through rhythm, though middle sections contain scaffold phrases that could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shelves spiraling upward like DNA helixes"). Several abstract philosophical passages slow momentum ("negotiation—a living contract between what humanity remembers and what it chooses to forget"). Some repetitive structures in middle sections ("She begins by... She spends... She discovers...").

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting—"blissfully aberrant chord" and "unkindled solace" feel forced rather than organic. Some metaphors strain coherence (fog that "digests" sound while also "shaping itself into her silhouette"). Information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple layers, though abstract diction occasionally dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "warmly methodical" appears three times creating a template pattern. Some elevated diction ("marginalia," "lectern") fits the academic setting. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the rope-braiding sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Deductions for repetitive use of "gently luminous" (appears 3 times), "bloom of hush" (4 times), and "hammered repose" (3 times) which create pattern fatigue. The unfinished final sentence, while thematically purposeful, technically remains incomplete. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose demonstrates strong momentum with purposeful compression, though occasional ornamental phrases ("skeleton lighthouse in a land with no sea") don't fully earn their weight. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative language borders on overwrought but remains comprehensible.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("Each droplet clung to the carved constellations like a memory refusing to fall") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract drifts. The unfinished final sentence reads as intentional ellipsis but weakens closure impact. Some redundancy appears in memory descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some abstract phrases like "gravity of hopelessness" appear multiple times without variation. Strong moments like "footprint of ember that did not burn the stone but seeded it with tiny suns." Some repetitive constructions around "serious playfulness" and thematic echoes that border on loops.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, template cadence appears in "He understood...He touched...He spoke" sequences and some paraphrase loops ("Time feels like this...rough where it breaks, smooth where it holds" restates the tidepool metaphor). Filter verbs cluster in memory sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("gilded hush" establishing both time and atmosphere).

Overall momentum maintained through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery like "starlight pooled like spilled mercury" but suffers from repetitive constructions ("not as...but as" appears multiple times) and abstract phrasing that occasionally obscures concrete action. Several paraphrase loops occur, particularly around the concept of absence becoming presence. Information density is uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density serves the accumulative mode with lines doing multiple jobs ("spores swarmed, forming lattices...teaching her bones the recipe for diamond"). However, some metaphor mixing ("promise that had not yet decided whether to keep itself") and occasional overwrought phrases reduce clarity without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the opening. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("standing wave blossomed," "shimmer in the lamplight") and occasional abstract constructions ("bridge of intuition between her intent and the memories").

The incomplete final sentence is a significant technical flaw, though most lines carry multiple functions effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful repetition ("She would return tomorrow, and the day after"). Information density is high - most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. Slight overwriting in "slow famine of memory" and occasional filter constructions ("she saw") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied syntax and strong imagery, but suffers from repetitive phrase structures ("He had," "He lifted," "He stepped") and some overwriting in metaphors like "glass lung breathing pale light." The pattern-taught repetitions of key phrases work purposefully but occasionally feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and vivid specificity ("barley grain balanced on a thistle needle"). However, several instances of repetitive phrasing ("Day after day," "emerged transformed always" appears multiple times) and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("fear pricked him...curiosity was stronger, mossy delight curling") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery like "leaves turned like pages" that do multiple jobs. Information density is high with lines advancing both plot and atmosphere. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("coincidence became pattern" appears twice) and some elevated diction in peak moments ("provisional dreams," "calibrated their stopped timepieces") that creates mild register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("mercury... bead like luminous regret"). Some overwriting appears in figurative density ("equations she carried inside her chest," "syllables distilled into guilt") without full payoff. Template cadence emerges in middle sections ("She had come to... She remembered... She placed...") dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("harp strung with moonlight," "melted silver"). Some density issues with stacked metaphors in places. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in confession catalogue section.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs - "The pewter strap vibrated, resonating with the forest's hum, turning his skull into a tuning fork for mercy." Some metaphor density in middle sections approaches oversaturation ("logarithmic spiral," "data points," "diminishing pain") but syntax varies effectively and momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("colors braid into a rope that lashes the lighthouse to the sky") occasionally obscures clarity. Template cadence appears briefly ("I walk...I raise...") and the abrupt ending damages momentum, though the prose otherwise maintains strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with moments of exceptional density ("frozen applause," "taught the spring inside measured heartbeats instead of hours"). Some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("weightless burden," "façade of skepticism like thin ice") and occasional register elevation that strains the technician's voice. Final incomplete sentence reads as intentional ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong figurative control with glass/frost/whisper imagery coherent throughout. Information density high—most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("reality became negotiable," "mutable air") and slight register elevation in philosophical moments that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery and varied sentence structure, but several issues: redundant phrasing ("dust and silence"/"falling ash"), abstract constructions that could be more concrete ("poetically inclined toward elegy"), and some overwriting in the extended metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density high with lines like "rope over her shoulder ticking like a cooling engine." Some figurative density in peak beats ("hinged open," "swung open," "newly hinged") creates mild repetition. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, though occasional abstraction ("where explanations wash their hands of themselves") slightly dulls clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong opening/closing lines. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues include occasional elevated diction ("perpetually learning the language of knots") and some summary passages that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments like "pigment and petal breathing together" demonstrate careful line-level craft, but the story suffers from repetitive phrasing—"across the melting of winter's last snow" appears verbatim twice, and multiple sentences begin with "She" in sequence. The extended denouement after the emotional climax creates momentum drag, though individual sentences often achieve lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The deck was littered with flotsam the wind had carried from the drowned coast" which establishes setting, atmosphere, and materials simultaneously. Minor overwriting appears in figurative clusters ("black water glinting like spilled ink," "gangway to the observation deck that hung like a gull's nest") and some abstract phrasing ("responsibility" rather than embodied consequence) that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of abstract philosophizing slow the line-level propulsion ("comfort offered without wound or work is only another kind of dying"). Some repetitive constructions in the conception sequence ("He imagined... He pictured..."). The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece, and sensory specificity grounds most passages.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("wind-stunted apple trees whose blossoms glowed like pale lanterns"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("cambium pulsed with urgent syntax") but serves the mythic register. Information density is high, though a few phrases could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("clutched the oak acorn cap between gloved fingers, its ridged surface warm despite the sub-zero air").

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high in technical passages that advance both character expertise and plot pressure. However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "the absence between them, the hush that was not empty but full of withheld thunder" could be more concrete. Template cadence appears in "He [verb]" patterns across multiple lines. The opening sentence runs too long without clear anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("spiritually curious in the way roots are curious about stone"). Strong syntactic variety and vivid imagery like "meteors scratched pale signatures across the black parchment" create propulsion, with minimal scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong figurative coherence (bees/honey/amber/wax imagery threads throughout) with purposeful rhythm variation. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Deduction for repetitive "ghost" constructions in middle section and some abstract phrasing ("mute eloquence" appears three times). The incomplete final sentence creates intentional suspension.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression, but several instances of overwriting harm momentum: "exquisite ache of recognizing time's fingerprints," "secret currency to spend on moments that still needed believing."

Minor template cadence in the middle section's repeated "She [verb]" constructions detracts from otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "centrifuges stilled mid-spin as if the scientists had simply stepped into the rain and dissolved" merges setting, history, and atmosphere. Some figurative density in peak beats ("liquid narrative," "fuse trails") but serves the accumulative pattern. The incomplete final sentence prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"planted poppies the color of dried blood" links past/present/symbolic registers efficiently. Rhythm varies naturally between longer ritual descriptions and shorter transformation beats. Some figurative density in peak moments ("seeds answered in Greek, promising return") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, and "gloom-hill" appears only twice despite framing importance.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Old tin roofs click like teeth when the heat expands them toward noon"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm changes. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("amplified silence," "unintelligible sighs") and one instance of slight redundancy in the cylinder description passages.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision: "confusion pooling like ink," "memory rather than prison," and mild repetition of "echoed silence." The "sediment" metaphor for layered sketches works well. Some sentences in the middle section could compress for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong momentum and clarity with varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears ("terrifying, luminous" feels stacked). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong imagery but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure ("like hibernating serpents," "black as the space between stars"). The truncated final sentence and occasional overwrought metaphors ("hidden thunder of every word she'd swallowed") reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deducting for occasional overwriting ("polished regret," "productive fidget") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("winnow the guilt from his soul").

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"forged hush," "fracture the Council's monopoly on absolution"—with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("forgiveness need not demand erasure"/"forgiveness was not something to be earned through erasure"), and abstract phrases like "beautifully, tragically human" lack specificity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong moments of compression ("my master's final lesson, spoken while his lungs crystallized into glass"). Some filter-verb accumulation ("I feel," "I stand," "I begin") in transitions between major beats reduces immediacy. The "uncertain alchemist apprenticed to silence" construction appears twice with slight variation, creating minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation and no significant loops or scaffolding.

Minor paraphrase loops appear ("She crossed, not running, not walking, but drifting") and some abstract phrasing reduces clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"branches...dangled like nooses" conveys both physical state and psychological threat. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("fragile grace") and one instance of slight overwriting in "fists of wind."

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Some filter-verb clustering mid-story ("he feels," "he understands," "he realizes") and occasional redundancy ("softly persistent" appears twice verbatim). The final unfinished "lantern extinguished" creates purposeful incompletion that works structurally.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor deductions for occasional elevation that borders on overwriting ("petals of light unfurling") and one instance of filter construction, but overall control is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong imagery and atmospheric control, but suffers from repetitive phrase patterns ("she had," "she felt," "she saw") and occasional overwriting ("delicate yet edged with menace" used twice). The density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("ribbon of violet flame that stitched the bleeding starlight") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, though key moments land with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs, like "comet's tail" simultaneously describing movement and celestial nature. Some abstract phrases like "density of presence" and "directed spontaneity" risk opacity, though the controlled rhythm and varied syntax maintain strong momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagery and varied syntax, but occasional overwriting ("feral nostalgia clawed at her ribs"). The unfinished final sentence appears intentional but disrupts momentum. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures support the accumulative mode, though some metaphorical density ("watercolor bruises," "frozen metronomes") occasionally slows momentum. The phrase "read between the lines" appears four times, creating intentional pattern but risking mechanical repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "melted starlight" ink and pages hovering "like moths." Information density high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deduction for three instances of "crow quill trimmed tip" which, while intentional, creates mild template cadence. Some filter verbs ("felt," "saw") could be eliminated for greater immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down felt like a held breath." Some density issues with figurative language clustering ("pearled along the ghost's translucent lashes," "phosphor," "apple seed" in rapid succession).

    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines like "twelve clicks of the tide gauge, eleven gull cries, ten heartbeats" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak moments ("folding back into the moon's silver throat") approaches oversaturation, and phrases like "eminently peculiar" repeat without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Standout lines like "mushrooms around them flared, brighter than sunrise, and the air thickened with the scent of rain on copper" show excellent sensory layering. Some abstract passages ("spreading so thin you become the space between atoms") and occasional repetitive structures ("She... She...") create minor friction but don't compromise clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though "clover melancholy" and similar abstractions weaken opening momentum. Some overwriting in metaphors ("puddles reflected stacks like green aquariums"). The piece avoids major loops but occasionally reaches for elevated register ("lucid contradictions," "traverse") that creates mild artificiality. Information density is good overall.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with high information density, though some figurative density in peak beats ("melodically haunted," "lullaby remembering it had once been a scream") occasionally tips toward overwriting. The final image elegantly compresses meaning: "every terminus is a disguised origin."

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with memorable phrases like "aged backward into absence," though density occasionally tips into overwriting: "sweet with blossom and sharp with the coming storm" plus multiple metaphorical layers in quick succession. Some filter constructions ("She felt," "She saw") dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("moonlight pooled like spilled milk") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in peak beats without payoff.

Some phrases feel overwrought ("parliament of sparrows descended, each carrying a single silver pin"), though information density remains generally high.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("uncharted emotional depths," "quiet blaze of determination") and some overwriting in metaphorical density reduce clarity. The filter verb "felt" appears frequently. Line-level craft is competent but occasionally strains for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though metaphorical overwriting appears in peak beats ("dominoes arranged by a drunk god," "wrists of causality"). The prose achieves momentum despite occasional register drift into elevated diction that strains the fantastical POV.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("bubbles rising in dotted half notes") but suffers from abstract passages ("distilled joy," "reluctant soloist") and some template phrasing ("He signed," "He stepped," "He lifted"). Information density is high when concrete but diluted by philosophical abstractions that don't advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("volcanic tenderness trembling in her chest like magma beneath thin crust"). Minor template cadence in middle sections ("She began...She painted...She lifted") but information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but abstract phrasing occasionally obscures concrete action ("auric lagoon raised a small golden hand"). Some figurative density in peak beats without clear payoff, and periodic register elevation that doesn't fully align with POV lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong sensory writing and varied syntax create momentum, particularly in the storm opening and the starlight footfall sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("darkness thick as velvet," "cotton candy" for static) and occasional filter constructions ("she felt," "she saw") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    Information density is high with lines consistently doing multiple jobs ("coat heavy with river mist, eyes fixed on the ripples that refused to settle"). Some elevated diction ("membrane between worlds") occasionally strains but never obscures meaning. The syntactic variety and purposeful repetition of key terms (spiral, shutter, reflection) create propulsive rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The grotto's pull felt like the library's whisper made physical"). However, some figurative density in peak beats borders on overwriting ("cradle the idea like a fragile rook, protecting it until it could castle"), and occasional abstract phrasing ("where past meets prophecy") recurs without always advancing pressure. No major loops or scaffolding, but some sentences could be tightened for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The island shimmered, edges fraying" conveys both physical detail and time pressure. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("sublittoral fringe," "bladder wrack") though it serves the mythic tone.

    Information density high with lines like "pillars singing in frequencies that made the ice beneath them shiver into lace" doing multiple jobs. Some register elevation ("colonnade's ellipse," "membrane") but it serves the mythic tone. Minor repetition in "aesthetically driven" (appears twice) and slight overwriting in extended metaphors, though the lyric mode earns most flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("The sound was the color she had always missed") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Template structures appear ("She set...She placed...She laid") and some metaphors strain clarity ("seeds of second sight"), though the closure sequence maintains strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("golden shadows ripple," "moth wings, strong as tectonic plates") but suffers from density issues—abstract philosophical passages slow momentum and some metaphors strain ("grid inside her has finally found its frequency"). The truncated ending and occasional overwriting prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "jet beads and empty of hope" links physical and emotional weight. Syntax varies purposefully, from short declarations ("Morning came") to complex accumulations. Some figurative density in places ("curtains of intention," "withering she meant to teach to bloom") occasionally obscures immediate sense. The template phrase "she + verb" appears in clusters but doesn't dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs—"rain distorted the inches into trembling silver rivers" works visually, thematically, and atmospherically. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("ticker symbols," "black stars that drank the lamplight") and occasional abstract phrasing ("the inherited mystery was this"). Template cadence appears briefly with repeated "She [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("veil...fluttered like a wounded moth") but density becomes excessive in places with multiple metaphors per sentence. Some paraphrase loops around the nostalgia concept ("atoms of nostalgia" appears 5 times). The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, though the middle section has some scaffolding around the memory descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("frozen dragonflies," "talons"). Some overwriting in figurative density ("shelves of glass petals holding every reverie ever surrendered"). Minor template cadence in middle action sequences. Information density is high but occasionally tips into ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments of compression and imagery but suffers from template cadence runs ("She lifted... She breathed... She set... She opened... She calibrated...") and some overwriting in figurative density. Information density is uneven, with some paraphrase loops around the betrayal concept. The writing achieves clarity but lacks consistent propulsion, particularly in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the coffee rings passage. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of key phrases. Some figurative density in places ("meteor hush" appears twice) but generally serves the accumulative design. Minor template cadence in the plant descriptions but within acceptable bounds for the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The booth's only window framed the dormant screen like a moonlit lake"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("nightjar warms an alien egg," "stalactite") but coherent within the psychometry frame. Minor scaffold in the extended spatial metaphor sequence (balcony/clavicle section) but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some figurative density in peak beats ("bruised violet," "shadow swallows rapture") approaches overwriting. Template cadence appears briefly ("She heard...She heard..."). Information density is high but occasionally tips into opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The mechanism swallows it, gears blooming into vines of light that thread through the corridor walls" combines action, transformation, and visual poetry. Some mild repetition in "occasionally everywhere" serves the pattern but risks slight overuse. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the accumulative final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "mechanical macaws whose wings were printed circuits; they spelled out coordinates in binary that translated to 'follow the probable miracles.'" Some figurative density in peak beats ("every gear a seed, every piston a heartbeat") but serves the accumulative pattern without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves lyric density with purposeful repetition ("gently persistent," "indirect routes") that teaches pattern. Strong figurative coherence throughout ("lanterns swaying like slow metronomes," "light pooling like spilled milk"). Some slight redundancy in the guides' return journey description, but momentum sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("His name was erased when he took the post"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("snow that tasted of salt and old songs") without clear payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("He could...Or he could...") but the overall prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in figurative language clusters ("dust motes drifted like miniature galaxies," "silver spears," "black tears"). Template cadence in middle section with repetitive "he [verb]" constructions. Strong opening and closing lines partially redeem.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments of compression ("windless night folded around her") and specific technical detail create momentum, but the prose occasionally overreaches with abstract phrases like "periodically eternal" and "delayed revelation" that feel forced. The recurring tapping pattern (three short, two long, pause, one short) provides concrete rhythm. Some sentences strain for effect ("the moment periodically eternal") creating mild opacity in places.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong prose rhythm that breathes with the scene—longer sentences for observation, shorter for action. Information density high throughout, with most sentences doing double work. Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("margin of daylight bled violet") borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. The unfinished final sentence works as deliberate truncation.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("ancestral breath," "chlorophyll courage"). Information density high throughout. Deductions for filter-verb clustering in the embryo-thoughts sequence ("felt," "feeling," "hearing") and slight register drift in "living negotiation between memory and possibility."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence length and purposeful paragraph breaks, particularly in the breathing exercise sequence. Some metaphors edge toward overwriting ("pearl of stillness" recurs without evolving), and phrases like "patient errors" strain for profundity.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Salt water kissed her ankles, then her knees; the necessary darkness tasted of brine and ink"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("walls inching inward like ribs," "shelves... like ribs" repetition) and occasional register elevation ("phosphoresce") slightly strain the POV's naturalism.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Alba + verb" patterns) and overwritten passages like "creating a rhythm that made her chest tighten with recognition." Multiple filter constructions ("she felt," "she saw," "she understood") dull immediacy in crucial beats. The incomplete final sentence creates an artifact that damages closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several issues: template cadence in middle section ("She had slid it... She removed the envelope... She felt herself"), some overwriting ("dizzy and total," "lullaby sharpened to a knife"), and occasional unclear metaphors. The "within the blink that follows surprise" repetition feels forced rather than resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("pocket universe where every thorn was a promise") but suffers from occasional abstraction and repetitive structures. Some filter-heavy passages ("she imagined," "she reminded herself") and conceptual redundancy around memory/continuity themes dilute immediacy. The ending's shift to present tense feels unmotivated.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "iron warmed by her pulse, because iron remembers the first scream of trains and the last lullaby of tracks." Some figurative density in places ("transliterated emotions into audible color") but serves the accumulative pattern rather than obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of overwriting: "airy suspension of a skeptical pause," "telescopic orbits of regret," "elegant violence of thought." Some metaphor density in non-peak moments ("starlight stitched silver footprints") without clear payoff. The mathematical proof sequence and closure remain clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the laboratory of lost sounds" establishes setting, tone, and thematic concern simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("folding of time," "meteor hush") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("old guilt," "grief") and slight repetition of "cry" without variation, though this serves the obsessive focus.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in peak beats ("whispering grotto, where lilac mist clung to every breath like a secret"). Template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, and some metaphors strain ("socially perceptive antennae").

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("stars dripped through seams," "history folded like wet parchment"). Some overwriting in places ("mercy twisted askew—the aberrant mercy") creates density issues. Template cadence appears briefly ("Where the leaf ended, we placed jade chips; where sky fractured, we laid cerulean"). Information density generally high with purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"petals of moonlit apple drifting through her translucent ribs like pale fireflies" establishes setting, character state, and atmosphere simultaneously. Some metaphoric density in peak beats ("mirror vines," "stage light rustling through dew") borders on oversaturation but maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong sensory density and varied sentence rhythm, particularly in the somatic marker sequences. Information density is high with most lines doing double work. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("fractally precise," "somatic marker") and there's minor redundancy in the skepticism descriptions, but momentum generally sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"fossil floated above the hearth every solstice, spinning like a compass that refused north" establishes object, tradition, and mystical quality simultaneously. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("the unknown's voice by letting it speak through her") creates minor register drift. Template cadence appears briefly in the dream sequence listing. Overall propulsion remains strong with varied paragraph lengths creating visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or the accumulating prophecy. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("bled into the stone," "insects in the resinous walls") and the unfinished final sentence "The hour" which appears to be a copy error.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments of precise imagery ("roots gripped the cliff like desperate fingers," "mist muffled every footfall") create momentum, though several instances of elevated diction ("pewter, neither day nor night," "desperate fingers") edge toward overwriting. Minor paraphrase loop in "fixing what's broken begins with admitting the fracture" followed shortly by "Fixing what's broken...was not erasing the scar." The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs, though "unused courage rose between them" abstracts what could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("fog percolates through my coat, through my ribs, until even my thoughts feel damp"). Some metaphors strain (palimpsest promises repeated four times), but the final image of the coachman with the needle effectively recharges earlier material.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Some overwriting in figurative density—"spider silk," "wax ghosts," "overlapping bowls on a wheel" cluster without always advancing pressure. The "phototropic" repetition works as taught pattern. Minor scaffold in "understood then" and "understanding that" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "the last petal of the century-old rosebush drifting past her cheek like a silent goodbye" establishes time, loss, and tone simultaneously. Rhythm varies from long, flowing sentences to short declarations ("A faint vibration answered"). Some minor repetition of "quivering hush" and "rhythm of oars" serves the accumulative pattern rather than creating loops.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The metal surface showed her not her own face but the memory of the reincarnation"). Some figurative language edges toward density in places ("like warm snow," "like low stars" in quick succession), but the writing maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows strong moments like "boots splashing puddles that held entire skies" but suffers from opacity in key beats. The sentence about the twig "secreted every vow she had ever disguised in perfume ink" uses imprecise diction (secreted for held/contained). Several constructions require multiple readings: "rejoin narratives their authors fled" and "allowable quiet truths." The final paragraph's abstract confidence undermines concrete closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves solid clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, though some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("silky oscillation that tasted like burnt sugar"). Information density is high - most sentences advance plot while building atmosphere. Minor scaffold in "cautiously hopeful" appearing twice identically, but overall momentum remains strong through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("starlight bled through in silver shards") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract constructions ("claustrophobia momentarily unhooked from her ribs"). Information density is generally strong, though some metaphors strain credibility and several passages could be tightened without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("stone teeth ready to swallow names") but suffers from occasional overwriting and register drift. Template cadence appears in the painting sequence ("First came... Next... Last"). The truncated final sentence creates an artifact that dulls closure momentum, triggering the patterned-artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong opening and closing lines with varied sentence structure throughout. Information density high in descriptive passages, though some middle sections contain mild redundancy ("nervously confident" appears three times). Prose maintains momentum through active verbs and specific imagery like "needles jittering" and "shadows pooling like spilled ink."

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("squares of silver that rearranged themselves into a lattice of impossible doors"). However, density sometimes overwhelms clarity—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without breathing room. Template constructions appear ("She lifted," "She tucked," "She stepped"). The phrase "luminous disbelief" repeats without evolution, and abstract concepts occasionally muddle concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments: "dusky harmony, a chord struck between cooling iron and warming whiskey." Some overwriting in metaphor density ("tired flags of a forgotten country," "paper fence of many nations") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor template cadence in "She stepped...she spoke" construction.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though some metaphoric density in peak beats ("night poured in, thick as ink") and occasional template structures ("She understood then"). The final incomplete sentence reads as intentional but disrupts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm modulation during key beats. Some figurative excess appears ("serpents," "conspirators," "exhausted spears") and the phrase "warlike serenity" repeats without evolution, but line-level craft supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. However, abstract concepts like "futures too impatient to wait" and "intersection of dreams" create occasional opacity. The final truncation ("even eclips") appears unintentional. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("braided into the seed, weaving a new covenant") slightly impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagistic density and information-rich lines ("roots cradling the bone as fiercely gentle as a mother who knows the child will never wake"). Some metaphor strain appears ("shadow leaping across skulls as if arguing") and occasional register elevation ("benediction," "cambium") that doesn't fully match Lira's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, though some metaphor density in early paragraphs ("song that refused to fade," "stage lights dying") clusters without full payoff. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence appears in "He wasn't... He wasn't... He was" construction but serves intentional rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with high information density and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("haunted ambitions," "simpler ache") and some filter-verb clustering in middle sections. The opening and closing lines are exceptional, creating effective bookends. Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"crucibles glowed with the heat of compressed dawns" combines setting, atmosphere, and conceptual work. No loops or scaffolding, though the incomplete final sentence prevents full excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some overwriting in figurative language ("reluctant monarch of silence," "ventricle" metaphor) creates mild density issues. Strong rhythm variation and syntactic control. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("ivy had swallowed the station whole," "each rail a rib"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in middle sections ("daringly methodical" appears twice) and occasional abstract phrasing, but prose propels effectively toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some figurative density in peak beats ("moonlit cobwebs," "electric anticipation") and occasional template phrasing ("she understood then"). The propagation delay concept creates purposeful repetition that mostly lands, but "cyclically reversed" appears mechanically.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "light refracted, projecting a lattice of melting runes onto the velvet walls." Some figurative density borders on oversaturation ("scales made of starlight and chlorophyll") but serves the accumulative mode. The abrupt truncation and occasional abstract moments ("propagate something unnamed") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some paraphrase loops appear ("Finding patterns in static was her oldest habit" followed by extended restatement). Strong information density in key passages like the faces blooming sequence. Minor scaffold in phrases like "she understood then" and "rose unbidden" but these don't touch closure. The final image of the salon efficiently compresses future and past without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery and varied syntax. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for "scalloped" appearing 8 times (pattern feels forced rather than taught), and slight overwriting in metaphorical density ("moonlight pooled like spilled wine and silence tasted of crushed grapes").

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery, but several abstract constructions weaken immediacy ("the weight of that verdict pressed against her ribs like the cloak of doubt"). The unfinished final sentence ("deciphering wind chime selections once") breaks momentum entirely. Some phrases edge toward purple ("embers sighing like secrets").

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong figurative control in places ("ghost ripples arriving before the cause"), but repetitive phrasing appears: multiple "Elara-Lira [verb]" constructions, "sycamore hush" used twice identically. The incomplete final sentence is a critical technical failure that prevents clean closure.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    Purposeful repetition creates rhythm but occasionally tips into mechanical loops ("centuries of layered dust" appears 5 times, "pulse left wandering" 6 times). Strong moments like "towers of bone rose like frozen screams" and the birds writing "equations of wind" show vivid precision, though some passages lean on abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "mist walking, the art of believing the vapor beneath you is solid enough to bear regret," but occasional overwriting ("brilliant dimness that made his eyes ache") and the incomplete final sentence harm momentum. Some figurative density in peak beats without clear payoff reduces clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("each paper bloom drifting upward like a slow meteor hush" establishes setting, tone, and thematic echo). Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor repetition of "wandered purposefully" and occasional filter verbs ("she thought," "remembering") create slight drag but don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("ambered observatory deck creaked under the weight of after-time"). Some abstract passages like "distillate of purpose suspended in the light" strain clarity, and occasional template structures ("She understood then that...") appear, though momentum generally holds.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs—"echo of sacrifice trembled in the rafters" establishes atmosphere while advancing theme. Some figurative density in places ("frost ferns," "starlight swallowed by a well") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor scaffold in "he understood" construction.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with memorable images and high information density. However, several template constructions appear ("Calen stood," "Calen had been," "He sets," "He begins") and some paraphrase loops ("brittle as spun sugar, sweet until it shatters" restates the brittle concept). The "one Mississippi, two Mississippi" counting and some filter constructions ("feels its weight shift") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Some elegant phrasing but hampered by abstract constructions ("memory kept in one throat is only echo") and occasional overwriting ("slow plankton," "scabbed-over wounds"). The prose artifact "fracture had never been in the concrete but in the silence" dulls immediacy at a crucial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for overwrought figurative language in places ("spilled ink," "mortar dissolving into starlight") and some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("touch of wonder still eluded her"). The density of metaphor occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong propulsion with vivid, purposeful imagery, but several instances of paraphrase loops ("covenant must be revised"/"begins to revise") and template cadence in middle sections. Information density is high in peak beats, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("soundless echo," "absolute stillness, a hush deeper than any apology").

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from conceptual redundancy and abstract phrasing. "Custody dissolved into stewardship; ownership became guardianship" paraphrases the same shift. Template cadence appears in the ending sequence: "They stayed...When the scroll...Kael and Kael-2 smiled." Information density varies wildly—some sentences pack multiple layers while others merely restate. The philosophical register occasionally obscures concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("glossy as obsidian," "petals that stank of carrion and thunder"). However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "across the hush of a possibility just born" appears twice, "notably receptive" feels forced. Some overwriting in metaphorical density during high-pressure beats without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control in places ("She yanked once; the engine coughed, refused") but suffers from density issues. Mixed metaphors appear ("brick throat," "pale quivering notes," "haunting made of sound chasing its own tail") without clear pattern-teaching. The incomplete final sentence and occasional overwriting ("true haunting made of sound chasing its own tail") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("frost's silver script across shoulders that had carried whole shelves"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("membrane becoming drumskin") occasionally approaches overwriting but remains pattern-consistent. Minor template cadence in "The guardian [verb]" constructions across several paragraphs prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("footprints filling with quicksilver light") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated diction. Some redundancy appears ("hopeless alchemist" repeated, "frozen bloom" recurs). The phrase "the penny dropped" appears twice without clear pattern-teaching, creating mild template feel.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("soft avalanche of possibility") and the repeated "serenely electric" phrase that becomes slightly mechanical. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for scattered template constructions ("Cass felt," "She understood," "Passengers saw") and some paraphrase-adjacent lines around timeline concepts. The "three short, three long, three short" SOS pattern adds specificity. Information density is high but occasionally tips into mild overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity, but repetitive structures appear ("Mara nodded," "Mara watched," "Mara felt") and some filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments. The unfinished final sentence reads as intentional but may frustrate rather than resonate. Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong propulsion and density with images doing multiple jobs (the anchor link as grief-weight, memory-object, and navigation tool). Some elevated diction edges toward register drift ("benthic," "Euclidean certainty," "tectonic sigh") but remains mostly within an instructor's plausible lexicon. The final teaching image lands cleanly without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though some overwriting appears ("mist-clad," "transparently"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "pulse/pulsed" and some elevated diction ("incidental heroism") that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation and high information density. However, some figurative density in peak beats ("constellation of light," "binary lullabies," "neural pathways") creates mild coherence friction. Template cadence appears briefly ("She began to sing...The cables responded...Each connection"). No issues touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information-dense prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some metaphorical density in peak beats ("porcelain kissed porcelain") slightly obscures immediacy. Template cadence appears briefly in the "I + verb" pattern mid-story. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("copper-veined," "bone towers," "phonetic dust"). Some figurative density in early passages but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor repetition of "quietly articulate" and slight overwriting in "each echo thinner than the last" but momentum remains strong. Information density high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("frost blooming into glassy petals that refracted memories"). However, abstract phrases like "harmony untamed" and "gravitationally playful" create opacity in peak beats. Some elevated register drift ("metamorphose," "rewritten") doesn't fully match the established voice. Information density remains high throughout with good propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and stakes). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without full payoff ("memory strong as branch"). Occasional abstract phrasing ("gap between knowing and understanding") and slight overuse of "resonantly soft" create minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("thunderstorm in a bottle," "guilty thought" for the drone) though occasionally dense ("respectfully rebellious" appears three times). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some mild template cadence in the middle section ("Six nodded...Six knelt...Six felt") costs points, though the prose achieves genuine momentum and the closing images resonate without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery: "frost glittered," "iron door sprung open like a gasp." However, several instances of elevated diction strain clarity: "misting hush," "whispering gleam," and some density overload in metaphorical language during high-pressure beats. The phrase "quietly persistent" appears twice, creating minor repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("equations unfolded into narratives: a love letter written in the spectral lines of hydrogen"). Some elevated diction risks register drift ("provisionally," "hyperbolic geometry") but stays mostly within experimental science-poetry fusion. Minor paraphrase loop with "stories live" concept stated twice in similar terms.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("watercolor palette strapped like a compass across her heart"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("thin auroras dripping from her brush like liquid memory") without clear payoff. Template repetition in "She [verb]" constructions appears but doesn't dominate.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, some figurative density approaches overwriting ("shadows lengthening like curious fingers," "voice trembling like dew on spider silk"). Template cadence appears in places ("He saw her... He saw her later"). The prose serves the lyric mode but occasionally tips into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("chronically curious" appears three times, "crisp nostalgia" echoes). Some elevated diction feels forced ("freighted with the crisp nostalgia of cider"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence carries figurative language, creating exhaustion. Phrases like "combative tenderness" appear twice, and some constructions feel overwrought ("the hush is absolute"). The scaffold phrase "Lira [verb]" appears too frequently in the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful but occasionally over-figured ("absinthe" sky color, "reciprocal gift"). Some metaphor stacking in peak beats ("wings of dawn and dusk"). Information density high; each sentence advances atmosphere or transformation. Template cadence avoided.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy: "centuries of unfinished mourning had pooled," "accumulated silence hovered." Some repetitive constructions ("knot sighed open," "knot, another bead"). The prose serves the accumulative mode but could be tighter in places.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with evocative imagery ("Rain hissed against the vaulted ceiling"), but some density issues appear: "shapeless, unmoving" shadow description and mild redundancy in "deliberately omitted" following "erased." The filter verb "seemed to whisper" and abstract phrasing like "shielded openness" occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "The library's rusted chandelier swings though no current moves; it, too, comprehends that everything must eventually drown" layers physical detail, atmosphere, and thematic resonance. Some elevated diction ("verdigris," "bioluminescence") fits the analytical POV. Minor template moments ("I step," "I sit," "I pocket") don't significantly harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("driftingly alert presence that flickered"). Some abstract constructions could be more concrete ("the need felt urgent" vs showing urgency). The variation in sentence structure and paragraph length creates good visual rhythm. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments ("ice crackling off cables," "shoulders hunched like folded wings") but occasional abstraction weakens momentum ("affectionate detachment" appears twice). Information density is generally high with purposeful imagery, though some metaphors stretch ("a mast in a gale of memory").

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "clouds gathered like mourners at a funeral she hadn't been invited to attend." Template cadence appears in middle section with repeated "how the [cloud type] [verb]" constructions. Some abstract phrasing ("spooled wholeness made manifest") and slight overwriting in figurative density reduces clarity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"stars blooming like frost"—but suffers from density overload with figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats. Some paraphrase loops appear ("fractally precise" repetition, multiple "hush" uses), and abstract phrases like "heightened stillness of a moment balanced on the edge of vanishing" occasionally obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, but several issues: redundant phrasing ("She took up"/"took up her graphite"), filter verb clusters in discovery beats, and the awkwardly truncated final line. Template cadence appears in mid-section ("She reopened it"/"She remembered"/"She tucked") reducing propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative control and information density, though occasional overwriting appears ("floored with frost that rang like crystal bells"). Some template cadence in the mirror sequence ("She saw...She saw") but the prose achieves genuine momentum through the repair sequence. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively supports the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for register drift into elevated/poetic diction that occasionally obscures clarity ("brambled hope," "slow-motion waterfall"), some filter-verb clustering ("decided to reexamine"), and the incomplete final sentence that breaks momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs—"The broken puppet head stirred in her grasp, eyelids clicking open to reveal marbles that had watched empires fall." Some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("bruised awe," "nested patterns," "fibrillation") and occasional abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("beautifully flawed machinery"). No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery and varied syntax create momentum, though some metaphors strain ("roots burrowed...like guilty prayers"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Minor repetition of "forgotten blueprints" concept and occasional abstract phrasing ("graceless beauty"). The final image of "footprints carved from moonlight" resonates but verges on overwriting. Clear propulsion through the rescue sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments but suffers from repetitive use of "symphonically minded" (3x), some abstract phrasing ("polymer of memory instead of loss"), and occasional overwriting in figurative density. The "loosened grief" construction appears 4 times with minimal variation. Information density is generally good but these patterns create drag.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagistic density and rhythmic control, but some paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "clean slate vendor" appears three times with minimal variation, "stories begin/can begin/have begun" cycles without adding pressure. Template cadence in "I [verb]" constructions mid-story. The prose excels in invention ("moon-metal," "lull lightning") but occasionally sacrifices clarity for density.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("sandstone walls steaming like fresh bread"). Some minor repetition around "remorse" and "memory" but largely justified by the accumulative pattern. The prose propels through sensory specificity rather than action.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.6)
    Lines like "borrowed starlight so gentle it pooled like milk" demonstrate strong imagery, but density becomes excessive—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. The prose occasionally loops, as when both "harmonious" appears twice in close proximity describing the librarian role.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("moonlight poured through the cracks like liquid memory") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. Multiple sentences begin with "The engineer" or "She," creating template cadence. Several paraphrase loops appear ("abandoned dreams" concept restated multiple times). Information density is moderate; some sentences do single duty where compression would strengthen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive use of "clandestinely luminous" (3x), some abstract phrasing ("latent blaze smoldering"), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The insulator once crowned a telegraph pole, carrying human voices across valleys; now it carries only its own history of storms." Some filter verb accumulation ("she feels," "she believes") slightly dulls immediacy. The truncated final sentence disrupts otherwise clean prose. Excellent syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths that create visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, but several instances of abstract elevation harm momentum: "covenant between sky and stone was eclipsed here" lacks concrete grounding. Some paraphrase loops like "hopeful melancholy" appearing multiple times. Strong moments like "iron filings of memory scattered across the plateau" show capability but inconsistent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong rhythm variation and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs ("starlight dripped through skylight cracks, painting silver scars across iron tools laid out like reluctant soldiers"). However, some figurative density approaches overwriting ("theatrical sincerity of a moment poised between detonation and dawn") and occasional template cadence appears ("She lifted...She adjusted...She realized").

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density high: "rope bridges swayed like slow pendulums and lanterns of fireflies blinked in violet dusk" layers setting, atmosphere, and time. Some figurative density in peak moments ("tide's thought," "ghost of fragrance") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor repetition of "serenity" and "doodle" variants, though thematically justified. Strong rhythm variation supports the meditative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"glided above the silverleaf canopy, leaves now shimmering with embedded flecks of metal." Some filter verb accumulation ("caught her eye," "felt," "heard") slightly dulls immediacy. Strong momentum throughout with varied syntax supporting scene rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation and information density. "The silk lifted, kinked, and settled" shows excellent economy. Some elevated diction ("singular convergence," "cultivate foresight") occasionally strains against the investigator's practical nature. No loops or scaffolding, strong propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery ("paper bird, delicate yet fierce"), though some passages edge toward overwriting ("liquid glass" metaphor slightly strains). Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Some repetition of "sculpted hush" and variations, though it serves the accumulative pattern. The ending image of the bell's "bronze heart, oscillating between stillness and awe forever" resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and strong sensory detail, though some paraphrase loops appear ("avalanchingly quiet" used three times identically). The opening and closing images effectively bracket the piece with resonant specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "the sentence read 'I was never here,' yet the spacing between letters spelled 'stay'" demonstrate layered craft. Information density high throughout with lines doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing around emotional transposition ("variables of heartbeat and hesitation") and occasional register elevation ("lucid turbulence of absolute dark") that doesn't fully match the POV's technical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching emotional beats. Some density issues: "the aurora folded backward into first light, memory and myth braided inseparably" compresses too much. Occasional elevated diction ("germinate," "sympathetic vibration") serves theme but occasionally slows momentum. Information density is high without becoming opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("each crystal a syllable in a language older than regret") but suffers from density overload in places. Some metaphors strain ("heartbeat made of light"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for figurative language appearing in most sentences of high-pressure beats and occasional abstract scaffolding ("what remains is not certainty, but...").

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the word had lodged inside her like a swallowed thorn"). However, abstract flourishes occasionally slow momentum ("the hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "latent sacrifice") and some repetitive structures appear ("She carried...," "She walked...," "She tucked..."). The final paragraph's philosophical reach slightly dilutes the concrete power of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though some figurative density in emotional beats ("grief she carried like slag in her chest," "tensile strength threading her veins") and occasional abstract phrasing. The repetition of "quietly determined" works thematically but creates minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves lyrical momentum but suffers from abstract density in places: "the weight of the withheld truth settling into her bones" and similar metaphorical constructions accumulate without always advancing concrete detail. The filtering through "felt," "heard," "knew" occasionally dulls immediacy, particularly in the resolution sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with most lines serving multiple functions. Some figurative density issues: "luminescent ache" appears twice, mixed metaphor of "ache drip—slow, silver, luminescent." The "throat that had swallowed the moon" opening, while atmospheric, creates initial opacity. Otherwise clean prose with good momentum and varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Dense, imagistic prose with strong momentum, though occasional overwriting appears ("fossilized leviathans, drowned constellations"). Some metaphor density in peak beats borders on excessive ("the black sun waited, not a sphere but an open pupil") but clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, some abstract phrasing ("magnetize stories," "borrowed heartbreak dye the fabric") and occasional register elevation ("nadir," "iridescent strand") create minor friction without fully obscuring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong image density, particularly in "lightning struck the observatory dome" and "dust motes danced in moonbeams like tiny planets." Some conceptual redundancy appears in adjacent lines about trees as witnesses (paragraphs 14-15), and occasional register drift into abstract philosophy ("quantified sorrow wasn't about reducing grief to numbers") dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong imagistic density with lines doing multiple jobs—"bark etched with runes that spelled out lullabies in languages that had never been spoken aloud" builds world, atmosphere, and stakes simultaneously. Deduction for two instances of abstract telling ("bound release" construction, "sorrow and joy braided so tightly") and one paraphrase loop around the swaddling concept that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"feeling the nested paradoxes beating gently against her ribs" combines physical sensation, thematic echo, and emotional state. Minor template cadence in the parallel "to leave is to remain" construction and slight overwriting in "enlarged tranquility swelled, not ominous but oceanic," but propulsion remains strong through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Deductions for overwriting in places: "heuristically gentle, as if gentleness itself were a formula" feels overwrought; some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("the weight of ordinary things made sacred by loss"). Information density is mostly strong but occasional philosophical abstraction interrupts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both setting and emotional state). However, filter verb clusters appear ("she realized," "she understood," "she felt") and the incomplete final sentence disrupts closure. Some metaphorical density ("crystallized veins," "mercury tears") edges toward overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("lanterns swinging from rusted hooks, their glow the color of bruised peaches"). Some figurative language borders on overwriting ("comforting unease" appears twice), but generally maintains strong momentum. The apparently truncated final line ("some sil") suggests a technical error rather than intentional elision.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstraction creeps in ("tolerable season," "shared atmosphere"). Some figurative density in non-pressure moments ("silver moth orbiting my wrist") but generally serves the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers, but overwriting intrudes: "auroral sorrow" and similar elevated diction occasionally obscures rather than illuminates. Some metaphor mixing occurs (lock as bird, then as heartbeat, then as locket). The prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty—"indigo, apricot, bruise"—but inconsistent control and occasional template phrases ("insisting she rectify") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose density high—most sentences advance multiple layers (setting, emotion, plot). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Some filter constructions ("she felt," "she realized") slightly dull immediacy in middle sections, preventing higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting: "frost-rimmed lashes," "tender rose that had no name in any tongue" accumulate figurative density without always advancing pressure. Some abstract phrasing ("color of wonder," "symphonies of truth") creates mild opacity. Information density is high and no paraphrase loops detected.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("petals the color of dried blood") but occasional overwriting ("sigils," "will-o'-the-wisp") and density issues in figurative language. The incomplete final sentence creates ambiguity about whether it's intentional ellipsis or error, undermining closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("sandstorm had blown in overnight, draping the sky in muted amber"). Sentence variety creates natural rhythm. Deduction for two instances of slight overwriting: "cancerous silence" and "rinsed and ringing" push figurative density without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density and purposeful compression, but some abstract phrases reduce clarity: "lunar shame," "vulnerability a weapon to be hoarded." The prose rhythm effectively mirrors Lyra's choreographed movements. Deduction for occasional register drift and one instance of abstract philosophizing that doesn't fully land in concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and information density. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("gleaming silence" appears twice) and some elevated diction clusters ("lilacs...translucent salt columns...imprisoning"). No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.3)
    Line-level craft shows strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery like "catching starlight like dew." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, some passages contain ornamental figurative language ("the cool fire of understanding") and occasional template phrasing ("With deliberate slowness," "Around her"). The prose occasionally prioritizes atmosphere over clarity in action sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She smiled the way people smile when the answer is older than language"). Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("meteors spelled sentences across the dark") but pattern is taught early and pays off at closure with architectural conversation.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density and varied syntax, but several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("tragically radiant" appears twice, "ghostly resolve"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections dulls immediacy. The final passages achieve excellent propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("ink lifted from the page like smoke") but suffers from overwriting in places—"pearl twilight that made every surface seem wet with memory" mixes metaphors without clear sense. Template repetition appears in "She had [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, and abstract formulations like "the unfinished finally finish itself" reduce clarity in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "echoes endured"/"memory refuses to be still" restates without advancement. Template cadence appears in "She sang...She stepped...She remembered" sequence. The prose achieves moments of excellence ("starlight dripped like molten glass") but accumulates enough minor artifacts to prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("glass warped until the tiny village inside resembles a drowned hull"), but figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity—"glacier's frozen breath traces sigils" appears alongside "dragons of wax" and "borrowed starlight" without clear pattern-teaching. Template constructions appear ("She has learned to," "She has come here to") though momentum generally sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("nets lifted with the water like sleeping dragons remembering flight") but suffers from occasional density issues and repetitive constructions. Some philosophical passages edge toward purple prose ("the vast conspiracy of care"), though information density remains high with most sentences advancing both literal and thematic layers.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "a curve that wants another curve, a serif reaching for the serif it lost" but suffers from occasional overwriting. Mixed metaphors appear ("feathery strip," "excavate truth," "stitched from lies") and some template phrasing emerges ("She walked...She pocketed...She gathered"). Information density is generally high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though some descriptive passages could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("cobalt glass portico at the dome's entrance drank the lightning and glowed"). Strong verb choices throughout ("drank," "exhaled," "dissolved"). Minor weakness in the truncated ending and occasional abstraction ("variant allegiance to futures"), but no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"coat stitched from discarded playbills" establishes poverty, creativity, and resourcefulness simultaneously. Strong verb choices throughout: "lodged," "braided," "thread." Minor filter verb accumulation ("felt," "understood") in middle section prevents higher score, though rhythm variation supports scene pressure well.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some overwriting appears ("Colors of amber and bruised peach poured over the floes"). Repetition of "fleeting golden sunset" works as pattern but the phrase "logically emotional" twice feels mechanical rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.6)
    Exceptional sentence-level craft: "pillars breathing frost like caged dragons," "heartbeat under glass." Information density high—most sentences advance multiple layers. No loops or scaffolding detected. Rhythm varies naturally between long descriptive passages and short declarative moments.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("the flame caught with a sigh that sounded like a name"). Some overwrought figurative language ("entangling her memories," "sound and light swapping roles") and abstract phrasing ("fortified vulnerability") create occasional opacity. The paraphrase loop around "watchfully calm" and scattered filter verbs reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure. Multiple instances of purple prose ("needle of rain pricked his cheek," "tears salt-bright") and some redundancy in thematic statements. The "vibrant hush" repetition works as pattern but other repetitions feel mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density throughout, with lines doing multiple jobs ("Steam rose, twisting into the shape of a question mark"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("brassy island," "sour foam," "acid sea's sour foam" in opening). Template cadence appears briefly ("She traced...She spiraled...She banked") but serves accumulative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong moments of compression ("the silence that tasted of sensed absence") but hampered by repetitive structures ("she + verb" patterns), particularly in the middle section. The paraphrase loop around "forgotten songs" appears three times. Information density varies—some lines do multiple jobs while others merely transit.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "fear pulsing like a second heartbeat" showcase precision, but the prose suffers from density issues with figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats. Template constructions appear ("First she angled... Then she tilted...") and abstract phrases like "reconstitute the treaty... in living relation" lack concrete immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control and information density, with effective variation in sentence length and structure. Minor issues with abstract phrasing ("fold in patience" repeated without full clarification) and occasional register elevation ("chord progression, patient and repeating") that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information-dense prose with strong sensory specificity ("copper wind chimes sang a minor chord," "resinous memory") but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("understanding is not possession but permission" followed by similar abstraction). Template cadence appears in "He [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs though the closing sequences regain propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.2)
    Strong moments of sensory precision ("salt in the air brush their lashes," "bird-sized light casting moving syllables") but hampered by abstract phrasing ("testament kept strangely honest") and occasional opacity. Several sentences perform double duty effectively, but others drift into elevated diction without clear payoff ("preparing to surface whenever the desert needed freshly sharpened silence"). No major loops or scaffolding, but density sometimes obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery that advances atmosphere. Information density is high—most sentences do multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing around healing concepts ("collective healing spreading like ripples") and occasional elevated diction ("transmute," "transfigured") create minor friction with otherwise grounded imagery. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in figurative language ("blade of light," "shawl of cobwebs") and occasional abstraction ("weathered innocence"). No significant loops or scaffolding, though some phrases border on purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The fog responded, thickening into slow coils that followed the chalk line, and the televisions inside the sculpture began to hum in harmony." Some filter verb accumulation ("He remembered," "He felt") in the climactic section slightly dulls immediacy. Strong rhythm variation and vivid specificity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with strong imagery but hampered by abstract passages like "escape velocity is not speed but surrender" and some paraphrase loops around the ache/luminous concepts. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions though the lyric mode partially justifies the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Information density high—most lines do multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("radiant haven called Solace Ridge" feels forced) and one instance of elevated register drift ("decisive kindness that had guided her career crystallized").

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong figurative control ("sea of ink-dark clouds," "catching starlight like spilled mercury") without overwriting. Some filter verb clusters appear ("She saw herself," "Elara understood") but information density remains high. The incomplete final sentence is a critical flaw that undermines closure momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and evocative imagery ("milk-white and sharp as a star"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some figurative density in the transformation sequence borders on overwriting but remains legible. The incomplete final sentence creates purposeful openness.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in "Light unfurled—not harsh like fire, but soft as the zephyr bloom." Some minor density issues appear in expository passages ("legend claimed"), but the polishing sequence and final transformation show excellent momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("honeyed hush" both describes sound and recalls the confession's false sweetness). Some repetitive phrasing around "pattern left by drip of thawing icicles" (appears verbatim three times) and minor scaffold in "She understood then" and "She would wait here until." No loops touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments ("spiral seashell fragment, its ridges worn smooth by decades of turning") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She had come here," "She walked on," "She realized"). Information density is high in character encounters but some transitional passages feel scaffolded. The "lucidly watchful" repetition and occasional abstract phrasing ("shapes of different hopes") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and varied syntax, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("threads of light that drifted into sleeping houses, seeding dreams"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some template patterns emerge ("She drew...She followed...Finally") and the extended metaphors occasionally strain coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—"A flash-paper alchemist named Lira moved between the skeletal apple trees, her breath forming small, patient clouds that lingered longer than physics allowed" establishes character, setting, and magical realism simultaneously. The "demonstrating patience physically" repetition functions as taught pattern rather than loop. Minor figurative density in places but serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The marble cavern breathed cold light" establishes setting, atmosphere, and the animate/inanimate tension central to the theme. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm without template patterns, and the prose avoids loops or scaffolding. Minor friction in phrases like "reverse-engineer wonder" which slightly over-abstracts compared to the otherwise concrete imagery, and "peripherally focused" appears three times when variation might strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs (memory as mass "pressing against her collarbones like wet wool"). Some figurative density in peak moments borders on overwriting ("frost feathers," "whalebone reverie," "bronze grotto" in close succession), and "boundary-lessly" reads as forced compound.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "each hollow a lesson harvested from the nights she woke reaching." Minor template cadence in middle section ("She breathed...She pressed...She worked") and slight overwriting in figurative density reduce perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("clouds drifting backward as if rewinding a film") but suffers from abstract patches and some repetitive phrasing around ghosts/negotiations. The incomplete final sentence appears to be a technical error. Information density is generally good but some passages lean abstract rather than embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though occasional overwriting appears ("small astonishments," "quiet engine of stoic wonder"). Some abstract phrasing ("equations for hope," "vectors...into equations") creates mild opacity but doesn't obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but repetitive phrasing appears ("excruciatingly gentle" used 4 times, "glacial hush" 4 times, "petrichor nostalgia" 3 times). Template cadence in middle section ("He had come to... He had abandoned it... He pressed his forehead..."). The abrupt ending mars line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong sentence-level craft with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("the pocket sundial warm in her palm" establishes object, temperature, possession). Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval," "hindsight clarity") and one instance of elevated register drift, though these don't touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty—"snowflakes drift through the fog, resting on Hara's lashes like tiny white moths"—but suffers from occasional overwriting ("salt-laced fog swallowing the harbor until the world felt underwater") and abstract phrasing. Some redundancy in describing the weavers' patience and rope's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"She had spent years writing obituaries for the living, practicing the geography of healing." Some mild repetition of "absence" and "presence" serves the accumulative pattern. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and strategic paragraph cuts that advance the ritual's stages.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("crystal spires anchored to three black stalactites that moaned"). Some elevated diction in peak beats ("embryonic star still burned," "reckless reds and blues") creates minor register drift. The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks, though "hypothesizing about everything" appears twice without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty - "each one holding a pocket of air that whistled when the wind passed through." Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("blessing them with the residue of old fires"). The incomplete final sentence and occasional elevated diction ("harmonize with the wind") create minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong moments of propulsive imagery like "breadcrumb of light roll out—a tiny star no larger than a tear" create momentum, and the progression from fountain to fountain maintains forward drive. However, the phrase "defiant hush" appears three times without meaningful variation, and some constructions feel slightly overwrought ("the slow wheeling of galaxies"). The prose generally serves the accumulative structure well with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, though the final sentence appears truncated ("until every trapped memory tasted").

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with effective variation in sentence length and structure, though some abstract phrasing ("troubling serenity" appears multiple times) and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density. The piece maintains momentum through accumulative imagery, but phrases like "approximating infinity" and some conceptual abstractions reduce immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has moments of beauty but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears too frequently in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in the repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. The phrase "thundering calm" repeats four times, creating unnecessary echo.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity: "the great brass bob hung weightless between past and future." Some overwriting in figurative density ("bruised sky," "bronze ribs") and occasional register elevation ("incremental absolution measured in heartbeats"). The incomplete final sentence creates effective suspension but reads as artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("velveteen gloom" used three times, "tenderly organized" twice). Some metaphors strain ("tapestry records every intention ever buried") but momentum sustains through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"breath fogging in the pre-dawn cold that clung to the frozen lake like a secret." Some template cadence appears mid-story ("She understood then," "She realized," "She thought of") and "groundedly imaginative" reads as prompt-speak, though the closure image remains untouched by artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The paper was brittle, the ink fading" establishes both physical decay and temporal distance. Some figurative density in peak beats ("submarine light," "thistled calm") but pattern-taught and purposeful. Minor deduction for the incomplete final sentence and occasional abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("ashy petals," "dark pearls") but suffers from density overload—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching (-0.5 applied). Template cadence appears in "She felt...She reached up...She lifted" structure. Abstract phrases like "lucid grief" and "somber marvel muted the scene" create opacity in peak beats rather than concrete propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with selective density - "Each tooth was a syllable in a language no one spoke anymore" does multiple jobs. Some repetitive structures appear ("Layer one...Layer two...Layer three") but serve accumulative pattern. Minor scaffold in transitions ("I descended again," "Then I began to dig") costs momentum. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. Deductions for overwriting in places ("velvet library," "amber light pooled like honey" in opening), some abstract passages that could be more concrete, and occasional metaphor density that obscures rather than clarifies ("vanishing arts fraying like silk").

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, and the rhythm varies naturally between longer descriptive passages and shorter declarative moments. Some figurative density in peak beats ("fracturing into colors no glass had ever bent") occasionally tips toward overwriting. The truncated ending "Mar" appears to be a technical error rather than intentional effect.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong imagistic density but suffers from repetitive structural patterns ("She [verb]ed" dominates multiple paragraphs) and occasional overwriting ("condensed lightning and memory"). Information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, though some metaphorical reaches strain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "brass key lay beneath a flowerpot, displaced from any lock." Some elevated diction ("creeping normality noticer," "inadvertently profound") creates mild register friction. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "shard of hush" that accumulates meaning rather than loops.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. However, several abstract constructions reduce immediacy: "animate lifeless becoming simply alive," "certainty cracked harder than marble." Some repetitive phrasing around "revelation cascades" and overuse of colons for definition. The prose occasionally tells what could be shown through image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("each step the same cold marble") but some abstraction loops ("perpetual motion" concept repeated without variation) and occasional academic drift that dulls momentum. The mathematical language sometimes creates density without advancing action. No major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but "methodically hopeful" appears three times unchanged, creating a template feel. Some figurative density in peak moments ("moon reached its zenith; the bristles of the brush began to sing") doesn't quite land, though the overall texture supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("waterfall once sang in twelve keys," "dialects clashing like cracked bells"). Some instances of elevated diction that occasionally strain ("fierce as yeast," "ossifies") and minor repetition of "displaced persons" without variation. The final unfinished sentence creates purposeful suspension.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("glistening hieroglyphs across the jagged causeway"). Some overwriting in figurative density: "Moon gone, horizon bleeding violet" and "helmet of cloud" cluster ornamentally. Template cadence appears briefly ("Step one...Step two"). Information density high in most passages, momentum maintained despite occasional purple moments.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Some overwriting in figurative density ("breathed like a lung after resuscitation," "lingering luminance," "bruise colors") that accumulates without always advancing pressure. No major loops or scaffolding, but occasional elevated diction borders on purple.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control throughout. Minor metaphor density in places ("restless euphony in vapor form") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean grammar and purposeful paragraph structure support momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.7)
    Exemplary prose density—nearly every sentence advances multiple story elements simultaneously. "The city trembled. Cracks raced across the shell, knitting and splitting in fractal urgency" demonstrates perfect synthesis of action and imagery. Information flows cleanly without loops or scaffolding. The controlled sentence variety maintains propulsion throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with selective density: "Its sliding door was jammed half open, a mouth of iron teeth." Information density is high without padding. However, some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("steady resolve," "moral erosion"), and occasional template structures appear ("She began to draw...," "She arranged...," "Then she noticed...").

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"Years of mapping eroding coasts had taught her to read negative space" establishes backstory, expertise, and thematic lens simultaneously. Some figurative density borders on excess ("like ivy through a ribcage," "like scattered commas," "like bruises") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor repetitive structures appear ("She had found," "She imagined," "She pictured") but function as ceremonial patterning rather than template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments: "the lantern flame elongated, as though the stamp drew light the way tide draws moon." Some density issues with stacked modifiers: "tranquilly perceptive of how the dappled resolve on the walls..." Information density high but occasionally tips toward overwriting. No major loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with most lines serving multiple purposes, particularly in the ritual sequences where action, emotion, and transformation interweave. Minor issues include occasional abstract phrasing ("folded letters, a child's wooden bird" could be more specific) and one instance of therapy-speak that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "She was no longer a survivor; she was a perturbation." However, "intangibly tangible" appears three times without evolving meaning, and "bleak exhilaration" repeats as a label. Some abstract constructions ("unused potential," "negative space of her own aborted timeline") could be more concretely embodied. These repetitions prevent higher scoring despite strong syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases ("shadows pooled like ink"). Several instances of abstract/elevated language that reduces immediacy ("the frequency steadied into silence"). Some template cadence in middle sections ("She realized... She understood..."). The oxymoron "brilliant dimness" works but becomes slightly repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm, but some overwriting appears ("the sieved hush deepened, a hush that was not absence of sound but absence of absolution"). The incomplete final sentence and occasional density of figurative language in high-pressure moments prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths that breathe with scene pressure, from the opening's atmospheric establishment to the taut simplicity of "The cords snapped with a sound like a sigh." Information density is high throughout, with lines doing multiple jobs (the moon as "filed coin" establishes both time and the theme of worn-down edges), though phrases like "furrowed hush" and "uncommonly thoughtful" occasionally strain for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments (bioluminescence igniting with each stroke, compass needle "jerking like a compass rose having second thoughts") but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("merrily melancholic" appears three times). Some metaphors strain (tide as "magnet made of guilt"). Information density is generally high, though the final third contains some redundant emotional processing that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density high with most lines carrying multiple functions. However, several metaphor vehicles strain coherence ("baseball warmed, reacting to the ink like a compass needle" mixes temperature/magnetism awkwardly). Some paraphrase loops appear ("measured not in miles but in margins" restates without adding). The prose occasionally prioritizes lyricism over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose suffers from density issues with figurative language in nearly every sentence without clear pattern-teaching ("ribbons of gold and indigo, threading through moonlit blossoms until the air itself became a loom"). Several mixed metaphors blur clarity. Information density is high but momentum drags through overwriting, particularly in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The cards whispered as she shuffled, their onyx ink shifting to show scenes that had not yet happened." Strong syntactic variety and rhythmic control. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("choking beauty" appears twice) and slight metaphor density in places, though it serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density high—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("everything denied," "long reckoning") and one instance of telling what's shown ("Lin understood"). The filter verb "felt" appears multiple times but serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("stars themselves had melted and dripped down the slopes") but suffers from occasional overwriting in figurative density and some template repetition ("She had once believed," "She did not know"). Information density is high but momentum occasionally stalls in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some figurative language feels slightly overwrought ("constellation of rebellion," "syllable in a sentence too long suppressed") but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with most lines serving multiple functions—"pockets full of painted rocks" establishes character habit, magical system, and obsessive preparation simultaneously. Some figurative language borders on overwrought ("heavier than memory yet lighter than breath"), and template cadence appears briefly ("I kneel...I see...I steady"). The prose achieves genuine beauty in places like "the eels remember my name" without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly "The darkroom timer, salvaged from a forgotten press, ticked furiously tranquil." Some abstract phrasing ("cartography of scars," "vigil in pause") occasionally slows momentum. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("gnomon cast a crooked shadow"). However, several instances of overwriting detract: "fractured through the vaulted ceiling, scattering dignified chaos" feels strained, as does "questions trailing behind like wedding veils." The metaphor density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in philosophical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("paper birds that caught the wind") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most high-pressure beats without always advancing pressure. Some paraphrase loops ("luminous fracture" appears twice with similar meaning). The abrupt cutoff damages momentum, though the accumulative design partially compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. However, some figurative language feels overwrought ("blade of indigo ready to fall"), and there are instances of abstract phrasing that slow momentum ("refuge stitched from forgotten light"). The template phrase "he [verb]" appears too frequently in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "petals were beginning to forget their lines" merges literal and metaphorical. Some figurative density in peak beats ("raindrops the size of lullabies") but pattern-taught early and pays off. The truncated final word "oss" appears to be a typo rather than intentional, creating a jarring end-note.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("ghost ship's compass rested beside the lace, silver case stippled with greenish verdigris"). However, some figurative density in peak moments ("plankton of mist," "crepuscular, quietly true") occasionally obscures clarity, and phrases like "rhythmically placid" appear three times.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A minor deduction for a very slight scaffold in "She had come here not for botany, but for the butterfly house," which states a motive that is immediately and more effectively shown thereafter.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density (e.g., "frost feathers that feathered north"). Minor figurative stacking in peak beats ("trapped starlight," "drifting resonance") slightly mutes clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains clarity and propulsion, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., breath fogging the lens reveals the "hidden lattice of light"). A minor figurative density appears in the climax ("liquid light, pooling in the cracked bowl of her chest") but is pattern-taught and serves closure. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; rhythm is masterfully controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts: slight over-reliance on figurative language in peak beats ("skin flaking into light") and one paraphrase loop ("disintegrate" / "dissolving"). Closure remains clear, but these dull the final image's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("patient as stone"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor rhythm slack in mid-paragraph ("She moved carefully..."). Peak beats maintain clarity without register drift. Sentence openings vary effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is masterfully dense and lyrical, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a slight over-reliance on metaphor in the middle section ("each tree a mast," "collecting absences the way a shell gathers absence of sea") creates a minor momentum drag, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor risk of overwriting in peak beats ("luminous disbelief of ordinary dawn") is mitigated because the pattern is taught and the closure remains clear. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and vivid, purposeful metaphors ("each drip from the ceiling a small bell"). Sentence rhythm varies naturally to support emotional beats. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final line is a strong, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Figurative language is consistent, voice-motivated, and rarely muddled ("like exhausted acrobats" is slightly weak but early). There is minimal scaffolding or looped phrasing. A single minor deduction for the "exhausted acrobats" cliché, but the overall propulsion and clarity, especially in peak beats, are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet precise with strong rhythmic control; figurative language consistently serves the theme. Minor overwriting in phrases like "marbled hush—thick, veined, almost sculptural" creates slight density but doesn't obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is remarkably composed with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional dense phrasing ("amalgamate" appears slightly abrupt). No loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("a melody of regret and recursion").

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.8)
    Prose is exceptional, with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with scene needs. Figurative language is coherent, purposeful, and pattern-taught, enhancing clarity and closure rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for occasional dense figurative language that slightly obscures immediacy in high-pressure beats (e.g., "shredding the hush into urgent flurries"). However, clarity is never fully lost, and the closure image remains sharp and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with sentences advancing multiple layers (e.g., "droplets slid off, carrying flecks of gold leaf that glittered like suspended stars"). Figurative language is pattern-taught and cohesive, though minor density in peak beats ("wordless conversation began between her pulse and the faint creak") slightly obscures immediacy. No loops or scaffolding; closure image remains clear and charged. Rhythm modulates effectively with scene tension.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with high information density. Minor figurative muddle in "auroral sorrow" appearing twice slightly dulls the pattern, and "fever breaks" is somewhat ornamental. Rhythm and sentence-level propulsion are masterful, and closure clarity is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight risk of figurative density in the peak beat ("dense as lead, hot as grief") which, while effective, borders on stacking modifiers. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless and supports closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and purposeful, vivid imagery. A minor deduction for a potential instance of overwriting ("cities bloom and wither inside dewdrops caught on fern fronds that were also his own eyelashes") which, while beautiful, slightly risks clarity in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, propulsion and clarity are superb.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deduct for a slight density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "strings shimmered, softly adaptive"), though it remains coherent and voice-motivated. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts that obscure cause and effect or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level craft accelerates with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud test passes seamlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("the old blues resolve into a major chord"). No loops, scaffold, or artifacts were detected. The final line achieves a powerful lyrical cadence that deepens the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.3)
    High information density with minimal scaffolding; figurative language like "time pooled into itself" serves pattern and payoff. Minor density in peak beats prevents perfect score, but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("exhaustion finally touching her like a gentle downbeat") slightly obscures clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.5)

    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and legible, serving character and atmosphere (e.g., "the cavern breathed resin and cedar"). No loops, scaffold, or artifactual phrasing. Minor deduction for a potentially mixed metaphor in "filament of hush" rising "like smoke," though it feels intentional and voice-motivated. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic variation and information density. Minor overwriting occurs in a few peak beats (e.g., "like a seed swallowing dusk" slightly strains the metaphor). However, clarity and propulsion are maintained, and no loops or scaffolding artifacts obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor figurative density occurs in the climax ("burst outward like a silent bell"), slightly blurring sense in a peak beat, preventing a perfect score. Otherwise, the writing is masterful, propulsive, and free of loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a potential register drift in "ethically playful," which feels slightly diagnostic for the POV, and a complex metaphor ("sky open like a blue eye") that is slightly less sharp than the surrounding concrete imagery. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the accumulative design. There are no loops, scaffold, or muddle in peak beats to obscure the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though some figurative language in peak beats ("like a tongue tasting a lie") slightly strains coherence. Rhythm is controlled and varies with emotional pressure. No loops, scaffold, or template cadence. Minor deduction for a single mixed metaphor that does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and rhythmic, with varied syntax and purposeful figurative language. Minor density in phrases like "star-drunk breeze" and "constellations and shipping lanes braided" slightly risks ornamentation but does not obscure closure.

    Prose is lush yet purposeful; images do multiple jobs and avoid muddle. Refrains like “the scent of hope” are patterned rather than redundant. Minor risk of density, but clarity holds at peak beats and the final image is crisp. Sentence rhythm varies and momentum never stalls.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with vivid metaphors that mostly cohere; a few flourish‑heavy lines flirt with purple but don’t obscure action. Minimal scaffolding or loops; sentences propel scene and image. Mechanics are clean. The abrupt cutoff in the last line harms closure music and costs a bit of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.9)
    Line‑level craft is vivid and economical—images like “too smooth” and “archived in real time” feel precise and earned. Occasional stacked metaphors approach lushness but stay coherent. The final sentence fragments (“a hidden”) introduce a visible artifact at the end, dulling the last cadence. Otherwise momentum and clarity are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line‑level craft is taut and musical; images align (glass/pearl/light) and avoid muddle. Sentences carry multiple jobs with minimal scaffold; repetition serves pattern rather than padding. A few lush turns verge on abundance but retain clarity. The final cadence is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line‑level craft is strong: images do double duty and syntax varies to maintain momentum. A few repeated constructions and jewel‑box metaphors flirt with excess but do not obscure causality. No paraphrase loops blunt the closure image; diction remains precise and purposeful. The restraint of the final lines lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense yet purposeful; images seldom feel redundant, and sentence rhythms vary to maintain momentum. Metaphoric texture is coherent (pages, ink, current, hush) with minimal mixing.

    Line-level craft is elegant and propulsive with high information density and clean syntax. A minor stumble occurs in the final line (“whisper” appears truncated), slightly dulling the last cadence. Figurative density is high but coherent and purposeful. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is vivid and efficient; most sentences carry dual loads of image and function. While metaphor density is high, vehicles cohere (navigation, flows, geometry, music), avoiding mixed imagery. Minimal scaffold or loops; cadence varies with scene needs. Minor risk of purple overreach is contained by consistent system imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is often beautiful and information‑dense, with strong image economy, but leans toward overwriting in clusters (“excruciatingly gentle” repeats; stacked metaphors risk saturation). The final line is truncated, dulling the closure image on the page. Despite lushness, sequential clarity holds and most lines do double duty. A light trim would heighten propulsion and preserve cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is dense yet clean; images pull multiple duties (sundial as tool, symbol, and mechanism). Figurative language is inventive without muddling sense; momentum rarely stalls.

No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry high information density with purposeful figurative alignment (obsidian mirrors, storm glass). The lyric texture rarely tips into purple, and momentum is preserved through action-threaded description. Minor risk of abstraction in one thematic sentence and the clipped final word, but clarity holds. No loops or scaffolding bog the beat work.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density with purposeful imagery; lines often do double duty (world + theme). Repetition (defiant hush, breadcrumbs) reads patterned, not looped. Minor risk of purple is kept in check by clarity of action and clean sequencing. The final cadence is sharp and unfussy, with no scaffold clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lush prose largely earns its density with precise, layered images; momentum stays intact. Repetition (“approximating infinity”) is purposeful and reweighted. However, the last sentence truncates (“the light”), a line-level artifact that blurs the ultimate image and costs musical closure. This prevents top-band polish.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lines do multiple jobs—imagery, action, and theme—without slipping into muddle; metaphors are coherent to the greenhouse/butterfly lexicon. Rhythm varies and avoids scaffold or synonym loops, and the prose carries momentum through the montage. A few elevated phrases verge on declarative theme, but they are balanced by tactile specifics (mica flecks, grooves catching rain). Copy is clean and the final cadence is precise.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Line-level craft is vivid and efficient, with strong images (“sea-smoke hissed,” “names, dates, confessions”) and purposeful metaphors tied to clocks and tide. Density remains mostly coherent, avoiding muddle. The truncated last sentence is a significant proofreading/cadence error at the closure beat, and a few phrases risk purple repetition (“grain by grain”). These issues curb otherwise excellent prose.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry high information density with few redundancies; images do multiple jobs (coin as history, mechanism, and intention). Lushness stops short of purple even in peak beats; repeated phrases (“tenderly organized,” “velveteen gloom”) are purposeful refrains. Mechanics are clean, with varied syntax and momentum aligned to scene turns. No figurative muddle touches the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density with clean syntax and varied rhythm; images are fresh and largely non‑redundant (“roots teach soil,” “mountain remembered fire”). Figurative language is frequent but purposeful; it rarely clots or contradicts physical logic. Minimal scaffold and no pattern‑artifacts; the prose carries momentum through scene rather than summary. A couple of abstract phrases could be trimmed without harm.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line‑level craft is tight: images do double duty (dust as medium and memory), and sentences vary in length and rhythm. Figurative density is high but coherent, with minimal scaffolding or loops. The prose propels rather than stalls, and the final image lands clean. One or two ornate metaphors could be trimmed without loss, but they don’t blur causality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line‑level craft is rich and purposeful; images do more than one job and propel mood and meaning. Some metaphor density risks saturation, and one or two conceptual sentences read like scaffolding. Overall clarity and cadence remain high, and the final image is clean and potent. No loops or syntactic monotony materially impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    Line‑level craft is strong: dense yet clear images doing multiple jobs, minimal scaffolding, varied rhythm. Metaphors (“grid nailed over coral”) are coherent and character‑specific. Minor issue: the final truncated line is a text artifact that blunts the landing and precludes higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is polished: high information density, purposeful motifs, and clean syntax. Lushness stays coherent; metaphors align (hollow as ear, birds lifting, rust falling).

Minor risk of on-the-nose phrasing near the end, but momentum holds. Syntax and paragraphing modulate well through discovery and resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.7)
    Line-level craft is strong—many sentences do double duty and figurative choices generally cohere—but density flirts with overrichness at times. The concluding “El” truncation is a proofreading error in the final beat, dulling cadence. Minor redundancy in metaphor families (absence as letters, punctuation, reliquary) risks saturation. Overall momentum holds despite the lushness.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line‑level craft is polished: strong verbs, layered images doing double duty, and minimal scaffolding. A few phrases flirt with purple density, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially through the vault sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.6)
    Many lines do double duty with crisp, evocative images tied to action (twilight soldering, letters as cast type). Figurative density is high but largely coherent and voice-driven rather than purple. However, the final sentence is truncated (“the next shard of the”), a material artifact in the last beat that dulls the closing image and precludes top-band scores. Otherwise, momentum and clarity hold.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    High information density with clean propulsion; images often do double duty (driftwood both setting and epistolary metaphor). Figurative language stays coherent and scene‑bound; no paraphrase loops or template cadence. A few elevated phrases (“sieved hush”) recur meaningfully rather than as ornament. The final image is crisp and unblurred by purple overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, clean syntax, and evocative figurative language that serves character. Sentences are constructed with a deliberate rhythm that mirrors the story's meditative pace. There are no wasted words, prose artifacts, or overwritten passages; every line works to advance the story's intellectual and emotional aims.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is consistently luminous and precise, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, almost always serving to deepen character or atmosphere, such as the river's sound like "distant applause." While the density of poetic descriptions borders on overwriting in a few places (e.g., "frost feathers that feathered"), it remains coherent with the established artistic voice and never obscures the narrative's clean, propulsive momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language like "shards of frozen dolphinsong" and "heat-caterpillars of emotion" is consistently inventive. However, the sheer density of metaphor occasionally verges on overwhelming, a hairline fracture where the brilliance risks becoming overwrought. A phrase like "noon moonlight" is wonderfully evocative but strains logic just enough to momentarily break immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. Phrasing like "cradled in his arms like a cracked halo" and "books floated like jellyfish" is specific and memorable. The rhythm is controlled, slowing and accelerating with the action. There are a few instances of familiar phrasing ("tide whispered secrets") that are functional but lack the sharp originality of the story's best lines, preventing a perfect score, but these are minor issues in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by its precision, rhythm, and high information density. Figurative language is potent and original ("the sound folded itself into the night like a secret handshake"; "Trust was the real cargo"). The final, deliberately incomplete sentence is a bold and effective choice, forcing the reader to participate in the act of imagining the future.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous, elegant, and rhythmically controlled. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high, with nearly every sentence containing a metaphor or simile. While the images are individually striking ("narcotic breaths," "grief had calcified"), their sheer volume occasionally risks becoming overwriting, slightly impeding momentum by calling attention to the language itself rather than the experience. The craft is high, but a touch more restraint in the descriptive density would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is luminous and dense with high-impact figurative language. While the sheer density of metaphor occasionally verges on overwhelming (e.g., "golden logarithms"), it overwhelmingly succeeds, creating a potent, dreamlike atmosphere. Sentences are crafted with precision and rhythmic control, propelling the narrative forward through what could have been a static conceptual exercise.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, propulsive, and demonstrates high information density.

There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line serves to advance plot, character, or atmosphere with startling efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and highly crafted, yet it never sacrifices clarity or momentum. Figurative language is not an adornment but the fundamental engine of the story's logic and feeling. Sentences are constructed with high information density, where every image serves character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. The piece is free of redundancies or scaffolding, demonstrating exceptional line-level precision and control.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is both lush and precise, with a high density of vivid, original imagery ("laughter scattering like sparks," "scent like cold coins"). Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the narrative momentum effortlessly. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no verbal clutter, loops, or mixed metaphors to dilute its powerful effect.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with vivid imagery that rarely feels excessive. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward with a contemplative momentum that matches the story's tone. The only minor flaw is a slight drift into more abstract, summary-like language in the final paragraph, which slightly diminishes the impact of the concrete imagery that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("shelves leaning like exhausted acrobats"). However, the high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, and some phrases lean toward cliché ("heart hammering against ribs," "tears shining like broken glass"). The sentence-level propulsion is generally strong, but a few moments of overwritten texture slightly impede momentum without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is a high-wire act of figurative density, sustained with remarkable control and precision. Sentences are information-rich, advancing atmosphere and action simultaneously without a single wasted word or lazy construction. While the descriptive richness ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") borders on excessive, it never collapses into a figurative muddle and successfully creates a unique, mesmerizing textual surface.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Imagery is vivid and purposeful, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. The piece avoids major artifacts, but a few phrases like "The mundane mysticism of it settled like snow" feel slightly overwritten. Additionally, some of the thematic summary lines function as a form of scaffolding that could have been trimmed to let the images do their work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with a deliberate, rhythmic cadence that supports the story's atmosphere. While the figurative language is pervasive, it rarely becomes overwrought, instead building a cohesive symbolic landscape. A minor weakness is a tendency toward abstract authorial statements filtered through the character, such as "honesty sometimes hurts precisely because it adds nothing," which feels more like a thematic thesis than an in-the-moment perception.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both precision and lyricism. Information density is high, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs to advance character, atmosphere, and plot. Figurative language is fresh and thematically coherent, such as the dew like "hesitant stars" or the marbles like "tiny flawed moons." There are no loops, redundancies, or overwritten passages; the rhythm is controlled and the word choice is immaculate, resulting in a piece that feels both effortless and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with high information density and a strong, consistent rhythm. Phrases like "Möbius corridor" and "thawed frost" are memorable and precise. A few moments lean slightly into overwriting (e.g., "shredding the hush into urgent flurries"), and a line like "Proof gathered in the data streaming..." feels a little too direct, representing minor blemishes on an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense with evocative, precise imagery and strong verbs, creating a rich texture that drives the story's momentum. While highly figurative, the language rarely feels overwritten, instead serving to build the specific, surreal atmosphere. The sentence structure is varied, and there are no discernible scaffold phrases or loops, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest literary quality—immaculate, evocative, and rhythmically masterful. Figurative language is consistently original and purposeful, as in "steam rising like doubts too light to confess" or "truth...orbits the gut like a cold moon." There is zero scaffolding or redundancy; every sentence carries weight and advances the story's atmospheric and emotional progression. The information density is superb, creating a rich, immersive experience without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. Sentences like "The second insisted the wheel was a throat through which factories coughed up the souls of workers who never clocked out" are both poetic and functional. The prose is free of loops or scaffolding, with a varied rhythm that supports the building tension and quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with a high degree of figurative language that consistently lands with precision and beauty. While verging on overwriting, it never crosses the line into obscurity; instead, each sentence works to build the story's rich, immersive texture. The rhythm is masterful, and the piece is free of redundancies or scaffolding, demonstrating superior line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains moments of startling beauty, such as a melody sounding "like a dog’s name spoken backward into hope." However, it suffers from two notable flaws. The phrase "softly adaptive" is repeated three times, becoming a distracting authorial tic. More critically, the story ends on an incomplete sentence fragment, a jarring craft error that completely breaks the narrative frame and undermines the polish of the entire piece, making it unpublishable as is.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely beautiful, with strong imagery and varied syntax. Momentum is well-maintained. A recurring prose artifact, the verbatim repetition of the phrase "sensitively perceptive" three times, slightly dulls the craft, reading more like a label than an organically expressed trait. While a minor flaw, it prevents the line-level execution from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and evocative imagery without a single wasted word. Sentences like "Lin's life had grown stale in the same twelve-bar blues of fog, gull cries, and rotating beam" establish character, setting, and motivation simultaneously. The story is free of loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and polished piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly inventive, with figurative language that consistently deepens the story's concepts. However, the slightly mechanical repetition of the phrase "decorates with silence" stands out as a minor artifact in an otherwise seamless text. While the line-level craft is exceptional, this small loop prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious and highly figurative, yet it maintains clarity and momentum, a difficult balance to strike. Each sentence is dense with information and atmosphere without feeling overwritten, as the rich language serves the story's magical-realist logic. The rhythm varies effectively, moving from contemplative description to the propulsive listing of memories as the climax approaches, demonstrating excellent syntactic control under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished, with striking and consistent figurative language that builds a coherent atmosphere. Sentences are crafted for maximum impact, driving momentum while layering meaning ("a sound like glass breaking in reverse"). While the density of metaphor is very high, it serves the story's surreal, dreamlike logic without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, with extraordinary information density and rhythmic precision. Figurative language is not decorative but foundational to the story's logic and worldview ("a filament of hush rose like smoke"). The piece is entirely free of scaffolding or verbal clutter, demonstrating meticulous line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is ambitious, beautiful, and demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and syntax. Information density is high, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. The only minor flaw is an occasional tendency toward overwriting where the figurative language becomes so dense it momentarily risks obscuring meaning (e.g., "stray droplets no microscope loved"). This is a hairline slip in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, memorable phrases ("pressed grief between sheets of time," "a silent bell"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's contemplative momentum. While the figurative language is generally a strength, it occasionally becomes so dense that it risks feeling overwritten. The final, incomplete sentence ("and those who breathe") is an ambiguous stylistic choice that slightly muddles the otherwise crystalline closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with very few wasted words. The line-level craft is nearly flawless, propelling the narrative through rich imagery and precise language. A single sentence near the end—"the texture of time was... the rough warmth of human hands"—borders on an overly direct thematic statement, a minor imperfection in an otherwise superb piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is luminous and dense with precise, evocative imagery. The high density of figurative language is controlled, creating texture rather than noise. A minor flaw appears in the final paragraphs, where the language shifts from the concrete and sensory to the abstract and declarative, momentarily trading scene for summary, which slightly softens the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with vivid, purposeful imagery and high information density. The prose is lyrical and precise. The score is slightly tempered by minor prose artifacts—the repetition of key phrases like "as the transformation completes" and "insight fuses with empathy" creates a conceptual loop that momentarily dulls the propulsion of an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with a strong rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is often effective, such as the library ceiling becoming a chart. The craft is slightly marred by occasional slips into sentimental cliché ("tears salted her lips like sea spray"), which momentarily disrupt the otherwise sophisticated and controlled line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and evocative figurative language that rarely feels overwritten. Sentences are rhythmically varied, and word choice is precise and surprising ("frost caught mid-breath," "mica stars"). There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding. The clarity of the prose allows the complex, fantastical imagery to land without confusion, creating momentum through sheer beauty and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and exquisite figurative language that is both beautiful and functional. Sentences like "a translucent chord thrashed like a trapped moth, its wings the shape of unfinished music" perform multiple narrative tasks at once. The prose is entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, demonstrating a masterful command of rhythm and clarity that propels the story forward effortlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and startlingly original figurative language that is never ornamental. Phrases like "lantern trembling like a guilty thought" and "a decimal point of water" are both beautiful and precise. The prose is clean, propulsive, and entirely free of artifacts; every sentence serves to deepen character, atmosphere, and theme with remarkable economy.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("oxide skin flaking like rusted petals," "bled into the air like scent") is original and integral to the voice, not decorative. The piece is remarkably free of artifacts; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere. The writing is both precise and poetic, achieving a rare balance that elevates the entire story.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with a deliberate, rhythmic cadence that supports the story's accumulative power. Figurative language is not ornamental but fundamental to the narrative's logic, as seen in lines like "transformation was not a procedure but a weather pattern." While the density of metaphor is high, it remains coherent and purposeful, avoiding overwriting and successfully carrying the story's emotional and thematic weight without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with dense, evocative sentences that perform multiple functions. While the figurative language is consistently rich, it occasionally borders on being overworked in the opening, such as the gulls screaming "the way colors scream." However, this density is the story's core method and aligns with the Accumulative lens, creating the haggard, hyper-meaningful world Ishka inhabits. The craft is otherwise flawless, with no loops, scaffolding, or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense with inventive figurative language ("lullaby learning to bite," "audible auroras") and maintains a compelling rhythm throughout. While the high density of metaphor occasionally risks becoming overwrought, it never breaks clarity or momentum, instead contributing to the story's unique texture. The sentence-level craft is meticulous, with no discernible loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and crafted with immense care, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. The figurative language is consistently strong and evocative. However, the density of similes and metaphors is so high that it occasionally risks feeling overwrought, momentarily pulling focus from the narrative to the writing itself. A slight thinning of the figurative texture in key moments of action would have increased propulsion, but this is a minor issue in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense with evocative, precise imagery, yet remains clear and propulsive. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied and controlled, creating a poetic texture without sacrificing momentum. The piece is free of scaffolding or redundancy, and the intentionally incomplete final sentence is a bold and effective choice that resonates with the story's themes of new, unmapped beginnings.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is consistently elegant and precise, with high information density and a strong, musical rhythm. Figurative language is vivid and effective, such as the tower as a "tuning fork" and spouts like "brief new galaxies." The piece is almost flawless at the line level, with only the slightly repetitive use of a key phrase ("courageously kind") standing out as a minor tell in a story that otherwise shows with immense skill.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is largely exceptional, with a strong rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is often striking ("silence pressed like velvet," "smiled the way light smiles on water"). However, a few moments in high-pressure beats resort to slightly less original phrasing (e.g., the amulet fusing "with a sound like a sigh"), which momentarily lowers the otherwise stellar line-level execution and prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest literary quality—dense, lyrical, and precise. Figurative language is consistently striking and purposeful, such as "suspicion narrowing his eyes to paper cuts" and "dawn cracked the sky open, spilling pale ink across the city." There are no wasted words, loops, or clunky constructions; every sentence propels the narrative while deepening character and atmosphere with exceptional rhythm and control.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, varied syntax, and potent, specific imagery ("nib trimmed with microscopic maple leaves"). The prose is lush and risks being overwritten, yet its density feels purposeful and controlled, serving the story's focus on texture. A few phrases lean towards the familiar (e.g., silence "like glass"), but these are minor moments in an otherwise stunning execution.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, balancing high figurative density with clarity and momentum. Word choice is precise and evocative, and sentence structures vary to create a compelling rhythm. Despite the richness of the language, there is no overwriting; every metaphor and image serves to build the story's unique atmosphere and logic without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, characterized by dense, evocative imagery and a strong, controlled rhythm. Sentences are crafted to do multiple jobs, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. While the figurative language is consistently strong, a few moments rely on more familiar constructions ("struck her like a meteor"), a minor blemish on an otherwise impeccable surface.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, clear propulsion, and an absence of scaffolding or loops. Word choice is precise and evocative, with strong verbs and concrete nouns grounding the fantastical setting. Figurative language is fresh and effective ("corporate horns sounded, polite as funeral bells"), enhancing the atmosphere without ever feeling overwritten or obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, strong verbs, and evocative, original imagery ("petals unfurled like frostbitten silk," "a pale comma against the dark"). There is virtually no scaffolding or redundancy; every sentence contributes to momentum or atmosphere. A phrase like "even the wind had forgotten how to speak" borders on purple but, in context, serves the heightened tone of the pre-climax moment.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and highly efficient, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. Word choice is precise and evocative ("tiny glassy sighs," "thinner than rumor"), and the rhythm of the sentences modulates perfectly with the action. The piece is remarkably free of artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the repetition of "magnetic calm" functions as a successful motif rather than a redundant echo.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density in every sentence. Word choices are precise and evocative ("corrugated skin," "ghost delta," "black comma against the blank page"). The piece exhibits masterful rhythmic control, balancing rich description with forward momentum, and it passes a read-aloud test with flying colors. There are no loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, resulting in a polished, crystalline text.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic propulsion. Figurative language is rich and evocative ("shutters closed like eyelids after a long cry," "cracks closing like lips after a secret") but remains coherent and purposeful, enhancing the atmosphere without obscuring clarity. The prose is meticulously polished, free of loops or scaffolding, resulting in a clean and powerful reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with each sentence carrying weight. Figurative language is rich and purposeful, as in "Coral retreated like a closing fist." The line-level craft is impeccable, with varied syntax and a strong, rhythmic cadence that supports the story's melancholic and awe-filled tone. There are no wasted words or momentum-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.5)

The piece avoids overwriting by ensuring its figurative language is thematically coherent and serves the story's mythic atmosphere. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; it is an exceptionally clean and polished piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong imagery. Minor but noticeable artifacts detract from its polish, including the clunky repetition of a key phrase and moments of scaffolding where one sentence explains the figurative language of the preceding one ("These awakenings were memories..."). These loops slightly dampen the otherwise propulsive momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density where every figurative line also serves to advance the magical-realist plot. The language is elevated without becoming obscure, and the syntax is varied and propulsive. There are no loops or scaffolding; the line-level work is clean, precise, and carries the weight of the story's mythic ambition without a single misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant, with high information density and striking figurative language. The rhythm is controlled, and the word choice is precise and evocative. The piece avoids major artifacts, but the sheer density of its metaphors and similes occasionally borders on overwriting, creating a uniformly elevated texture that could have benefited from moments of greater simplicity to heighten contrast. A minor repetition of the phrase "interrupting journeys" is the only other slight blemish on an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a density of figurative language that can feel self-conscious. Lines like the violinist's music being "futuristic nostalgia in audible form" function as thematic labels that slightly undermine the showing. This tendency to narrate its own symbolism is a hairline flaw that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, striking figurative language, and a controlled, elegant rhythm. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. Phrasing like "leaves scraping the dome like dry wings" is both evocative and economical, demonstrating complete command of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise, sensory imagery. However, the repetition of key phrases like "fierce tenderness" and "the moment before deciding," while thematically functional as a motif, slightly dulls the otherwise sharp edge of the language. This minor redundancy is the only element holding the craft back from true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and demonstrates exceptional control at the line level. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful ("bodies keep archives of every explosion"). The piece avoids almost all scaffolding or redundancy. A minor deduction is for a single phrase, "lotus-hearted ache," which feels slightly overwrought and momentarily drifts into a register that is more poetic than the established narrative voice, a hairline fissure in an otherwise flawless surface.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is both elegant and efficient, demonstrating high information density where each line serves character, atmosphere, or action. Figurative language is not ornamental but integral to the story's logic and world-building ("canvas drank the light," "laughter held in cupped hands"). The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other prose artifacts, resulting in clean, forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, clear, and rhythmically sophisticated. Figurative language is consistently inventive and precise (e.g., "certainty peel away like old varnish," "the grin became another doorway"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold; every sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere and meaning with exceptional grace.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. The figurative language is inventive and supports the story's core conceit. A minor but noticeable flaw is the repetition of the phrase "candidly cryptic," which appears in two separate beats. In a piece this polished, the echo stands out and slightly mars an otherwise immaculate execution.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating high information density and sentence-level propulsion. Figurative language is not ornamental but the fundamental logic of the story, with each metaphor building upon the last to create a coherent symbolic ecosystem. The writing is free of loops, scaffolding, or cliché. The line "Pain had been photosynthesized; grief had become the pigment of new constellations" is a testament to the author's control, achieving a perfect, luminous clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exquisite, marked by high information density, rhythmic variation, and startlingly original figurative language ("moonlight pooled like spilled milk," "moth with singed wings"). The prose is lush and consistently verges on the poetic, but it maintains clarity and propulsion, especially during the crucial repair sequence. While the density of imagery is immense, it rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story's unique, dreamlike texture without obscuring the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it sometimes relies on a high density of figurative language that verges on abstraction, such as "cautious exuberance made visible." The final paragraph slips into summary, explaining the archive's new state rather than letting the final image of the citizens learning Aelvaric carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and dense, a significant strength overall. However, two minor recurring artifacts slightly mar the finish. The word "dappled" is used to describe resolve twice in close succession, creating a noticeable echo. The phrase "slyly heartfelt," while a required element, feels slightly forced in its second appearance describing Lira's smile, creating a small moment of authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language, such as the skylight making the attic "both cathedral and grave," is consistently fresh and purposeful. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and atmospheric weight, resulting in a piece that is both elegant and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically rich, with high information density in the opening paragraphs. However, the final act suffers from a shift from showing to telling. Sentences like "Iona understood then..." and "The grain told of..." are summary scaffolds that explain the resolution rather than dramatizing it. While the line-level craft is strong throughout, this structural weakness at the climax prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking, original imagery. However, the story suffers from a significant prose artifact: the phrase "softly ingenious" is repeated three times, including in the final line, functioning as a repetitive scaffold that dulls the impact. This loop is the primary flaw in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its imagery. However, the recurring phrase "cheerful gloom," while effective, is used five times, bordering on a tic. More significantly, the final paragraph contains some conceptual redundancy and summarizing statements that soften the momentum built by the climax, slightly reducing the impact of an otherwise pristine piece.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, lyrical, and precise, with zero wasted words or overwriting. The sentence-level craft is exceptional, creating a propulsive rhythm that mirrors the careful unfolding of Finch’s plan. Phrases like "reflections on wet marble," "captive fireflies," and "a footprint of ordered randomness" are both beautiful and functionally perfect. The language is the story's greatest strength, achieving a rare synthesis of elegance and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, a high-risk strategy that succeeds due to its control and consistency. The rhythm is varied, sentences are propulsive, and there are no loops or redundancies. While the metaphoric density is exceptionally high, it is the story's taught-in mode of communication and remains coherent, rarely if ever obscuring meaning. Lines like "Memory had not been erased, only folded into the mineral, waiting for a reader" demonstrate precision and power amidst the lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is poetic and precise, with high information density and strong sensory imagery. Sentences like "dawn bleed pale gold" and "unfurled like luminous seaweed" are evocative and controlled. A minor deduction is applied for a few phrases that lean toward abstraction and summarizing the theme ("a quiet anthem to overlooked beauty"), which momentarily stall the otherwise excellent forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by its poetic density, rhythmic control, and precise imagery. While dense with figurative language, it avoids feeling overwritten by ensuring every metaphor serves the story's mythic tone and emotional core. The sentences are propulsive and contain no wasted words or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, it occasionally slips into scaffolding, most notably with "This was data, Lira realized," which states what the action implies. The consistently high density of figurative language, while stylistic, borders on overwriting and slightly slows momentum in places. These are minor flaws in an otherwise strong execution of a difficult style.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    While many individual sentences are poetic and well-crafted, the prose is significantly hampered by patterned repetition of key phrases. The recurrence of identical, unwieldy constructions like “half-burned diaries found in the fireplace” and “ivy-veiled passage” creates a template-like cadence that dulls momentum and reads as scaffolding rather than intentional style.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmic, with a high information density that makes every sentence work hard. Figurative language is rich but remains coherent and purposeful, avoiding ornamental clutter. The sentence structure varies to control momentum, building from quiet observation to the crescendo of her dance, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft without any noticeable artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and powerful imagery. However, its relentless figurative richness occasionally borders on overwriting, where the density of metaphor slightly impedes momentum ("meteors caromed between stars the way apologies sometimes ignite across hard decades"). While beautiful, this sheer volume of elevated language in a short space creates a texture so thick it can feel slightly overwrought. The craft is undeniable, but a touch more restraint would have perfected the line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic grace in every line. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful, such as the sky being "the color of old bone" or the river refilling "its own ghost." There are no loops or verbal tics; every sentence propels the narrative forward, creating a piece that is both efficient and profoundly beautiful.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, elegant, and highly effective, with high information density in nearly every line. The rhythm and syntax support the ceremonial, deliberate momentum of the story. While the figurative language is overwhelmingly strong, a few phrases like "bodily poetic inscriptions" verge on being overwrought, slightly clouding an otherwise pristine execution. However, there are no structural prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding, and the piece demonstrates exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, marked by high information density and striking, original imagery ("mascara had streaked like comet tails," "moths...creating ghost constellations"). Sentence structure is varied, creating a rhythm that is both serene and propulsive. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every word serves to advance the story's atmosphere or meaning. The craft is confident and professional from the first line to the last.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and immaculately controlled. Figurative language is not ornamental but fundamental to the story's world and meaning ("orchids grew like chandeliers," "mist pooled like breath"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere, demonstrating a rare combination of elegance and efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich with inventive, resonant imagery and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, the piece is slightly marred by the repetition of the awkward phrase "technically gentle," which appears twice without sufficient context to justify its peculiarity. This verbal tic reads as a prose artifact that momentarily disrupts the otherwise seamless and evocative language, preventing an otherwise exceptional piece of writing from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious, employing dense, figurative language that successfully builds a dreamlike and urgent atmosphere. While such a high density of metaphor is a risk, here it is controlled and purposeful, with varied sentence structures creating a compelling rhythm. The writing is clean, with no scaffolding or redundancy, achieving high information density on every line.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is the story's greatest strength: luminous, dense, and rhythmically flawless. Figurative language is consistently original and precise, as in "every corridor curved like a question mark toward the sky." There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and no awkward phrasing; every sentence serves to build character, atmosphere, and momentum toward the powerful, quiet conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly ambitious. Lines like "a metallic shrug between her palms" and "hair silvering like moonlight on still water" demonstrate remarkable craft. The recurring phrases ("shifting grace," "cellular memory," "while reality shifted") function as incantations rather than repetitive loops, successfully teaching a pattern. While the figurative language is relentless, it rarely muddles and instead builds a coherent, otherworldly atmosphere, creating high information density without significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with consistently stunning figurative language and high information density. Each sentence is meticulously crafted for rhythmic and atmospheric effect. There are no prose artifacts or momentum-dulling loops. The density of metaphor is high but remains coherent and purposeful, never descending into overwriting, and serving to build the story's unique world and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly beautiful and evocative, with high information density in its imagery. Sentences like "fig and apple branches threading through stone ribs like green embroidery" establish the tone and world immediately. A slight tendency towards overwriting, where nearly every sentence contains a dense metaphor (e.g., "soldered the bark with accidental wisdom"), prevents a higher score, as it occasionally risks blurring clarity with poetic abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, imagistic, and polished to a high sheen, with a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through its conceptual leaps. The figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful ('eyes ringed with nebulae,' 'ultraviolet panic'). While the style is highly ornate, it does not feel overwritten; rather, the complexity of the language mirrors the 'simply complicated' nature of the inheritance itself, demonstrating superb control and avoiding any distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with memorable images like the "shifting constellation of punctuation marks." However, there are minor artifacts. The phrase "carefully resourceful" is repeated verbatim, feeling like a label rather than an organic description. Some figurative language, while inventive, borders on being overwrought, slightly slowing momentum in key moments. These are minor issues in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating exceptional information density and sentence-level propulsion. Figurative language is consistently original and effective ("a whale carcass dreaming of music," "a compass stitched from her last breath"). There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every line is polished, purposeful, and contributes to a cohesive and powerful whole.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally graceful and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, it is marred by a few distinct artifacts that hold it back. The repetition of "warmly methodical" acts as a loop, and some phrases, like "the clear complexity of braided metaphor," lean toward abstraction rather than concrete imagery. These instances, while not pervasive, are noticeable enough to disrupt the otherwise high quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with figurative language that consistently deepens the story's atmosphere and meaning ("bloom of hush," "petals of stillness," "marrow like forgiveness"). While highly stylized, it avoids becoming overwrought, maintaining clarity and propulsion. Each sentence feels carefully weighed, contributing to a rhythmic, incantatory quality that is essential to the story’s effect.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is distinguished by its high information density and evocative, precise language ("a slow drumbeat of thistle-blown hope"). The prose is ambitious and almost entirely successful, with varied syntax that drives momentum. The only minor weakness is the slight turn toward summary in the sentence that reveals the story’s core conceit, which feels less propelled than the imagistic prose surrounding it.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and dense with purpose. Figurative language, such as "letters into bruises" and "seeping... like blood into cloth," is evocative and thematically resonant rather than merely decorative. Sentences are crafted with a strong rhythmic sense, and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding. The craftsmanship is consistently high, propelling the narrative with both beauty and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is exquisite, with inventive, vivid, and precise figurative language. Sentences are constructed with a strong sense of rhythm and propulsion. The only minor weakness is the sheer density of the metaphors; in a few passages, the prose becomes so consistently lush that it risks feeling slightly overwrought rather than economical, a hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and rhythmically controlled, marked by high information density and evocative imagery ("fray like seaweed," "stitch across the torn fabric"). Its strength is also its primary weakness; at times, the figurative language becomes slightly too dense or self-aware, as in "steam curling like questions neither asked." While generally excellent, these few moments of overwriting slightly detract from the otherwise powerful and precise craft.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with a rare density of potent and original figurative language. While this risks overwriting, here it succeeds by building the story's unique internal logic and atmosphere without sacrificing clarity or momentum. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, modulating perfectly with the story's emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, with high information density and precise, evocative word choices. While the figurative language is dense, it remains coherent and purposeful, building the story's unique atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The line explaining the vial's logic is a minor expository concession in an otherwise seamless piece of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density. However, the figurative language, while often beautiful, is so consistently dense that it borders on overwriting, slightly dulling the momentum in a few places. A demanding editor would trim a handful of descriptors to allow the strongest images, like the staircase solidifying from the air, to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and carefully crafted, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the density of figurative language is relentless, with a new simile or metaphor in almost every other sentence. While individually effective, their sheer concentration occasionally feels overwrought, creating a slight drag on momentum instead of purely enhancing it. There are no technical errors, but the texture is almost too rich.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and confident, establishing a high-concept style from the opening line and sustaining it without faltering. Figurative language is inventive and purposeful, advancing character and atmosphere in nearly every sentence. While verging on overwritten, the density feels like a deliberate and masterfully controlled stylistic choice, not a flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in every line. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it borders on being overwrought, a high-wire act that risks distracting from the narrative momentum. A sentence like the one defining the "weight" of truth leans slightly into thematic summary, a minor imperfection in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is the story's showpiece, demonstrating superb line-level craft with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is rich and purposeful, consistently building atmosphere and meaning, such as "the geometry of regret" and "petals of light peeling from the fruit." While extremely dense, the language rarely feels overwritten, as each sentence works to advance the accumulative pressure toward the climax, resulting in a polished and powerful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with many memorable images. However, there is a slight tendency towards overwriting in moments of high emotion. Phrases like "feeling its tiny weight magnify until it seemed to anchor the entire room" and the final simile comparing her words to buttons carried by soldiers are so thematically perfect they risk feeling constructed rather than perceived. This high density of figurative language slightly mutes the immediacy of a few key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language is strong and consistent ("drunk sentinel," "famine of memory") without becoming overwrought. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. The line-level craft is of a professional, publishable quality throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and surgically precise, with zero wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, as in "creasing catastrophe into a paper boat no bigger than a tear." The deliberate repetition of key phrases like "prism atrium in mist" builds an incantatory rhythm that serves the story's lyric mode rather than creating a loop.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet remains clear, propulsive, and free of artifacts. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing plot, character, or atmosphere with precision and grace. The rhythm of the sentences, especially in the final paragraphs, creates a powerful cadence that mirrors the story's falling, transformative action.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, striking imagery ("time had waited politely outside"). Sentences are crafted to build momentum without a single wasted word or clunky construction. There are no instances of scaffolding, loops, or other prose artifacts; the craft is clean and serves the story's atmospheric and thematic aims perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically dense, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. However, the figurative language is so consistently elevated that it occasionally feels overwrought, risking a loss of momentum. Phrases like "equations she carried inside her chest" or "luminous regret," while beautiful, contribute to a texture that is uniformly rich, lacking the plain-style valleys that can make peaks more impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious and consistently beautiful, with high information density and striking figurative language. While the density of metaphor is very high ("harp strung with moonlight," "grief distilled"), it rarely falters and serves the story's accumulative drive. The rhythm is controlled, sentences are varied, and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding. The sheer richness occasionally borders on overwhelming, a hairline slip that keeps it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and almost entirely free of artifacts. While the high concentration of figurative language could risk feeling overwritten, it remains coherent and purposeful within the story’s surreal, metaphorical logic. Sentence structure is varied, word choice is precise, and the momentum builds cleanly towards a powerful final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic, with high information density and strong sentence-level propulsion. The language choices are ambitious and mostly successful, creating a rich texture. The story's primary prose weakness is a tendency towards uniform figurative density; nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, which at times risks feeling overwrought and could benefit from moments of plainer contrast to heighten the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in nearly every sentence. The imagery is vivid and original ("reading elevator shafts like cardiograms," "dust...like frozen applause"). While the language is consistently elevated, it remains controlled and purposeful, avoiding indulgence. The final two paragraphs verge on being overwrought, but ultimately serve the story's transcendent, magical-realist conclusion effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and powerful imagery ("chandelier of frozen breath," "iceberg calving"). However, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwhelming, with a few images feeling slightly less fresh than others ("sugar in rain"). While the style is largely successful and integral to the story's effect, a more selective application of its most potent metaphors in the final beats could have heightened the propulsion and impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in its imagery. However, the final act drifts into strategic telling that feels slightly less potent than the showing that precedes it, particularly in the quick resolution with the Company enforcers. The final sentence ("The miners' children learned to read the crystal's shifting stories") is a dangling fragment that feels slightly less polished than the rest of this otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and confident, with high information density and evocative figurative language that rarely feels overwrought. The rhythm and syntax are varied and support the story's momentum effectively. The line "Emil’s motivation was simple and vast: to reclaim the light stolen by midnight, to return morning to children..." contains a minor paraphrase loop, a small blemish on an otherwise stellar line-level execution that holds it just shy of the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, varied syntax, and strong, evocative verbs. The figurative language is ambitious and mostly successful, creating a rich, immersive texture. A fractional deduction is applied for a few phrases in the final paragraphs ("lungs aching in that luxurious way," "petals of afternoon rain are already rehearsing their descent") that feel slightly self-conscious or overly writerly, momentarily drawing attention to the prose itself.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with many powerful images. However, there are moments where abstract thematic pronouncements substitute for dramatized interiority (e.g., "understanding that complexity could be scaffolded with simplicity"). The key phrase "turbine-hum reverie" is repeated three times; while effective as a motif, its final use feels slightly less impactful than the first two. These are minor issues in otherwise stellar line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose demonstrates a rare combination of density and clarity, with each sentence working to advance the story's atmosphere and emotional weight. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as light pouring through fretwork "like warm honey," avoiding cliché and enhancing the sensory world. The rhythm of the sentences is varied and musical, creating a propulsive yet contemplative momentum without any discernible loops, scaffolding, or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with varied syntax and strong, specific word choices. Figurative language is rich and generally effective, creating a cohesive atmosphere without halting momentum. While the density of imagery borders on overwriting in a few places, it largely serves the story's textural aims and remains clear and evocative through the climax, avoiding any significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and highly figurative, with memorable and inventive images. However, a few moments lean towards abstraction and thematic summary, slightly dulling the immediacy. For instance, "comfort offered without wound or work is only another kind of dying" and "...turns absence into space ready for presence" read more like authorial aphorisms than the character's direct, in-the-moment perception. While beautifully phrased, these instances create a minor register shift that keeps the line-level craft just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control in every line. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful, such as the wax shaving like "a scrap of dried blood," which introduces stakes and tone simultaneously. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, resulting in a polished, propulsive, and deeply evocative read.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with vivid, precise imagery and varied sentence rhythms. Figurative language is mostly stunning, though a few phrases like "the sound of glaciers deciding to forgive the sea" verge on being overwrought, slightly distracting from the otherwise grounded sensory details. The craft is clean, with no scaffolding or loops, and the final line provides a perfect, resonant cadence. The overall effect is one of high polish and confident control.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, both lyrical and precise. Figurative language is fresh and powerful (e.g., "the bell did not clang; it inhaled," "stars dripped like meltwater"). The piece demonstrates exceptional information density and sentence-level propulsion, with no wasted words, scaffolding, or line-level artifacts. The language is the story’s greatest strength, creating a powerful sense of wonder and quiet authority.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, with precise word choice and evocative imagery throughout. While the high density of figurative language is a consistent stylistic choice, it occasionally risks feeling overwritten, with metaphors layered in nearly every sentence. This relentless richness, while beautiful, can slightly overwhelm the underlying action, preventing the prose from achieving the absolute highest tier of clarity and impact under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, evocative figurative language, and controlled rhythm. Every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the narrative's textural understanding. There are no wasted words, prose artifacts, or overwrought passages; the language is rich but always serves the story's core with precision and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and evocative, original figurative language ("verdigris scales," "falling equations," "scattering time like glitter"). The prose has a deliberate rhythm that supports the story's contemplative pace without ever becoming sluggish. There are no wasted words or distracting prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and dense, operating at a very high level of craft. While the density of figurative language is significant, it serves the Accumulative/Textural drive rather than impeding it, creating a rich, immersive experience. Sentence structure is varied, word choice is precise and evocative ("crescents," "burnished," "stippled"), and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding. The piece walks a fine line, avoiding the pitfalls of overwriting through its sheer control and purposefulness, with every image contributing to the final effect.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with each sentence contributing to character, atmosphere, and momentum. Figurative language is pervasive but remains coherent and purposeful, avoiding ornamental clutter. The line-level craft is meticulous, with strong verbs and specific, sensory nouns creating a vivid and immersive texture. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the writing is exceptionally clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=5.0)
    The prose contains many striking, poetic lines but frequently verges on being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can blunt momentum. The most severe flaw, however, is the final, incomplete sentence. This is a critical technical error that abruptly cuts off the story's final image and rhythm, making the entire piece read as an unfinished draft. For a publication seeking flawless work, this is a non-negotiable issue.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and demonstrates virtuosic control at the line level. Figurative language is not an adornment but the fundamental mode of storytelling, with images like the new shoots being "thin as bayonet blades but soft" perfectly integrating theme and description. The piece is free of technical artifacts, and its momentum is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is of the highest caliber. The prose is dense with evocative, precise imagery, yet it remains clear and propulsive. Sentence structures vary to create a lyrical rhythm that perfectly matches the melancholic, watchful tone. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or the intensification of the central experience. The language is a significant source of the story's success.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently polished, evocative, and dense with meaning, propelling the narrative with a confident rhythm. Figurative language, such as the dilation field contracting "into the compass rose, which now glowed with contained time," is both beautiful and functional. A few phrases ("confusion pooling like ink") lean on familiar constructions, and one or two moments of realization are slightly more told than shown, but these are minor points in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with strong opening and closing lines. However, the final third of the story accumulates a high density of similes and metaphors ("like impatient children," "embraces the sea," "soft as forgiveness"). While individually effective, their close proximity slightly overwrites the moment, creating a figurative density that borders on excessive and slightly dulls the climax's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, lyrical, and precise. Every sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere and Mara's internal state. Figurative language is rich but never overwrought, as in "the smoke still clung to her hair like a reluctant crown." The line-level craft demonstrates remarkable control, with varied sentence structures and a powerful rhythm that carries the reader through the ritual without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless. The prose is exceptionally dense with information and imagery, yet remains lucid and propulsive. Figurative language is not decorative but foundational to the world and character, as seen in "a sound like breaking ice and newborn stars." There are no wasted words, scaffold phrases, or syntactic loops; every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the story's internal journey.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density. However, a minor flaw prevents a higher score: the central metaphor of winnowing grain from chaff/husk is stated explicitly twice ("winnow the guilt...separates chaff from grain," and later "grain separated from husk"). This slight redundancy in an otherwise masterful piece feels a touch heavy-handed, momentarily stating what the rest of the story shows so beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, there are instances of overwriting where abstract conceptual language ("the gentle acknowledgment that every story deserved its place") dulls the impact of concrete images. Some sentence structures become repetitive, particularly in the setup for the poems, slightly slowing the momentum before the powerful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense and poetic without a single misstep; every metaphor and simile deepens the atmosphere and serves the narrative. Sentence structure and rhythm are expertly controlled, moving from longer, descriptive lines to shorter, more urgent phrases as the mainspring cracks. There are no loops or wasted words; information density is exceptionally high, and the final line lands with both poetic force and narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating superb rhythm, density, and clarity. Figurative language, such as "a lightning bolt frozen mid-flash" and "roots dangling like unfinished brushstrokes," is consistently fresh and purposeful. The piece is free of scaffolding or line-level artifacts, exhibiting a polished control that propels the narrative forward with grace and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is evocative and dense with powerful imagery. However, it occasionally tips into being slightly overwritten, with figurative language that strains credulity (e.g., "ozone and copper—that tasted like screaming tenderness"). More critically, the final section contains a paraphrase loop ("She'd proven it... she'd learned..."), which slightly diffuses the momentum of an otherwise sharp conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished to a high sheen, with exceptional information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is potent and precise, as in "the moon hung thin as a paper cut" and "grief is a compass that spins until you give it somewhere to point." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to momentum and atmosphere. The line-level craft is a significant strength, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of immaculate quality, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as rain that is "soft as apology, then hard as interrogation," enhancing both atmosphere and tension. The line-level craft is free of artifacts, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating a rare combination of lyrical richness and disciplined precision.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and dense with information. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high, at times bordering on overwriting ("petals so fragile they seem to exhale"). While many images are stunning, their sheer frequency slightly dulls the impact of the strongest ones. A more selective deployment would elevate the piece from "beautifully written" to "flawless."

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language is consistently fresh and effective, such as blind fish circling “like unanswered questions,” enhancing atmosphere without ever feeling overwritten. There are no wasted words or scaffold-like phrases; every sentence works to advance character, plot, or tone, culminating in a final paragraph that lands with poetic finality and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with powerful, specific imagery ("shame...had calcified into the crown"). However, the final third includes several sentences that function as summary or scaffolding, explaining insights that the preceding actions and images had already conveyed. This slightly reduces momentum and clarity at crucial moments, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished, with virtually every sentence doing multiple jobs. While the figurative language is exceptionally frequent, it remains coherent and serves the story's specific atmosphere rather than feeling ornamental. There are no loops or redundancies; the piece demonstrates immaculate control at the line level, with a propulsion that defies its contemplative nature.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, rhythmic, and surgically precise. Figurative language is consistently fresh and effective ("chronology that scattered like spilled mercury," "teeth like cracked ice").

The piece is impeccably clean, with varied syntax and no discernible scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense with striking, original imagery ("melted starlight," "brittle armor of shame," "translucent pages... like moths"). While the figurative language is consistently high-quality, its sheer density occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly slowing momentum in a few spots. However, the overall clarity, rhythm, and propulsion are of a very high caliber, with no significant technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by information density and striking, original metaphors ("stumps glistened like open mouths mid-phrase"). The rhythm is controlled, accelerating and decelerating in step with the action. While the density of figurative language is consistently high, it rarely feels overwritten, instead building a cohesive and immersive atmosphere. There are no wasted words; every sentence contributes to character, setting, or the story's forward momentum, demonstrating superb line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and frequently beautiful, with powerful, memorable images. However, it is held back from the highest echelon by a tendency toward overwriting, with a very high density of figurative language that occasionally feels self-conscious ("snowflakes of meaning"). While the lines are clear and propelled by a strong rhythm, a more judicious use of metaphor would have sharpened the impact of the peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery. Sentences are beautifully constructed and the rhythm is controlled. A minor weakness appears in the final third with the repeated emphasis on "the mantle clock key" and "the razor edges," which, while thematically crucial, creates a slight template cadence that momentarily lessens the prose's otherwise organic flow.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. Sentences are rhythmically controlled, accelerating during the climax and settling into a quiet cadence at the resolution.

The propulsion from beginning to end is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of immediate publishable quality. It is dense with meaning, rhythmically sophisticated, and free of any loops, scaffolding, or artifacts. The figurative language is exceptional, with fresh, resonant metaphors ("Braille for regret," "metronome for memory") that are perfectly tuned to the story's emotional and thematic landscape.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=10.0)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and poetic, with every line contributing to momentum and atmosphere; there is no scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both lyrical beauty and impressive density. Figurative language is rich and inventive without becoming overwrought, and nearly every sentence serves multiple functions in advancing character, atmosphere, and plot. The piece navigates the fine line between evocative and overwritten with remarkable skill, maintaining clarity and propulsion even in its most poetic moments.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, varied syntax, and powerful, specific imagery. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or momentum. The figurative language is potent and integrated, though a couple of individual phrases ("thick as velvet") are slightly more conventional than the rest of the luminous prose.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest literary quality: dense, precise, and stunningly evocative. Figurative language is both original and integral, such as darkness swallowing constellations "the way oil swallows flame" or starlight cutting darkness into strips that "fluttered like torn silk." There is zero scaffolding, redundancy, or rhythmic monotony; every word and sentence is calibrated for maximum impact, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. It is virtually flawless at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant, but a key structural choice weakens the climax. The impact of the displays is conveyed through a list-like summary of epiphanies ("A hurried accountant saw... A teenager saw..."). This instance of telling, rather than dramatizing, feels overly neat and lessens the emotional power of the story's peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates high information density. However, the sheer volume of figurative language—with nearly every sentence containing a metaphor or heightened image—borders on being overwritten. This extreme density, while often beautiful, occasionally risks drawing more attention to the style than the substance, slightly impeding narrative momentum in what is a very short, high-pressure piece.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, with high information density in most lines ("blades slicing the mandated silence," "shavings curling like pale feathers"). The rhythm is controlled and supports the story's solemn pace. A minor repetitive artifact exists in the repeated phrase "dramatically narrating," which calls slight attention to the authorial hand, preventing a higher score, but the overall craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative, rhythmic prose. The story avoids common prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding. However, the repetition of the phrase "aesthetically driven" stands out as a minor tic; it's a high-register, analytical term that slightly interrupts the otherwise seamless, sensory flow in two key moments, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and polished, with every sentence advancing the story. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, never ornamental ("voice rough as ground frit," "quivered like a trapped moth"). The piece exhibits masterful rhythmic control, particularly in the parallel sentence structures of the final third, and is entirely free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating pristine line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and rhythmically controlled, with a high density of meaning in every sentence. Figurative language is consistently fresh and coherent, building a unified atmospheric and emotional world ("jars clink like bells at vespers"). The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting; its richness is a feature of its disciplined, lyrical style, not an artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently beautiful, marked by inventive metaphors and a controlled, poetic rhythm. However, its greatest strength is also a minor weakness: the extreme density of figurative language. With nearly every sentence carrying a metaphor, the piece occasionally feels overwritten, which can slightly dilute the impact of individual images and prioritize aesthetic performance over emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and highly polished, with striking and memorable lines throughout. The rhythm and syntax are controlled, effectively mirroring the story's ritualistic progression. The only minor friction is the sheer density of figurative language, which, while beautiful, occasionally verges on being overwrought. A slightly lighter touch in a few places might have let the strongest images resonate even more.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, rhythmic, and rich with figurative language that consistently serves the story's atmosphere and themes. While verging on overwriting in its density, it maintains clarity and propulsion throughout. The line-level craft is meticulous, with varied syntax and strong verbs, and it is free of noticeable scaffolding or repetitive loops. The language is the story's primary engine, and it performs powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and highly crafted, with high information density and strong momentum. Figurative language is rich and generally effective ("petals folding into talons"). The intentional repetition of phrases like "softly deliberate" and "luminous regret" creates powerful resonance rather than feeling like an artifact. While the density of metaphor is very high, it remains coherent and serves the story's atmospheric goals without obscuring clarity, even in the peak moments of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with a strong, confident rhythm. Figurative language is rich and generally effective, such as the chameleon's scales catching starlight "like shattered opal." While the density of metaphors borders on overwriting in a few places ("stars blurring into silver bruises"), it largely serves the story's "shimmering stillness" and does not impede clarity or momentum. The line-level craft is otherwise immaculate, with no loops, scaffolding, or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense with information and imagery, yet flawlessly clear and propulsive. Figurative language ("horizon like a scalpel," "clean linen of acceptance") is never ornamental; it consistently deepens character and anticipates action. The sentences possess a confident rhythm that modulates perfectly with the story's emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates immense line-level control, with almost no wasted words. Figurative language is rich and consistent with the story's world, such as "balcony as clavicle, aisles as ribs." There are no discernible loops or scaffolding. The rhythm of the sentences effectively modulates the story's emotional intensity, building to the climax and settling into a quiet, resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates a masterful command of rhythm and imagery. However, in its pursuit of lyricism, the density of figurative language occasionally becomes overwrought, with metaphors stacked in quick succession ("ribbons writhing like ink in water," followed by the archway's "low vibration," then words "riding the resonance"). While controlled, these moments slightly blur the line between powerful prose and poetic excess, a hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and consistently beautiful, marked by powerful verbs and striking figurative language. While the sheer density of metaphor occasionally borders on being overwritten, it ultimately serves the story's mythic quality without sacrificing clarity at key moments. The rhythm and pacing are controlled, creating a hypnotic effect that draws the reader into its surreal logic. A slight restraint in a few passages might have heightened the impact even further.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.5)

The sentence structure is varied, providing a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the narrative. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is outstanding: concise, imagistic, and rhythmically sophisticated. Every sentence carries weight, advancing plot, character, or atmosphere without a single wasted word or clunky phrase. The final sentence fragment is a technically audacious and emotionally resonant choice, capping a piece with flawless line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, with evocative and precise language ("bled violet," "luminous whales," "cat-light"). Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm. While the phrase "thunderous serenity" is used twice, it's a deliberate framing device for the dominant tone. There are no significant loops or scaffolding; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or understanding, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its use of imagery. The rhythm is varied and the word choice is precise. While the high density of figurative language is mostly effective and consistent with the tone, a few phrases like "curled within like a question mark" border on cliché, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and demonstrates high information density in every line. Word choice is consistently strong and evocative ("wind-sculpted pines," "second pulse"). The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, and the syntax varies to control momentum, slowing for reflection and remaining steady for action. This is clean, confident, and impactful line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished and powerfully evocative, with high information density in every line. While the figurative language is extremely dense, it almost always serves to deepen the surreal atmosphere rather than obscure it. The sentence structure is varied and propulsive, particularly during the descent sequence, which reads as both action and internal monologue. A minor critique is the sheer volume of metaphor, which borders on overwriting but ultimately succeeds due to its consistency and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is mostly elegant and precise, with striking images like "spirals that hurt to perceive directly." However, there are minor instances of explanatory phrasing that could be more concrete. The critical flaw is the final incomplete sentence, a fundamental failure of line-level craft that abruptly halts the narrative momentum and leaves the story structurally unsound at its conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistically dense, with phrases like "suspended ink" and "lullaby sharpened to a knife" demonstrating high craft. While the figurative language is overwhelmingly a strength, a few phrases like "quantified suddenly, heartbeat versus regime" or "microwaved silence" feel slightly more abstract or less fresh than the surrounding text. These are hairline slips in an otherwise stellar execution that does not suffer from any significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently elevated and imagistic, achieving a high level of craft. However, its relentless density of figurative language sometimes feels overwrought, especially in moments that might have benefited from sparer prose to heighten tension. Certain phrases like "slide the blade of tomorrow into a scabbard of yesterday" are beautifully constructed but feel more like authorial aphorisms than character thoughts, slightly impeding momentum without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft and information density, with every sentence contributing to atmosphere and momentum. While the metaphorical language is incredibly rich, it remains coherent and purposeful, avoiding the pitfalls of overwriting by ensuring each image builds upon the story's internal logic. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; the piece is polished to a mirror finish.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional line-level control, with no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistently inventive and precise, turning what could be overwriting into a powerful, sustained stylistic choice. The final few paragraphs contain slightly more abstract summary ("the confession rewritten as smaller confessions") than the preceding concrete scene work, a minor shift in texture that is the only hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, marked by high information density, startlingly original figurative language ("original metronome of grief"), and a controlled, evocative rhythm. Sentences are concise yet rich, advancing the narrative without a single wasted word or clichéd construction. It is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, representing a very high level of line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and rhythmically controlled, with figurative language that is both original and purposeful. Every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the story's emotional state. While the sheer density of metaphor borders on overwriting, it remains coherent and serves the story's otherworldly tone without collapsing into purple prose. There are no technical flaws, loops, or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with dense, evocative figurative language and a strong, varied rhythm. Each sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the story's textural goals. The only minor flaw is the abrupt, incomplete final sentence ("the hundred fractured<|reserved_token_163609|>"), which feels like a transcription error that slightly mars the otherwise perfect cadence of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, with high information density and exquisite sentence-level rhythm. Figurative language is inventive and purposeful, consistently reinforcing character and theme. The density of metaphor is immense and almost overwhelming at times, which is the only element holding it back from perfection; however, it remains coherent and avoids muddle, even in its most complex constructions like "dew that is also stage light."

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propelled by a strong internal rhythm. Figurative language is abundant but always purposeful, creating a cohesive and immersive texture rather than feeling overwritten ("air itself folded like silk," "tiny mirrors of doubt").

There are no loops or scaffolding; the craft is invisible and highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Word choice is precise and evocative ("dreams leaking outward in slow pulses of indigo curiosity"), and figurative language is integral to the story's synesthetic logic, never feeling ornamental. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and highly polished read.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic, demonstrating high craft. However, the density of figurative language is extremely high, at times bordering on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor ("sun bled into the stone," "shelves rose like petrified waves," "rays caught like insects"). While this creates a rich, mythic texture that serves the story's tone, a more restrained hand in a few key moments could have allowed the most powerful images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density. The rhythm is controlled, accelerating during the descent and slowing for moments of reflection. Figurative language is often striking (“gulls wheeled like torn paper”). The piece avoids any significant loops or scaffolding, maintaining momentum. The only minor weakness is that the moments of explicit thematizing, while primarily a Q5 issue, feel slightly less sharp than the surrounding imagistic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by dense, evocative language and a strong, rhythmic cadence. While the figurative language is relentless, it rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story’s unique texture and thematic depth. The piece is remarkably clean of line-level artifacts, with each sentence working to advance the story’s accumulative power.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly polished, with a strong, varied rhythm and precise word choice. Figurative language is evocative and generally well-integrated ("caught the dying light like spider silk"). The piece avoids common line-level artifacts like loops or template cadence. The only minor friction is the sheer density of metaphor, which at moments verges on feeling overwrought, slightly impeding momentum rather than accelerating it, but this is a very minor issue in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, but its primary strength—a high density of figurative language—is also a minor weakness. In a few passages, the similes stack up so quickly ("like a silent goodbye," "like low stars," "like tears of relief") that they slightly diminish one another's impact. While the piece avoids cliché and maintains clarity, a slightly more restrained hand would allow the most powerful images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic variety, and stunningly original figurative language that rarely feels overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is exquisite, with high information density and a varied, musical rhythm. The prose is ambitious and almost entirely successful in its dense figuration. A few phrases, like "clouds still full of forest than rain," introduce a flicker of opacity that requires rereading, a hairline imperfection that prevents a perfect score but doesn't detract from the story's propulsive beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with virtually no wasted words. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the story's momentum, particularly during the climax. Figurative language, such as the signal being "a ghost sliding into a possessed body," is both original and functionally precise, enhancing clarity rather than obscuring it. The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or other prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic propulsion in every sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with almost every line performing multiple functions. Sentences like "He carried no sketchbook, only a brass locket pinned inside his coat" and "letting absence speak in the furrowed hush" demonstrate exceptional concision and power. The craft is nearly flawless, with a varied sentence structure and a rhythm that supports the story's hushed, deliberate momentum. There are no notable loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative, with no overwriting or wasted sentences. Figurative language is strong and integrated ("pages tattooed with coded stanzas that fluttered like trapped moths"). The deliberate repetition of "nervously confident" functions as a successful character motif rather than a prose artifact, reinforcing her internal state at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and a propulsive, poetic rhythm. Figurative language is dense but purposeful, creating a cohesive dream-like texture without becoming overwrought or obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language is rich and consistent with the story's lyrical mode, avoiding cliché and rarely feeling overwritten. Sentences like "spreading a collection of foreign paper money across the warped floorboards as though dealing tarot" do significant work in establishing character, setting, and theme simultaneously. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, and its rhythm is controlled and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm is well-paced, creating a dreamlike momentum. There are no significant prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding. A few phrases lean towards familiar poeticisms ("night poured in, thick as ink"), but for the most part, the word choice is precise and the imagery is strong. The craft is clean and professional, successfully supporting the story's atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.4)
    While the prose is dense with figurative language, it remains controlled, coherent, and purposeful, enhancing the mythic atmosphere rather than obscuring it. The climactic beats exhibit restraint, allowing action to carry the narrative weight. The piece demonstrates high information density and syntactic variety with no loops or scaffolding, showcasing exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is largely beautiful, with a strong opening and high information density. However, the story is marred by a significant prose artifact: the repeated use of "purposefully curious" and "anxious elation." This loop-like phrasing, while thematically relevant, dulls the impact through repetition and reads like a scaffold, preventing the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished, demonstrating high-level craft in every line. Figurative language is abundant but feels integral to the world's logic rather than ornamental, as in "sap beaded like blood." The rhythm is varied and sentence structure is sophisticated, creating momentum and a rich texture that carries the story's emotional and thematic weight effortlessly. There are no notable prose artifacts or momentum drags.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. It shifts effectively between the lyrical sentences of reflection and the clipped, factual recitation of the artifact's history, mirroring the character's internal conflict. The figurative language is coherent, character-driven, and entirely free of clutter or cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently beautiful, with high information density and a varied, elegant rhythm. The figurative language is rich and serves the story's accumulative design. However, the sheer density of metaphor occasionally borders on being overwrought, a stylistic choice that risks overwhelming the narrative action. While it doesn't break clarity, a touch more restraint in a few moments could have heightened the impact of the most critical images, keeping it just shy of flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.1)
    For most of its length, the prose is stunning, with high information density and evocative, rhythmic sentences. However, the story ends with an incomplete sentence fragment: "...fed by contradictions she". This reads as a critical copy-editing error, not a stylistic choice, and it severely damages the momentum and polish of the final closing image. This single, glaring flaw at the most crucial point of the story necessitates a significant deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, marked by high information density and rhythmic control. However, the density of figurative language becomes excessive in key moments, constituting a form of overwriting. Phrases like "latent radiance stirring like dawn beneath skin" and the "fracture in the armor" line, while evocative, are stacked so closely they begin to dull momentum rather than sharpen the image. This consistent reliance on metaphor creates a textural muddle that slightly obscures the raw emotion of the peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional control, balancing lyrical density with absolute clarity. Figurative language is not ornamental but foundational to the story's meaning, as in "The ivy had swallowed the station whole, green tongues licking rust from the rails." The piece is free of line-level artifacts; even repeated phrases like "daringly methodical" are purposeful echoes that build thematic resonance between the character and the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is rich and evocative, with consistently strong imagery and high information density. However, there is a minor but noticeable template cadence in a key sequence of discovery ("She opened... She understood... She walked... She pressed..."), which slightly flattens the rhythm. The repetition of the phrase "cyclically reversed" also reads as a minor prose artifact. These small imperfections in an otherwise masterful execution prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, employing dense figurative language with precision and control. While highly lyrical, the sentences remain clear and propulsive, with every metaphor serving the story's thematic and atmospheric goals. The piece avoids overwriting by ensuring its rich imagery is internally consistent and builds a coherent symbolic landscape, resulting in a text with zero redundancy and high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and almost entirely free of scaffolding. Word choice is precise and evocative ("beautician mortician," "geometry of a final sigh"), creating a rich texture that carries the narrative. The rhythm and syntax vary to match the story's emotional cadence, moving from watchful stillness to the crescendo of the climax and back to a quiet resolution. The repetition of "lucidly watchful" works as a successful, intentional echo that links the protagonist to the souls she has tended.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is rich, dense, and rhythmic, with a very high level of craft. The repetition of "scalloped" is a successful, intentional motif that unifies disparate images. While the density of figurative language borders on overwriting, it remains coherent and serves the story's specific, elevated tone without sacrificing clarity or momentum. There are no significant loops or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's texture and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is ambitious and highly figurative, creating a rich texture. For the most part, this density works, but occasional phrases ("shimmering sincerely insincere") feel slightly overwrought and hinder momentum. The sentence-level craft is otherwise strong, with varied rhythms and high information density, but the sheer volume of metaphors verges on excess.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate: dense, evocative, and surgically precise. There is zero scaffolding or redundancy; every word contributes to momentum, atmosphere, and meaning. The figurative language ("time folded like silk," "the water’s dark grammar") is not ornamental but essential to the story's mechanics. The sentence and paragraph structure creates a contemplative rhythm that perfectly mirrors the meditative state of the protagonist. This is line-level craft of the highest order.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled. While rich with figurative language, it avoids feeling overwritten because each image serves the central theme and moves the character's understanding forward. The repetition of key phrases is a deliberate and effective structural device, not a flaw; it creates a hypnotic cadence that pulls the reader deeper into the story's unique logic. There are no wasted words or unforced errors; every line contributes to the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density. The rhythm is varied and propulsive. The only weakness is a slight shift into summary at the very end, where the narration explains the meaning of Elian’s actions. While the majority of the story is a masterclass in showing, this final moment of telling prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense with original, evocative imagery ("sky lantern release began, each paper bloom drifting upward like a slow meteor hush") yet propelled by a clear narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely flawless. Strong, specific verbs and startlingly precise images propel the narrative.

The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, with no discernible loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, with high information density in most lines ("The strands fell like spilled ink," "mortar dissolving into starlight"). The rhythm is controlled, creating a sense of deliberate, ritualistic pacing. While largely excellent, a few phrases lean into well-worn territory ("glowed like captured starlight") and the prose occasionally becomes so dense with figurative language that it risks feeling slightly overwrought for a moment of intense focus.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, polished, and highly evocative, with a remarkable information density where nearly every sentence serves multiple functions. Word choice is precise and poetic without becoming overwrought, and the rhythm of the sentences supports the story's quiet, focused tension. While the style is consistently elevated, it remains purposeful and clear, avoiding the pitfalls of purple prose. There are no wasted words or clumsy constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous, dense with meaning, and rhythmically controlled. Opening lines like "The floating rock dojo drifted above the rewritten Pacific, its tatami mats glowing with residual chronal heat" are immediately immersive. The piece is nearly flawless at the line level, but the final, aphoristic line on the scroll feels less crafted than the rest of the prose, slightly dulling the sharpness of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. The use of recurring phrases like "storm-born silence" and "across the hush of a possibility just born" functions as a successful poetic refrain rather than a repetitive loop, reinforcing the story's accumulative power. Sentence structure is varied, word choice is precise, and there are no discernible prose artifacts to stall momentum or obscure the potent final imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is evocative, dense, and propelled by strong, specific verbs ("prowling," "macerated," "coaxing"). The sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, creating a hypnotic momentum. While the repetition of "macerated" verges on a mannerism, it functions as a deliberate, unifying motif that connects the initial state of the laughter, the breaking of the silence, and the final transformation of grief. The line-level craft is otherwise clean and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.5)
    For nearly its entire length, the prose is exquisite, marked by high information density, varied rhythm, and precise, evocative language. However, the story is severely marred by its final two words, the fragment "Uncertainty curled". This appears to be a technical error, but as written, it creates a jarring and clumsy end that disrupts the resonant rhythm of the preceding sentence and significantly dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language, and executed with remarkable control. Sentences are information-rich and rhythmically varied, propelling the narrative forward while building a thick, resonant atmosphere. While the metaphorical density is exceptionally high, it remains coherent and purposeful, functioning as a core part of the story's world-building rather than mere ornament. There are no notable loops or line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, yet every image serves to build the story's unique "serenely electric" atmosphere without sacrificing clarity or momentum. The language demonstrates high information density, with lines like "discarding assumptions the way a snake sheds skin" doing significant character and thematic work. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the craft is polished and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, rhythmic prose, and precise, evocative word choice. Figurative language is deployed with purpose and coherence, building the world's strange logic rather than merely decorating it. The piece is remarkably free of scaffolding or redundancy; every sentence propels the narrative forward with grace and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistently strong and world-reinforcing, such as blood evaporating into equations. The syntax and rhythm vary effectively to match the rising tension, and the line-level craft is free of repetitive patterns or clichés, creating a polished and immersive reading experience from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density, varied sentence structures, and powerful, unconventional imagery ("pressure felt like forgiveness"). The prose maintains momentum and clarity even as it delves into abstract concepts like navigating by "the memory of gravity." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to deepen character, atmosphere, and the story's central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density in its imagery. The line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence structures and precise word choices creating momentum. While a few sentences lean toward direct telling (“Mara was persistently curious by trade and by nature”), the piece is free of significant clutter, loops, or overwriting, resulting in a clean and impactful read.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is superb, with evocative and rhythmically compelling sentences. The prose is dense with figurative language that, for the most part, builds a singular atmosphere without overwhelming the narrative momentum. A few images, like the "photograph developing in reverse," tread close to cliché, representing a minor slip in an otherwise pristine execution.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically rich, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative, solemn mood effectively. The primary flaw is the inclusion of several abstract, summary-like sentences ("to fetch wisdom from failure...") that function as authorial scaffolding, momentarily breaking the "show, don't tell" covenant and slightly dulling the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by its information density and precise, evocative word choice. Every sentence works to build the story's unique atmosphere and logic. While the figurative language is relentlessly dense ("phonetic dust," "residue of forgotten consonants"), it serves the story's textural purpose and remains clear, avoiding the pitfall of becoming overwrought or obscuring the action.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, precise, and consistently inventive, with figurative language that is both original and integral to the story's logic ("voices compressed into static like fossils in amber"). Each sentence carries significant weight, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the line-level craft is polished to a high sheen, creating a propulsive and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically rich, with a high density of information and purposeful syntax. The recurring phrase "resonantly soft" functions as an effective motif rather than a repetitive tic. While the sheer density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwrought, it rarely obscures clarity. The primary weakness is the shift to a more abstract, less imagistic register for the thematic summary near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lyrical and dense with high-impact figurative language. While overwhelmingly effective, it occasionally borders on being overworked. The triple repetition of the label "respectfully rebellious," while defining character, feels slightly insistent and moves from trait to tagline. This minor self-consciousness is the only element holding the line-level craft back from perfection, a hairline crack in an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently strong, with inventive, resonant figurative language ("cracks sealed like closing mouths"). The rhythm is controlled and sentences are densely packed with meaning. The primary weakness is a slight drift towards summary and abstraction in the final two paragraphs. Phrases like "to interpret silence as possibility" and "ensuring the ride never truly stopped" explain the theme more than they embody it, creating a minor drag on the momentum of an otherwise impeccably rendered final image.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=10.0)
    The prose is flawless and a model of economy and elegance. Every sentence is load-bearing, rich with startlingly fresh and specific imagery ("drool pooling into a perfect Möbius strip," "a cloth woven from forgotten punch cards"). The language is sophisticated without being overwrought, and the rhythm is controlled beautifully, accelerating in the surreal middle and settling into a resonant calm at the end. There are zero artifacts, loops, or wasted phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is exquisite, with dense, startlingly original imagery and a powerful, varied rhythm. Nearly every sentence carries significant weight. The score is held back from the highest tier only by a few phrases in the denouement that slip into a slightly more explanatory or generic register ("changed, charged, and catalogued"), a minor departure from the stunning specificity that defines the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, a stylistic choice executed with confidence and consistency. While ornate, the language rarely feels overwritten; sentences are economical, often performing multiple functions of characterization, setting, and plot advancement simultaneously. The line "up and down braided together" is a perfect example of prose mirroring action. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, maintaining clear propulsion despite its poetic richness.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and polished, with virtually every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. Figurative language is both beautiful and purposeful, as in "the knife flashing like a comet," which connects a domestic memory to the cosmic stakes. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating a level of line-by-line control that is immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative, controlled figurative language. Each sentence propels the narrative forward with a deliberate, rhythmic cadence. The prose is clean, with no wasted words, and the final fragmented sentence lands with immense weight and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is remarkably dense and poetic, yet maintains clarity and momentum. Figurative language consistently does narrative work, such as "his hands began to silver like moonlit bark," which conveys the physical cost of the magic. While the style verges on being overwrought, it is so controlled and purposeful for the mythic tone that it succeeds without stumbling into purple prose. Every sentence serves the accumulative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language that is largely effective and evocative ("mouths sewn shut by invisible knots," "silence spilled out like silver scales"). While the density borders on being overwrought, it stays just on the right side of the line, creating a rich, immersive texture. The sentence-level propulsion is strong, and the rhythm modulates well with the action of the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative language ("each drop a soft percussion on the stone"). The prose is clean and propulsive, with no discernible overwriting, scaffolding, or looped phrasing. Every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or the advancement of the central mystery, demonstrating a rare level of polish and control.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking imagery, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Sentences like "The ship’s library settled on the ocean floor like a dream that had forgotten to wake" are flawless. The score is held back slightly by the aphoristic nature of the final written sentence, which feels constructed and less organic than the prose surrounding it, creating a minor textural artifact at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and striking imagery (“petals flattened into parchment-thin memory”). The line-level craft is exceptional, though a few phrases carry a faint echo of prompt language (e.g., “driftingly alert presence”) that feels slightly less organic than the surrounding text. This is a hairline flaw that only slightly mars an otherwise pristine execution.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and packed with vivid, purposeful imagery. The sentence-level craft is consistently high, with a strong rhythm that matches the story's emotional trajectory. The density of figurative language is on the high end but remains coherent and avoids obscuring the action, culminating in the perfect final metaphor of laughter like "engines restarting in midair."

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lyrical and ambitious, with strong, evocative imagery. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting due to the high density of figurative language, creating a slight sense of strain. A key line, "The quiet explosive moment came when...," is a prose artifact that tells rather than shows, momentarily flattening the story's most critical beat.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and highly polished, with strong verbs and evocative, specific imagery. While the figurative language is exceptionally rich, it occasionally borders on overwriting, with nearly every sentence containing a metaphor or simile. However, within the story's lyrical, accumulative mode, this density successfully builds atmosphere rather than obscuring momentum. The rhythm and sentence structure are varied and controlled, creating a propulsive, incantatory feel that serves the story's high stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and dense with striking images, demonstrating strong line-level craft and rhythmic control. Most sentences advance the narrative with precision. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward overwriting where figurative language becomes more decorative than functional, and the final sentence's shift into direct thematic summary reads as a craft misstep, telling the reader what the rest of the story has already shown.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is incredibly dense with figurative language, a high-risk strategy that succeeds due to the consistency and coherence of the imagery. The sentence-level rhythm is controlled and purposeful, accelerating and decelerating with the action. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line contributes to the story's potent atmosphere and forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density and evocative, specific imagery ("brambled hope," "blackboard of possibility"). The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-crafted, with no discernible loops or scaffolding. The only minor imperfection is a slight shift toward summary in the final paragraph, which slightly dulls the impact of the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high-density, inventive figurative language that is both beautiful and precise ("smile split like a fault line through porcelain centuries"). While the style is lush, it never becomes overwrought or sacrifices clarity; every image serves to build the story's atmosphere and thematic depth. The piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a rare level of polish and control.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise language. While the prose is rich with figurative language ("Twilight curled the sky the color of moldy lace"), it rarely feels overwritten, instead serving to build the strange reality of the world. The syntax is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the reader forward. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every sentence serves a purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by a strong, varied rhythm. Figurative language is generally precise and powerful, particularly in its connection to the story's central scientific metaphor. The repetition of "symphonically minded" and "loosened grief" works as a successful lyrical motif. A minor deduction is made for a few phrases that lean toward cliché ("fault line running through her own heart") and the slight thematic over-explanation at the end which momentarily stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and poetic, with each sentence carrying significant atmospheric and narrative weight. While the high concentration of figurative language pushes boundaries, it remains coherent and serves the story's fantastical tone. Rhythm and syntactic control are strong, creating momentum without any notable loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is constant but never feels decorative; it is the fundamental logic of the story's world and character. Every sentence works to advance the narrative's unique sensory experience. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or wasted words—it is a pristine and highly polished piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often stunningly beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, the figurative density is so high that it occasionally verges on being overwrought, with similes and metaphors packed into nearly every sentence. While this creates a rich texture, it sometimes slightly impedes momentum and clarity, as in the pile-up of "starch and rust and song were now sweet, harmonious."

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose is often elegant, but it is marred by significant repetition artifacts. The phrase "During this period of profound transformation" appears three times, functioning as rote scaffolding rather than purposeful rhythm. Similarly, "chaotically precise" is reused. These loops disrupt momentum and suggest a reliance on template phrasing, weakening an otherwise strong line-level craft and dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are minor repetitive artifacts; "clandestinely luminous" is used three times and "latent blaze" twice, which feels like a slight stylistic crutch rather than an intentional, re-weighted motif. The consistently high density of figurative language, while impressive, borders on overwriting and slightly impedes momentum in a few places.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and evocative figurative language that rarely feels overwrought. Sentences have a varied, musical rhythm that propels the quiet narrative forward without a single wasted word or clunky construction. The piece is a model of clarity and concision, free of loops or scaffolding, culminating in a powerful, earned final image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm ("a knight's awkward L-shape could fork a king and queen in elegant catastrophe"). However, it occasionally tips into overwriting with abstract, dense phrases that hinder clarity. The final paragraph devolves into summary, telling the reader what Kael will do rather than letting the final image carry the weight of the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.3)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from a relentless density of figurative language. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, which ultimately weighs the narrative down and feels overwrought. This decorative excess, such as harmonics "that tasted of lavender and rust," slows momentum and undermines the clarity of pivotal moments through sheer accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely flawless. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to support the quiet, meditative momentum. While some figurative language borders on being overly lush (e.g., "lullaby breath, the hush before a kiss"), it remains consistent with the established mythic voice and avoids distracting from the story's core progression.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is elegant, propulsive, and dense with information without feeling overwritten. Figurative language is fresh and consistently reinforces the story’s unique atmosphere ("voices trapped in glass," "constellation of glinting shards"). The line-level craft is nearly flawless, with varied sentence structures and strong verbs driving momentum toward a clean, impactful climax and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is consistently strong, characterized by high information density and evocative, specific language ("bruise-blue dawn," "compress against bleeding memory"). The rhythm of the sentences effectively modulates with the scene's tension. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and polished piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high informational and figurative density. However, the relentless cascade of metaphors and similes occasionally risks overwriting, and a few key lines substitute abstract summary for concrete action (e.g., "rose became the ache of beauty"). While the overall effect is powerful, these moments represent a minor lapse in an otherwise exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, varied sentence structure, and precise, evocative language ("bled silver wind," "fracture...where the note of opening had become the note of breaking"). The prose is clean and propulsive, with no discernible loops or scaffolding. Its quality is a primary strength of the work.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is audacious in its density of figurative language, a high-risk style that succeeds completely. Each sentence is crafted for maximum impact and information, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating exceptional control over rhythm and syntax to match the story's emotional and conceptual beats.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently beautiful, but it walks a fine line with its high density of figurative language, which occasionally feels overwrought. There is a minor paraphrase loop where the pendant's function is described in two consecutive, near-redundant sentences ("It was as though the tiny wing had learned... Each heartbeat’s echo stretched..."). While the overall effect is strong, these moments of excess slightly compromise the crystalline clarity the piece otherwise achieves.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong, evocative imagery ("velvet soaked in rain," "fractal scripts"). However, there's a slight over-reliance on certain key phrases like "shifted hush," which risks turning a potent image into a repetitive tic. More critically, the final paragraphs become less imagistic and more declarative, which flattens the prose and stalls the momentum built by the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently beautiful, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, the story suffers from a minor flaw in its final two paragraphs, which repeat phrasing from the opening ("In the forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest...") and offer a thematic summary. This slight redundancy and explicit statement of theme ("rewoven into a bridge") slightly dulls the closure's impact, preventing an otherwise flawless execution from achieving a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, with striking and original figurative language ("dawn in reverse," "shadows striping the apple-red soil like bruises"). Every sentence carries weight, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere with remarkable economy. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the line-level craft demonstrates a rare level of precision and artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and varied sentence structures that create a compelling rhythm. Figurative language, such as the bay folding like paper, is both imaginative and clear. A few phrases lean towards familiar constructions ("weight of a withheld truth pressed against her ribs"), but these are minor slips in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece with no significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and highly crafted, but it occasionally nears the edge of being overwrought. The repetition of "luminescent ache" in one paragraph is a minor paraphrase loop that could be tightened. The final, beautiful image of bottling the feeling, while thematically perfect, relies on a highly abstract concept described with physical verbs ("let the ache drip—slow, silver, luminescent") that feels slightly self-conscious, a hairline fracture in an otherwise flawless surface.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and striking, original metaphors that consistently serve the story's accumulative momentum. While the density of figurative language is immense, it rarely feels excessive, instead building a cohesive and immersive textural reality. Sentences like "constellations pressed against the panes like curious fish" and "wars that had not yet agreed to happen" display a rare level of precision and imagination. The rhythm and syntax vary to match the escalating action, propelling the reader toward the explosive climax without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, with precise word choice and a strong, varied rhythm. The consistent use of rich, figurative language builds a cohesive, dreamlike world. The primary flaw is that the final few sentences shift from resonant, imagistic prose into abstract, declarative statements that explain the story's meaning, slightly dulling the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is often luminous ("moonlight pooled like spilled mercury"), but it occasionally drifts into abstraction where concrete imagery would be stronger. Some conceptual phrasing ("The core concept of quantified sorrow weighed on her mind") slightly slows momentum, and there are minor paraphrase loops around key themes, preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, a high-risk strategy that pays off due to its consistency and clarity. While verging on overwriting, the imagery consistently serves to build the world and atmosphere without becoming muddled or contradictory. Sentence structure is varied, propulsion is maintained, and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding, resulting in a piece that is polished at the line level and rhythmically captivating.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates high-level craft, with strong verbs and varied sentence structures. The primary weakness is a tendency toward overwriting; the density of figurative language is so high that it occasionally calls attention to itself, slightly impeding the emotional immediacy of a beat. Lines like "shortening by the syllable" are clever but risk feeling more ornate than immersive in a moment of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense with imagery, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. However, a few phrases, such as "voice heuristically gentle," feel slightly too authorial and intellectualized, momentarily breaking the otherwise seamless flow of the character's perception. While a minor point, this slight register drift in a key moment prevents a perfect score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. The repeated phrase "While illusions faded to memory" functions effectively as a taught, lyrical refrain that structures the narrative and deepens thematically with each use. The line-level craft is otherwise clean, propulsive, and free of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is luminous and controlled, with high information density and evocative figurative language. However, the story ends on an incomplete sentence ("some sil"), a critical copy-editing failure that breaks the final image and severely damages an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high-density figurative language that consistently builds world and atmosphere rather than feeling ornamental. Sentences are rhythmic and varied, carrying momentum effortlessly. While the sheer volume of metaphor is a high-risk strategy that could feel overwritten, here it succeeds by establishing a cohesive, synesthetic reality that feels integral to the story's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with powerful and original figurative language. Every sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere and internal state. While the sheer density of metaphor ("dawn-colored sorrow refracted through every prism until the air itself seems to weep") borders on excessive, it remains coherent within the story's heightened, lyrical mode. There are no technical flaws, loops, or wasted words; it's a display of immense control.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, polished, and evocative. Each sentence carries significant weight, advancing character, world, and plot simultaneously (e.g., "her ink was mixed from copper sulfate and hope"). Word choice is precise and imagery is strong. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the writing is exceptionally clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elevated and imagistic, a high-wire act that the author sustains with impressive control. The density of figurative language is a deliberate stylistic choice that establishes the story's fable-like register. Sentences are varied in structure, creating a compelling rhythm, and word choice is precise ("tempered bronze petals," "liquid prisms"). While verging on overwriting, the piece teaches its poetic logic early and never violates it, resulting in a cohesive and immersive texture without significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with high information density in its figurative language. However, there are minor flaws, such as the slightly looped phrasing in "evacuation was not the same as resolution; the static inside him demanded containment, not flight." More significantly, the final log entry—"fear transformed; static resolved"—is a jarring shift into flat, utilitarian language that breaks from the established lyrical voice.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, with a strong rhythm and high information density in most lines. The opening is particularly effective. There are a few instances where the lyrical quality tips into cliché ("tears cutting clean paths down dust-covered cheeks") or becomes slightly overwrought. These moments are infrequent but prevent the prose from achieving flawless execution, keeping it just shy of the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative but maintains exceptional clarity and momentum. Sentences are information-rich, performing multiple functions of characterization, world-building, and atmosphere simultaneously. The piece successfully avoids overwriting by ensuring each metaphor and poetic phrase serves the core action, as seen in the elegant fusion of movement and meaning: "Her ankle flicked, translating 7-Q-2 into a low sweep."

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in every line. Figurative language, such as memories as "frozen chandeliers" or a "knot of absence," is consistently inventive and thematically coherent. While the imagery is dense, it never feels overwritten; instead, it contributes to the story's potent, dreamlike atmosphere without sacrificing clarity or momentum. The sentence-level craft is polished to a very high standard.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and rhythmically complex, with high information density. However, it is marked by a noticeable text artifact: the phrase "terrestrially cosmic" is repeated three times. This repetition feels self-conscious, pulling attention to the author's coinage and slightly diminishing the story's otherwise effortless grace. Without this loop, the score would be significantly higher.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, poetic, and flawlessly controlled. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is fresh and powerful ("held an empty cup like a question mark," "meteors spelled sentences") without ever feeling overwrought, demonstrating a rare level of line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically sophisticated, with high information density in most lines. However, the final two paragraphs slip into abstract summary, telling the reader about the transformation ("The isolation she had feared had become the ground...") instead of purely showing it through the final concrete actions and images, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is largely beautiful, with evocative imagery and a confident rhythm. However, the prose is marred by distinct textual artifacts: the verbatim repetition of the phrases "calibrated treason" (four times) and "wisely enduring" (three times). These loops read like formulaic insertions that break the narrative spell and feel like an unpolished draft, preventing an otherwise excellent piece from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, a high-risk style that succeeds due to its consistency and control. Lines like "Starlight dripped like molten glass" and "grief could be sculpted" create a powerful, immersive atmosphere. While bordering on overwrought, the language avoids muddle and propels the narrative forward with a dreamlike momentum. The sentence structure varies effectively, culminating in a final paragraph that provides a perfect, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is incredibly dense and poetic, with nearly every sentence layered with figurative language that builds a powerful, immersive atmosphere. While this style risks becoming overwritten, it is executed with such control and consistency that it becomes a core strength. A few metaphors, like smoke coiling into "paragraphs of remembered minutes," push conceptual boundaries but ultimately serve the story's lyrical, non-literal mode without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous, with a consistent rhythm and high information density where nearly every line contributes to atmosphere and theme. The figurative language is precise and evocative ("banners snapped like gulls," "sound threading through the damp air like silver wire"). The single notable flaw is the repetition of the phrase "scintillatingly somber," which appears twice; using such a distinctive and high-register phrase a second time feels like a minor authorial tic that slightly diminishes its impact and disrupts the otherwise flawless surface of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, syntactic variety, and evocative, precise language. Figurative language is strong and integrated ("cynical monuments," "papers scattered like spoor") without ever feeling overwritten. The prose is clean, propulsive, and entirely free of artifacts, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional information density and rhythmic control, with each sentence advancing the story's texture and momentum. Figurative language is not an adornment but the core mechanism of the storytelling, consistently creating vivid, novel images ("a bell forged of glacier ice," "a nest built by mathematicians who had read too much poetry"). The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or any line-level artifacts, showcasing a masterful and polished craft.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is characterized by its high density of fresh, resonant figurative language, which is deployed with remarkable control and consistency. While this density borders on overwrought, it ultimately succeeds, creating a lush and immersive texture without tripping into mixed metaphors or obscurity. The sentences have a clear propulsive rhythm, varying in structure to match the pace of the poet's ritual, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, a recurring syntactic template for similes ("[noun] [verb] like [poetic image]") creates a noticeable pattern that slightly diminishes the otherwise stellar line-level craft. This minor artifact is the only element holding the prose back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, startlingly original metaphors, and a strong, varied rhythm. Lines like "The sound was restrained wildness: thunder wearing mittens" and spray beading "like slow applause" are both beautiful and functionally precise. The writing is almost entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy; every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the accumulative pressure. This is line-level craft of the highest order.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with striking images like "sever the controlling influence of fear." However, the repeated use of "watchfully calm" and "empirical observation," while clearly intentional as a motif to track Maya's psychological state, borders on becoming a stylistic tic that calls attention to itself. While it serves a purpose, a slight variation in phrasing could have achieved the same effect with more subtlety, preventing the repetition from momentarily breaking the immersive flow.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are constructed with clear purpose and rhythm. There is, however, a tendency towards high figurative density that can feel overwrought at moments, such as the sky splitting "exactly as Ms. Vale predicted." While effective, a lighter touch would have increased the power of key images.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic precision in every sentence. Figurative language is not ornamental but fundamental to the world's logic ("cogs chewing the acid sea's sour foam"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold; the piece is a masterclass in concision and line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density in every line. Figurative language, such as the dark mass that "swallowed starlight like a throat," is vivid and purposeful, never ornamental. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; the momentum is controlled and propulsive. The final incomplete sentence is a daring and effective craft choice that enhances the story's sense of unresolved, continuing mission.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, precise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and striking imagery ("grief smooth, anger jagged, hope thin as blown glass"). There is a high degree of information density in each line without feeling overwritten. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm. The piece is nearly flawless, though the sheer richness of the figurative language walks a fine line, just avoiding self-consciousness.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density and startlingly original figurative language ("drift-ice marina creaked like an old accordion," "floes against the pilings like slow white artillery"). There is zero scaffolding, redundancy, or overwriting. The syntax varies to create a compelling rhythm, and the word choice is consistently surprising and precise. This is prose of immediate, publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished and evocative, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. The figurative language is exceptionally dense, a high-risk style that could feel overwritten but here functions as the core of the story's accumulative drive. Each sentence works to advance atmosphere and character, and there are no discernible loops or filler. The execution is nearly flawless, with only the sheer weight of metaphor preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and striking imagery. However, the sheer density of figurative language in almost every sentence occasionally risks becoming overwrought, slightly dulling the impact of individual metaphors. While the rhythm is controlled, a touch more restraint in key moments could sharpen the focus and lend even greater power to the strongest images.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and rich with figurative language. The sentences are crafted with care, and the overall effect is highly atmospheric. At times, however, the density of similes and metaphors becomes relentless, verging on overwriting and slightly diminishing the impact of individual images through saturation (e.g., "lavender's earnest whimsy").

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with high information density in every line. Figurative language ("pale blade of light," "shawl of cobwebs") is consistently inventive and serves to build the story's specific atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The syntax varies to control rhythm, moving from quiet observation to the ringing clarity of the climax with precision and power. There are no discernible loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both lyrical beauty and concise momentum. Figurative language is dense but never feels overwritten, as each metaphor—like the sky being "an old tape stretched and warped"—deepens the story's established world logic. The sentences are rhythmically varied, information-dense, and free of scaffolding or redundancy, propelling the narrative forward with an almost hypnotic grace.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic precision on every line. Figurative language is consistently original and resonant ("dust drifted from the rafters like inverted snow," "Earthlight pooled like spilled milk"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance the story's textural and emotional progression. The read-aloud quality is exceptional, a testament to meticulous line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is dense, lyrical, and precise, with every sentence contributing to atmosphere, character, or momentum. Figurative language is fresh and integrated (“like black snow,” “a secret smile”). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the information density is high and the propulsion is steady. The piece is a masterclass in using elevated, poetic prose that still serves a clear narrative function without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is consistently elegant and information-dense, with striking and original imagery ("starlight like spilled mercury," "chalk ground from meteorite bone"). The sentence structure varies to match the pace of Elara’s discovery, maintaining strong forward momentum. While the language is highly figurative, it rarely feels overwritten, as the metaphors are coherent and serve to build the story's specific, mythic atmosphere. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible scaffolding, text loops, or syntactic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is generally excellent, marked by high information density and memorable, specific phrasing like "a language that tasted like forgiveness." The rhythm and syntax are varied and support the story's momentum. A minor flaw appears in the climactic dialogue, which feels slightly redundant and risks summarizing the theme, a small patch of telling in an otherwise well-shown narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, marked by strong verbs, specific imagery, and a controlled, rhythmic cadence. Figurative language, such as the pearl being "a moon fallen to earth," is both beautiful and functional. The piece maintains high information density without feeling rushed or overwritten, and it is free of repetitive loops or scaffolding. The line-level craft is exceptional, creating a seamless and evocative reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and dense with purposeful imagery. However, a few minor artifacts prevent a higher score. There is a slight tendency toward a template cadence with sentences structured around a main clause followed by a participial phrase. The repetition of phrases like "honeyed hush" and "protected vulnerability" feels like a faint echo of scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional command of figurative language. Nearly every sentence serves multiple functions, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. The repetition of the phrase "lucidly watchful" is a slight risk but functions as a deliberate, successful motif linking the protagonist to her creations rather than a prose artifact. There are no loops or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and highly crafted, with high information density and precise, evocative imagery ("the harvest moon slipped lower, a coin sliding into an unseen slot"). Figurative language is rich but remains coherent and purposeful, enhancing the atmosphere without becoming overwritten. The piece is nearly flawless at the line level, with only the final sentence feeling slightly more like a summary than a continuation of the poetic mode.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished and poetic, with high information density and striking, original metaphors. The rhythm of the sentences supports the deliberate pacing of the ritual. The repetition of the phrase "demonstrating patience physically" works as a successful, purposeful refrain in this context, reinforcing the core mechanic of the story's magic rather than reading as a prose artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. The figurative language, such as the mechanism being "like a bird that had forgotten how to fly," is often stunning. However, the sheer density approaches overwriting in places, and the repeated use of "peripherally" borders on a tic. While the style is intentional and effective, a slightly more restrained hand could have heightened its power even further without sacrificing tone.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional control, balancing dense, figurative language with crystalline clarity, even at moments of peak intensity. Every sentence serves a purpose, advancing the ritualistic atmosphere and the character’s internal state without a single wasted word or clichéd image. Phrases like "shingled hush" and "whalebone reverie" are not mere decoration but integral parts of the story's unique texture and logic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, imagistic, and rhythmically sophisticated, demonstrating high-level craft on nearly every line. Information density is excellent, with few wasted words. The only minor flaw is a tendency toward such a high concentration of figurative language that it occasionally borders on overwhelming the action it describes.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. While rich with figurative language, it avoids feeling overwritten because each image serves the story’s accumulative pressure and thematic depth. The sentences are rhythmically varied and propulsive, carrying the narrative forward with a dreamlike momentum. There are no discernible loops, scaffolding, or prose artifacts; it is a clean and confident piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with a strong, varied rhythm. However, it suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that, while evocative, occasionally feels overworked and verges on obscuring the action. Some phrases, like "circulate memory instead of chill," are conceptually strained, and this tendency toward overwriting prevents the otherwise strong line-level craft from achieving the highest tier of clarity and concision.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=3.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from a critical flaw: the story ends on an incomplete sentence fragment. This catastrophic error makes the work feel like an unedited draft and completely undermines the final moments. Minor repetitions of "excruciatingly gentle" and "petrichor nostalgia" also slightly dull the otherwise strong line-level craft, but the truncated ending is the primary issue.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with a strong internal rhythm. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, such as the water "tensioned like a drum." While a few phrases like "serene upheaval" lean toward abstraction, they remain within the story's established lyrical register and do not impede momentum. The line-level craft is free of clutter, loops, or other artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished at the line level, with strong verbs and specific, sensory imagery. The rhythm of the sentences effectively carries the story's hushed, patient tone. While the high density of figurative language ("lightning kissed sand and made it cry") occasionally verges on sentimental, it overwhelmingly succeeds in building a coherent and immersive world without loops or distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exquisite, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control in every line. Figurative language is consistently inventive and coherent, creating a rich and immersive texture. The piece is nearly flawless at the line level, with only a single phrase (“understanding the geography of healing required...”) briefly slipping into an analytical register that slightly jars with the otherwise seamless poetic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is rich and precise, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, such as "clockwork cranes stitch copper vines," creating a vivid and coherent world. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and varied, driving momentum effectively toward the swift, impactful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density, rhythmic control, and originality in its figurative language. Every simile and metaphor, from "clouds like drifting kelp" to laughter "like water striking hot stone," feels both surprising and inevitable, deepening the story's elemental atmosphere. The piece is free of loops or artifacts, and the final fragmented sentence is a daring and effective stylistic choice that enhances the ending's power.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the prose is often beautiful and inventive ("constellation of loss," "jealous guardians of drought"), there are moments of overwriting where figurative language feels stacked. The most significant issue is the awkward, unfinished final sentence fragment, which disrupts the rhythmic closure established in the preceding lines and ends the story on a moment of confusion rather than resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the final paragraphs, especially the second-to-last, shift from showing to telling, summarizing the thematic promise rather than letting the images complete the work. This direct explanation stalls the momentum built by the preceding lyrical action and feels like a scaffold left in place, slightly dulling the impact of the otherwise exquisite craft.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density and striking, original imagery ("monarchs...brushed her cheeks like warm ash," "stars appeared like chisel marks in the dark"). Sentence and paragraph structure vary to create a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the fable-like narrative. The writing is clean, evocative, and free of distracting artifacts, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both precision and evocative power. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing character, setting, and theme with high information density (e.g., "her boots finding purchase between the runes of salt"). Figurative language is fresh and thematically integrated, such as the town's lights resembling "scattered gear teeth." The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or any other artifacts that would impede its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.9)
    The line-level craft is virtually perfect. The prose is dense with meaning, rhythmically beautiful, and free of any scaffolding, loops, or overwritten passages. Figurative language, such as stars "stitched into velveteen gloom" or the silo seeming to "inhale," is both original and perfectly suited to the atmosphere. Every sentence advances the story's purpose with an exceptional economy of language.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, confident, and almost entirely free of artifacts. Sentences are constructed with high information density and a strong, varied rhythm. The writing is exceptionally clear and evocative. A minor deduction is made for a few phrases ("the way roots teach soil") that lean towards common literary constructions, slightly softening the otherwise sharp and unique texture of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is consistently inventive and effective, such as the radio dial casting "submarine light" or illuminating the alcove "like sunrise trapped in jade." The rhythm is controlled and purposeful, building momentum toward the crescendo of the dust-orchestra and settling into a quiet cadence for the conclusion. There are no wasted words or weak constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly figurative, operating at a very high level of craft. While walking a fine line, it avoids becoming overwritten by ensuring its complex metaphors serve the central emotional arc. Sentences are rhythmically varied and carry high information density. There are no notable scaffold phrases, loops, or clarity-damaging artifacts; the complexity is controlled and purposeful, contributing to the story's somber, incantatory feel.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with high information density and exquisite rhythm. Lines like "a metronome for ships that would never sail again" and "Their order was a grid nailed over coral, sharp and dead" demonstrate a masterful command of language. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought metaphors; every sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere, character, and ideas with clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with a varied sentence rhythm that supports the story's meditative pace. Information density is high, with most sentences serving character and atmosphere simultaneously. The primary weakness is a tendency towards overwriting; the density of figurative language is so high ("velvet library," "spilled honey," "barbed seed," "fraying like silk") that it occasionally risks feeling overwrought, slightly dulling the impact of individual images through saturation.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative figurative language. However, the repeated phrase "through synaptic plasticity" is a jarring register drift, introducing a clinical, scientific term into an otherwise mystical narrative. This artifact, appearing in the final third, feels inorganic and slightly undermines the integrity of the established voice, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is often beautiful, but marred by a critical logic flaw in the final act: "She struck another match from the cryptic box, though it was now empty." This contradiction breaks the established magic and reader trust at a crucial moment. Additionally, some phrases lean towards overwriting ("wings writing poems of light"), and the story occasionally summarizes emotional shifts rather than embodying them in a single, concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, precise, and demonstrates exceptional control. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, such as a silence "so complete it felt like listening to the origin of listening." The piece is free of scaffolding or redundancy; every sentence carries weight, advancing the story's mood and meaning. The rhythm is hypnotic, mirroring the tidal setting and the protagonist's steady footfalls, creating a work of high polish and artistry.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density and striking imagery. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable artifacts. The repetition of "Cascading revelation" and "Another revelation cascades" acts as a conceptual loop that slightly dulls momentum. The extremely high density of figurative language, while often effective, verges on overwriting in places, creating a texture that is more ornate than propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and demonstrates exceptional control, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. The figurative language, such as steps exhaling "the dust of erased proofs," is consistently inventive and purposeful. While the style verges on being overwritten, it remains just on the side of brilliance because it is so deeply tied to the narrator's voice. The final, long sentence is a rhythmic triumph that lands with immense power.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently luminous, showcasing high information density and fresh, evocative figurative language that is precise and powerful. The sentence-level craft propels the narrative with a varied and musical rhythm. The piece would be near-perfect but for the glaring technical flaw of the final, incomplete sentence, which abruptly breaks the established craft and undermines the story's otherwise polished finish.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is impeccable, marked by high informational density, syntactic variety, and fresh, coherent figurative language ("dialects clashing like cracked bells"). The prose is polished and propulsive, with no overwriting, scaffolding, or rhythmic monotony. This is exceptional writing that demonstrates a mastery of language in service of story.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, precise, and highly evocative, with virtually no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language, such as the beam that "flickers like a match reconsidering itself," is consistently fresh and purposeful. The sentence structure is varied, propelling the narrative forward while building a thick, palpable atmosphere. The read-aloud quality is superb, showing a keen ear for rhythm and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, creating a potent, dreamlike atmosphere that suits the material. Sentence structure is varied, and the rhythm propels the narrative forward effectively. While the repetition of "lingering luminance" works as a successful motif, the final paragraphs contain thematic statements that read more like authorial summary than in-world prose, slightly dulling the sharpness of the closing images.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking, original imagery ("clouds moved in slow braids," "a sound like sunrise forced through a keyhole"). The language is consistently elevated yet precise, avoiding overwriting by ensuring each metaphor serves the story's musical logic. The only minor weakness is in the final two paragraphs, where the momentum shifts slightly from showing to summarizing the character's state and philosophy, a small departure from the otherwise impeccable scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely masterful, with precise imagery ("flakes of iron falling like red snow") and strong rhythmic control. However, the story concludes with the word "a," an ungrammatical fragment that cuts off the final sentence. This is a critical line-level error that severely damages the clarity and resonance of the closing image, constituting a major flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong figurative language and no significant artifacts, though the final sentence is slightly less rhythmically taut than the preceding text.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and propulsive. While rich with figurative language, it never feels overwritten; each metaphor ("scattered commas," "a sigh of silt") serves to make the intangible concept of "absence" felt and seen. The sentences are beautifully constructed with varied rhythms, and there are no wasted words or redundant phrases. This is line-level craft of the highest order, creating a texture that is inseparable from the story's meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language, such as stillness settling "like silt" or the stamp drawing light "the way tide draws moon," is both beautiful and functional, advancing understanding without slowing momentum. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold; every sentence contributes to character, plot, or atmosphere. The piece is a model of clarity and concision, demonstrating complete line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentence structures vary to create a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the ritual. While the figurative language is exceptionally rich, its sheer density occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly slowing momentum in a few key moments. Overall, however, the line-level craft is of a very high caliber, with no redundancy or cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, muscular, and highly figurative, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. While the style is relentlessly elevated, it avoids true overwriting by maintaining conceptual clarity and momentum. The deliberate repetition of key phrases (“intangibly tangible,” “bleak exhilaration”) functions as a powerful leitmotif rather than a loop. The line-level craft is precise and propulsive, culminating in a final paragraph that is both beautiful and devastatingly clear.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is the story’s crowning achievement, exhibiting high information density, rhythmic control, and consistently fresh, powerful imagery ("shadows pooled like ink," "twilight solder the edges," "rotors whispering like turning pages"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. Every sentence serves to advance the narrative and deepen the atmosphere, resulting in a piece that is both elegant and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates high craft, with strong verbs and dense, resonant imagery. However, there are moments where the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought, such as the conceptual explanation "a hush that was not absence of sound but absence of absolution," which briefly stalls momentum. While largely excellent, a few lines could be sharpened for greater concision and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating immaculate rhythm, concision, and information density. Figurative language is consistently original and resonant (e.g., "the moon was a filed coin," "armor creaking like old ice"). There are no wasted words or repetitive structures; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere. The final line, with its blend of "burnt cloth and wet ink," is a perfect, evocative cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong verbs and striking images like the lights as "rosary beads." However, the figurative language is occasionally over-stacked, creating moments where the prose calls attention to its own lyricism at the expense of momentum (e.g., "flickering faith flaring like the bioluminescence"). While the overall quality is very high, this tendency toward overwriting in key beats prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is impeccable, and figurative language is consistently fresh and integrated (“reading between the lines the way an archaeologist reads dust”). The piece demonstrates exceptional line-level craft with no loops or redundancies. A minor, almost imperceptible pattern of similes in the opening paragraphs is the only hairline imperfection in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and dense with powerful, coherent metaphors ("air itself became a loom," "claws of obsidian moonlight"). Sentence structure and rhythm are controlled to match the ritualistic pace. The only minor weakness is the final line, which functions more as summary than evocative image, a slight departure from the "show, don't tell" excellence of the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally precise. Figurative language is not an adornment but the primary mode of conveying information and emotion, achieving remarkable density without feeling overwritten ("a scream catches silence," "cloudbound repentance tasted like iron and lavender"). The rhythm is controlled, sentences are varied, and there are no instances of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts that would dilute momentum. The final lines are particularly powerful, bringing the story's themes to a close with clarity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and striking metaphors ("creaked like an old violin," "a sail of ghosts"). However, two prose artifacts slightly mar the execution. Echo’s two lines of dialogue ("sealed by the shadow we refuse to see" and "locked by the weight of what we buried") are a paraphrase loop, and the phrase "shadow work" reads like a register drift into psychological jargon.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the prose is often beautiful, a significant craft issue occurs with the authorial intrusion: "She did not know that this act orchestrated coincidences...". This sentence breaks the established limited point of view to provide thematic exposition, a flaw that disrupts narrative immersion. The figurative language is also extremely dense, occasionally verging on overwritten.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive.

The prose is rich with fresh, precise imagery ("aurora... shimmered like a borrowed dawn," "dust drifting down like warm snow") yet never feels overwritten, maintaining clarity and propulsion through to the powerful final line. There are zero technical artifacts or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense, precise, and highly polished, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs to advance atmosphere, character, and action. The figurative language is the story's lifeblood, consistently original and integrated ("the ink a crude suture over a wound that refused to close"). While intensely lyrical, the writing avoids becoming overwrought, maintaining clarity and propulsion through its controlled rhythm and sharp, concrete imagery. There are no wasted words or text artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—dense, lyrical, and precise, with no overwriting or wasted words.

The rhythm and syntax are controlled and varied, driving momentum without a single loop, scaffold, or clunky phrase, particularly in the resonant final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and immaculately controlled. Figurative language is not an adornment but the primary mode of communication, as seen in lines like "sirens braided with night birds" and "dawn bruised the horizon." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold; every sentence serves to advance the atmosphere or the quiet plot. The high density of metaphor is a deliberate stylistic choice that the story sustains without stumbling into mixed imagery or incoherence, resulting in a piece that is polished to a high literary sheen.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, yet it maintains clarity and momentum, even during the climax. Each sentence is purposeful, contributing to character, atmosphere, or action without a single wasted word or looped phrase. The elevated language feels earned and consistent, creating a rich texture that is integral to the story's effect rather than being merely decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: lyrical, precise, and dense with meaning. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful, never ornamental. There are no wasted words or scaffold phrases; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere. The final line, with its deliberately unfinished word, is a superb and confident piece of line-level craft that seals the story's theme.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every line serving character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense, especially in the opening paragraphs, that it borders on being overwrought ("wind rocking the pines like a mother rocking grief to sleep"). While the quality is exceptionally high and serves the accumulative structure, a slightly more restrained hand in moments could have heightened the impact of the most powerful images.

    Zero loops and high density until the climax’s "irreverent awe of creation smelling like burnt hope"—abstract phrasing in a peak beat triggers -0.4 for figurative muddle, dulling the closure image’s concrete propulsion despite otherwise masterful line craft.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero closure artifacts; high density in "pixel dimensions of a corrupted image, again in the temperature readout" advances plot. Minor paraphrase loop ("again... again...") in number recurrence avoids scaffold penalty by pattern-teaching, but "felt like breadcrumbs" slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops; every line propels: "frost retreated from their edges" shows emotional shift without telling. Figurative language serves pressure—"light pooling on the ice like melted stars" recharges the fragment’s journey. Final line’s "shifting ice floes that no longer threatened" avoids closure muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "droplets clung to the lace, shimmering with reflection of emergency lights" does triple duty (image, sound, theme). Minor scaffolding in "Mara’s mind still gripped reality loosely" semicolon clause risks abstraction. Zero closure artifacts; final line’s "broken mast" crystallizes earned action.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero scaffold in closure beat, but "algebra of love" metaphor clashes with viticulture lexicon in memory flashback, causing minor coherence drift (-0.3). High density maintained except for redundant "leaves... wine" and "autumn promises" proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose avoids scaffold but risks density: "blue sigils in the air, a living barrier against erosion and the voices that carried memory away" compresses function and theme efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion ("breadcrumb hovered, then drifted west"). "Defiant hush" refrain is taught early and pays off, but "sidereal patience" appears 3x with minimal variation, approaching template cadence in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero scaffold loops with high density, yet "sonar pinging" metaphor recurs with slight muddle (memory vs. nebula hush); final line’s abrupt cutoff ("the light") risks closure ambiguity despite intentional lyric compression.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold; lines like "pollen drifted like pale snow" advance atmosphere and theme. Near-loop on "thundering calm" (3x) feels intentional as motif, but the "weeks" transition risks slight momentum drag. Final line’s rhythm ("listening for the next thundering calm") flawlessly recharges the motif without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold in climax beats, but "velveteen gloom" repeats 3x without deepening meaning (mild synonym churn), and "tenderly organized like the first move" feels slightly forced in final line.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.7)
    "Groundedly imaginative" edges toward abstraction but saved by "refusing easy miracle" action. Otherwise pristine: "scratching frost into frost" compresses physics/effort, zero loops. Final line’s "singing lake" avoids cliché through tactile creaking.
