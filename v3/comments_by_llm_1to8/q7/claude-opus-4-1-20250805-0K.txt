  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=5.4)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "decay is not drama. It is instruction" restates the prior paragraph's point; "profound change happens: quietly, inevitably, and entirely without theatrics" redundantly emphasizes what's been shown. Template cadence appears in "She noticed... She began... She established..." sequences. The final paragraph contains explicit theme statements that replace scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition of "transformation" concept and some abstract phrasing ("drifting resonance," "ancient voice") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("frost patterns that seemed to pulse with unheard rhythms"). However, several passages contain near-paraphrase loops ("music that could be seen and felt"/"music existed beyond sound") and abstract emotional labels ("longing," "joy") that could be more embodied. The filter-verb density in reflection passages slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in peak beats: "bubble of breathable grief—the accumulated sorrow of everyone he'd ever laid to rest" exemplifies the density problem. Multiple conceptual abstractions cluster without grounding ("impossible spaces between water molecules"), and figurative language appears in most sentences during the descent sequence. The final paragraph contains effective rhythm, but middle sections bog down in ornate description that obscures rather than clarifies action.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm, particularly strong in "The bell fell silent, but its echo lived on in every heartbeat below." Several instances of abstract phrasing ("survival required more than just endurance") and mild redundancy ("unified silence" after showing silence) create drag. Information density is generally good but occasionally lapses into summary.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("prayer written in stone," "compressed starlight and forgotten promises"), though some abstract phrases weaken precision ("foggy lucidity," "spiritually curious"). Minor redundancy in explaining the camera's purpose twice, but strong propulsion through varied sentence structures and the final paragraph's rhythmic acceleration.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs (the bridges simultaneously setting, metaphor, and mechanism), though register drift appears in phrases like "retrocognitive imprisonment" and "hyperbolic geometry" that clash with the otherwise organic voice. Some paraphrase loops occur around time's texture being crystalline/granular/sharp-edged, and filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy ("she'd come to understand").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation, though some sentences edge toward overwriting ("singing against the concrete floor"). Information density high in seed descriptions and escape sequence. Minor template patterns in structure ("From the giant stuffed elephant... From the ring toss games...") and occasional abstract phrasing ("weight of possibility") without full dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("apple trees swayed...like drowning hands" combines setting, loss, and reaching). Strong rhythmic variation and syntactic variety. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("found her peace") and one instance of elevated diction slightly outside POV lexicon ("symphony of absence").

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Deduction for the slight conceptual loop between "portrait thief" and later clarification that she doesn't actually steal but reveals, and for occasional elevated diction ("unrepeatable golden light") that borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that mirrors Marina's methodical work. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Some metaphorical language edges toward overwriting ("terrible purpose," "captured suns") but generally serves the accumulative texture. Minor repetition in "Marina + verb" constructions doesn't reach template cadence levels.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("decades of rain had eaten through steel and ambition"). Some density issues with figurative language clustering in emotional beats. Template cadence appears in "Marcus wasn't Marcus. He wasn't even human" structure. Information density high when describing the reversal sequence, though the mechanism could be clearer without sacrificing atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of striking beauty ("caught in an ambered hush that had settled over her consciousness like resin preserving a moment forever") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "hush" variants and some abstract passages about "summarizing silence" that could be more concrete. Information density is high when describing her cataloguing work but occasionally loops in philosophical sections.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the multi-timeline perception sequence. However, abstract philosophical phrasing ("consciousness was merely the universe's janitorial service," "the question endlessly asked across all possible timelines") creates density issues in peak beats, and some repetitive structures ("had once been vapor, that had once been rain") feel templated rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("weighted with what remained unspoken"/"silence into something almost musical" near "resonant hush"). Template phrases like "relief that flooded through her" and abstract emotional labeling reduce immediacy. The recurring "ambiguously clear" works as pattern but other repetitions feel redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("gnarled fingers trailing along hedgerows that whispered secrets"). Some filter verb accumulation ("she felt," "she'd muttered") creates minor drag without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and technical specificity without overwriting. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The lever locked into position with a soft click" simultaneously shows action completion, sound detail, and transition), though occasional filter constructions ("she could see") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("trembling reflection," "liminal space"). Minor template issues: "Marcus had heard...How she'd...How musicians still..." Information density is solid but could be tighter in the middle exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of elevated diction strain in peak moments ("electromagnetic sorrow," "constellation of impossible flowers"), and some repetitive phrasing around "truth" and "margins." The final paragraph's extended metaphor about weight, while thematically resonant, slightly over-explains. No major clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. "The tunnel exhaled behind him" provides evocative closure imagery. Some figurative density in places ("like DNA strands," "metal tombstones") without full payoff. Minor template cadence in the middle radio confession sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Vines had long ago claimed the shelves, weaving through volumes whose pages had transformed into soil." However, abstract philosophical passages ("chronicle she kept was not written but lived, not preserved but perpetually transformed") create mild momentum drag. Some repetitive structures appear ("She had learned...She would...She never") without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of "ordinary magic" as a taught pattern. However, abstract passages dilute momentum ("creating an underground symphony only mothers could hear," "pocket of eternity"), and some sentences loop concepts ("faithful tending of wonder across years of ordinary days").

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression create momentum, with lines like "The world had gone bronze-quiet" doing multiple jobs efficiently. Some abstract passages ("sliding of reality's centerline that occurred in cycles too vast") and mild repetition of "bronze quiet" prevent higher scoring, but no major artifacts touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy ("elaborate pantomime of coincidence," "orchestrated something different"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("fortunes had developed an uncomfortable habit of coming true" followed by similar restatements).

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the loop-building sequences, but some abstract philosophical phrasing ("dimensional anchor," "ordained sequence") occasionally slows momentum. Minor template cadence in the "Marcus + verb" constructions mid-story, though the prose achieves genuine propulsion in the climactic unraveling sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines like "infinite versions of dawn" doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstract phrases ("temporal perception," "vast composition") slightly dilute immediacy. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of spiral/chamber imagery enhance accumulative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but some abstract conceptual language ("periodically eternal," "procedural generation based on her deepest fears") creates occasional opacity. Minor repetition of "fractured timelines" concept without varied embodiment, though the final paragraph achieves strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths matching emotional intensity, though some paraphrase loops appear ("emotional permafrost"/"layers of numbness"/"scar tissue"). Information density high in sensory passages but occasional abstract phrasing ("something deeper—the physical memory") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong information density—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. Some figurative excess appears ("wings cutting through amber light," "currents of revolution") but doesn't overwhelm. Template cadence emerges briefly in the follower paragraph ("stopping when she stopped, breathing when she breathed"). Final sentence effectively reweights earlier elements though "unbreakable" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("tears that weren't solely sorrowful but were portals to preserved worlds") but occasional abstract passages dilute momentum. Some metaphor mixing occurs ("tears...splitting into spectrums that painted memories") though the overall effect remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "impossible choices" appears five times; "texture of time" recurs without evolution. Template phrasing in revelation sequences ("Now he saw..."). The final paragraph contains three restatements of the same thematic point about impossible choices.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("shipwrecks ringed the greenhouse like broken teeth") with strong rhythm variation. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "chronic hush"/"quietude" repetition, and the final three paragraphs restate transformation without added pressure. Template cadence in musician arrival sequence ("A child appeared...Then an old man...They came one by one").

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for some figurative density in places ("pools of liquid gold," "burgundy spread") and one instance of abstract phrasing ("affectionate detachment") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "The outdoor concert had drawn half the port town, but she'd watched from her window" establishes character, setting, and isolation simultaneously. Some paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "cycles of compassion"/"eternal exchange" and the explanation of Samuel's work gets restated. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs despite these redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("tears that caught the lantern light like fallen stars") with good variation in sentence structure. However, several phrases edge toward purple prose ("glimmering obsidian arbor," "wordless melody") and the final sentence runs long without clear propulsion. Some template phrasing around "grandmothers leaning on teenagers."

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several filter verb stacks ("Marina knew," "Marina understood," "Marina felt") and some paraphrase loops around the extinction concept. The phrase "borrowed time" appears frequently without variation. Strong opening and closing lines that frame the narrative arc effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery like "stalactites dripping mineral water." Some abstract passages ("emotion operated on different mathematics") and repetitive constructions around "mathematics of emotion" create minor density issues without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied syntax and selective detail. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some elevated diction ("ferromagnetic," "constellation of memory") fits the archival context. Minor repetition of "careful/carefully" and template structure in the gifts paragraph slightly dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose generally clean but suffers from occasional overwriting ("meandering way," "circuitous sincerity") and some filter-verb clustering mid-story. Information density varies; the middle section has some redundant observation. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("silver veins where fresh water had carved miniature canyons"). However, several ornamental phrases don't advance pressure ("Atlantic pulled back its skirts," "bled its oceans dry"). Minor repetition in water/rain imagery without always adding new weight. The "terrible, necessary art of continuing" feels slightly overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with vivid sensory work, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "bright darkness" concept is restated multiple times, and the final three paragraphs repeatedly explain Vera's transformation rather than embodying it. Template phrasing appears in "She could sense... She felt... understood that..." sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "brass mouths that had once proclaimed arrivals and departures." Some abstract phrasing loops around "fragments into meaning" concept without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle catalog sections ("Morning showed... Noon exposed... Evening brought") though it serves the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("church bells struck three," "intersection of Meridian and Nowhere"). Information density high in opening and closing. Some overwriting in the fortress description with elevated diction ("painful clarity," "paradoxical architecture"). Template cadence appears briefly ("She understood now...She had found...she would return").

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. However, abstract phrasing appears in clusters ("correlation without causation," "linear explanation," "predetermined shapes") and some metaphors stretch thin ("sculpting absence"). The final paragraph contains multiple conceptual abstractions that slightly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("light bent into impossible colors," "swimmers through heavy water"). Information density is good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some repetitive phrasing around "dimensional" concepts and occasional overwriting ("sheets of electromagnetic fury"). The final paragraph's rhythm effectively builds to closure despite minor redundancy in "beyond forever."]

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "working restoration cream into her father's weathered hands" simultaneously advances action, reveals character, and builds metaphor. Minor repetition of "mathematics" and some filter constructions ("Maya didn't flinch") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose generally maintains momentum with purposeful density, though some metaphorical reaches strain ("valley's throat," "manuscript written in living wood"). Information density is high—most sentences advance both the physical action and conceptual framework. Minor repetition around "frequencies" and "histories" could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Effective variation in sentence structure and paragraph length creating tidal rhythm. Some elevated diction ("gossamer," "congregration") slightly strains in places but serves the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Some overwrought phrases appear ("dying moths," "white as sea foam") and the metaphor density occasionally peaks high ("echo chamber" in an already metaphor-rich ending). Information density is strong—most lines advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Minor template patterns in dialogue tags.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some template cadence appears ("Maya watched...Maya stood...Maya began"). Minor paraphrase loop with "reorganize" concept stated then restated. Information density strong in graffiti translations but occasional abstraction ("painful clarity," "hopeful desperation") reduces specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Several instances of elevated diction ("dawnlit melancholy," "ethereal tendril") and abstract phrasing ("between what we'd dreamed and what we'd settled for") that could be more concrete. Information density is high but occasionally tips toward overwriting in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful technical detail about the repair process. Some figurative language enriches without overwhelming ("tiny vortexes in the mist that painted aerial patterns"). Deductions for occasional overwriting ("magnetic calm" appears twice) and slightly repetitive sentence structures in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose maintains clarity with purposeful rhythm variations matching discovery beats. Information density high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. Minor deductions for "oddly comforting" (hedging), "seemingly random" (unnecessary qualifier), and one filter verb cluster around "she'd learned to interpret."

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some elegant turns ("ghost town that had learned to live again") and effective rhythm modulation. However, several phrases edge toward purple ("wild hush that falls when a crowd discovers magic") and there's occasional template cadence in the teaching sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("gossamer threads of experience that drifted like jellyfish"). However, several abstract phrases weaken immediacy: "touched memories in ways science couldn't explain," "eternal congregation," "fleeting infinities." Some filter-verb clusters in the middle section ("Maya understood," "felt it," "realized") dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally clean with strong imagery like "hover-carved itself into the wood." Some repetitive structures ("Marcus understood," "Marcus began," "Marcus smiled") create mild template cadence. The "copper light" motif works well. Minor overwriting in places ("defying gravity as casually as logic").

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("fruits pulsed like hearts," "crystalline frost") and good momentum. Some overwriting in metaphor density ("beautiful, venomous love" clusters) and occasional register drift into elevated diction. The final paragraph maintains clarity despite multiple transformations happening simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "barnacles grew on petroglyphs" conveying both environmental fusion and temporal collapse. Some figurative density in peak moments ("needle pierced the air itself, catching invisible threads") and mild repetition of "broken" weakens momentum, though the final image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptive passages that advance both atmosphere and theme. Some figurative density in places ("twisting through gaps in the limestone, their roots embracing skulls") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor paraphrase loop with "cautious enchantment" appearing twice. Clear propulsion through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose maintains strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/theme). Some mild repetition around "chalk" and "symbols" but serves accumulative pattern. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm; paragraphs vary purposefully. Minor filter verb clustering ("could hear," "could see") slightly dulls immediacy in middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally clean prose with good information density and momentum. However, several instances of elevated diction clash with established voice ("cobalt dome...caught autumn's dying light like a bruise"), and some filter-heavy passages in the middle third ("Vera saw more than light," "she carefully extracted"). The scaffold phrase "not recognizing" and similar constructions appear multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with evocative imagery like "moonlight pooled like mercury." Some density issues with figurative language clustering in emotional peaks. Template phrasing appears in "She found... She pressed... She stood" sequences. The transformation paragraph contains slight paraphrase loops around the lifting/transforming concept.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several artifacts damage immediacy: therapy-speak labels ("lotus-hearted ache"), elevated register drift ("collaborative ceremony of translation and transformation"), and some abstract telling ("understanding suddenly"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions mid-story. These artifacts don't touch the closure beat directly but accumulate enough to cap the score.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong momentum and imagery, though some figurative density in peak moments edges toward overwriting ("fold around her like silk," "exposed film developing in reverse"). Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some template cadence in the middle section ("She felt...She understood...She laughed") disrupts rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and rhythmic control during the transformation sequence. Information density high—most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. Deductions for filter-verb clustering ("could feel," "could hear"), one paraphrase loop about choosing differently, and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum. Information density high ("each groove a letter in their evolving alphabet"). Deduction for metaphor density in places ("choreographed dance of trowels and seeds") and one instance of template cadence in the insect release sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("charcoal made from burned poems that hadn't quite worked, each failure becoming material for the next attempt"). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Some figurative density in places ("grenades of beauty that exploded in hearts, leaving shrapnel of longing") occasionally tips toward overwriting. Template phrases like "slowly, shyly, but unstoppably" and some abstract labeling reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for filter-verb clustering ("felt the weight," "felt the foxglove regret"), some elevated diction drift ("carelessly let slip away"), and the abstract "foxglove regret" metaphor that appears twice without clear vehicle logic.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and professional but suffers from template cadence ("Elena's hands trembled," "Elena dipped her pen," "Elena realized," "Elena packed"). The "symphonies of truth" metaphor risks overextension but maintains coherence. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance the story but few do multiple jobs simultaneously. The final paragraph's explicit moralizing ("translations weren't between languages but between hearts") weakens the ending's subtlety.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The volcano had been dormant for three centuries" simultaneously establishes timeline, mirrors community patience, and sets up the power metaphor. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "love must wear the mask of pragmatism"/"hiding care inside apparent strategy" and the redundant water metaphors in the final paragraph. Template cadence appears in "She'd [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages about dust motes and letter-sorting. However, several passages edge toward overwriting ("brittle as autumn leaves," "vast archive of her healing heart") and there's occasional template phrasing in the seasonal transformation sequence. Information density is generally high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with phrases like "corn whispered in fractured hush" and maintains good rhythm variation. However, several abstract formulations weaken immediacy: "sacred geometry of loss and return," "atmospheric pressure of a daughter's love," and repetitive use of "necessary distance" without variation. The filter verb "felt" appears at crucial moments where more direct sensation would strengthen impact.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in descriptive passages like "schools of fish began gathering, their scales catching and reflecting the glow." Some elevated diction ("captivated them both completely," "ascending souls") occasionally interrupts momentum. Line-level craft supports the accumulative structure through careful image layering.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong information density and varied syntax, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("bells wrapped in velvet") and abstract philosophizing that slows momentum. The paraphrase loop about paths disappearing (paragraphs 5-6) creates redundancy. Line-level craft is competent but lacks the precision needed for higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density - most sentences advance multiple elements. Rhythm varies naturally between technical observation and lyrical description. Some filter verb clustering in middle sections ("recognized," "shifted") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful figurative language that supports the mystical tone, particularly in descriptions of the dance and transformation. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("cosmic verse," "living document of defiance") and mild repetition of concept words (memory/remembrance, cosmic/celestial) create minor opacity. The "gaps between" concept in paragraph four, while thematically relevant, borders on over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with purposeful repetition of water/light imagery, though several abstract formulations ("conversation between what was and what could be") and occasional register elevation dilute immediacy. Information density remains high with most sentences advancing both external observation and internal realization.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("moonlight seep through its fractures") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("violent tenderness," "harder and softer than sorrow"). Template cadence appears in the bargain section ("He'd made...," "Every firefighter made..."). Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves clarity with moments of genuine beauty ("where salt air met stone, the boundaries between parallel worlds grew thin"). However, several passages contain explanatory loops ("teaching others how to slip between worlds" restates the invitation concept) and some filter-heavy constructions dilute immediacy. Information density is moderate rather than high.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied rhythm and purposeful information density, particularly in discovery sequences. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "eternal collection" and "green conquest," and there's slight repetition in vegetation descriptions, but clarity remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high—most lines advance both plot and atmosphere. Some figurative density in peak beats ("sweet and golden" taffy metaphor) slightly slows propulsion, and "infinite grace" borders on overwriting, but no loops or scaffolding appear.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("bones singing a minor key") and good sentence variety. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("moving like grief itself," "bleeding corona," "broken music" in close succession) and occasional register drift ("operatively gentle," "certified hatred"). Information density high but moments of figurative pile-up in emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("crystalline crust," "acoustic fossil beds"). Information density high - most lines advance multiple layers. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("archive of absences," "museum of drought") without becoming muddy. Minor template cadence in "She'd [verb]" constructions mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("each flake catching starlight like scattered diamonds"), but occasional overwriting appears: "cada movement a verse in the poem she would write with her freedom" contains a typo and strains the metaphor. Some paraphrase loops exist between "devotion could exist without submission" and similar restatements.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("curved overhead like the skull of some ancient giant") but suffers from abstract telling about Marcus's methods rather than showing them. Several paraphrase loops appear, like the repeated explanations of his narrative reversal technique. Information density is uneven, with some paragraphs restating concepts without advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("orange wings like torn sunset"). Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("creating beauty...creating prisms...creating invisible knots") and some paraphrase loops around impermanence themes. Information density is good but uneven—the middle section about cloud dwellers contains more telling than the embodied opening and closing.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("each strand vibrated with trapped frequencies") but suffers from periodic density issues - figurative language appears in most sentences during discovery beats without always advancing pressure. Template cadence emerges in places ("She'd come... She'd failed... She'd discovered") and some paraphrase loops appear ("memory wasn't about perfect preservation but about transformation" restates earlier insights).

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and evocative imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. Some mild overwriting appears in metaphor clusters ("promise half-forgotten," "tears of iron") and occasional abstract phrasing ("transcending not through escape but through acceptance") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("starlight filtered through calculated gaps") with strong information density. However, abstract phrasing like "knowledge uncloak itself" and "dimensions orthogonal to time" occasionally obscures concrete action. Minor redundancy in describing the palace's function appears across paragraphs 9-11.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several passages suffer from abstract density ("confluence," "metamorphosis," "reconfiguration") and conceptual loops ("cellular memory" appears 7 times). Lines like "reality would shift enough to allow true change" and "teaching our cells to remember peace instead of war" lean heavily on telling over showing, though key moments remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density high—most lines advance multiple story elements. Some elevated diction ("permeable," "nebulae," "resonated") slightly strains the craftsperson POV but doesn't obscure meaning. The "insects in amber" simile and crystalline singing of glass fragments show controlled figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. Deductions for filter verb clusters ("she glimpsed," "she saw"), some template cadence in the middle ("She showed...She gestured...She considered"), and occasional overwriting ("peculiar fruit from silken threads"). Information density is high in most passages but dulled by these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The orchard shouldn't exist either—fruit trees breathing in vacuum"). Some repetitive structures appear ("She would return...She would forget...") though they serve the temporal loop theme. Figurative language occasionally strains ("juice ran silver down her chin like liquid starlight") but generally enhances rather than obscures.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some overwriting appears ("labyrinthine bookstore that had consumed Mount Erebis from within, its corridors spiraling through hollowed rock like the chambers of an ancient heart"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into ornamental metaphor. The "unheard symphony" edges toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery ("rusted calliope pipes singing ghost notes"). Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for abstract philosophy in peak moments ("the greatest discoveries live in the unkindled spaces"), some repetitive phrasing around memory/forgetting, and occasional register elevation that dulls immediacy ("neurological phenomenon Marina had been documenting").

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("filed between the seconds that tick forward and those that don't"). Some abstract phrasing in middle sections ("fables of absence lived") slightly dulls momentum. Minor repetition of "absence/presence" concept without always advancing meaning. Information density is good but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the extraction sequence. However, several paraphrase loops diminish density: "where silence pooled, where sound gathered, where the two met" repeats structure without advancing; "Tomorrow she would return...But tonight" creates unnecessary scaffold that could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong imagery density with lines doing multiple jobs: "rose like dying stars and never returned" combines action, metaphor, and finality. Some figurative density in peak moments ("darkness so profound it illuminated everything") works thematically but occasionally tips toward overwriting. The prose maintains momentum despite lyrical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of "memory/remember" that accumulates meaning. However, several abstract philosophical passages ("conjecture...imagine who we were to sculpt identity") and elevated diction clusters reduce immediacy. The "ancient fire" ending risks cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good, with most lines advancing multiple elements. However, some abstract phrasing ("defiant persistence," "gravity of hopelessness") and mild redundancy in describing the fireworks' effects reduce precision. The chanting effectively creates textural pattern without becoming repetitive.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of elevated diction ("susurration of retreating waves," "microscopic symphonies," "calcium cities") create mild overwriting. Some paraphrase proximity in the pools' description sections. Information density is good but occasional abstraction ("the texture of these transitions") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts during the inversion sequence. Information density is high - most sentences advance story, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("frost made of whispers") and redundancy ("thick, suffocating" bunker silence), plus minor scaffold in explaining the collection purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between action and reflection. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. Some figurative language borders on overwriting ("crystalline spans," "suspended city of glass and silence") and occasional filter phrases ("Marcus knew," "Marcus recognized") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences. However, several overwrought phrases ("wisely adventurous steps," "sailed into the dark rather than bend to tyranny") and minor redundancies ("the throne remained unclaimed...the unclaimed throne") create occasional density without advancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong rhythmic variation and information density, particularly in "shadows who'd learned to breathe darkness like air." However, some conceptual repetition appears ("necessary endings" echoes across paragraphs) and abstract phrasing occasionally dulls immediacy ("loaded emptiness between heartbeats").

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("promises that drifted through the air like snow made of light") with good rhythm variation. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for template phrases ("the irony wasn't lost on her"), some filter verb clusters ("Marina felt," "she'd discovered"), and occasional overwriting in metaphor density that approaches purple prose without quite crossing over.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("Glass shattered in a cascade of golden fragments"), but template constructions appear ("Victoria felt," "She saw," "She could") and some passages paraphrase rather than advance. The final image lands cleanly without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("trees bore fruit of crystallized potential") but occasionally overwrites with abstract compounds. Some redundancy appears ("trembling moment"/"shivering bliss"), though momentum generally sustains through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Foster mother: Helen Martinez, widow, three previous long-term placements" efficiently establishes character and experience). Some repetition of "accumulated/accumulation" and abstract phrasing ("repository of society's most vulnerable histories") creates minor drag. The varied paragraph lengths create good visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation, particularly in action sequences. However, several ornamental phrases add little ("like scattered diamonds," "poorly woven cloth") and some sentences restate without advancing ("The real rebellion hadn't failed—it had just begun" following the already-clear setup). Template constructions appear ("She'd learned...She'd found...") and abstract summaries replace concrete detail in places.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and strong imagery like "fingers danced above the keys without touching." Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. Minor redundancy appears in explaining the non-performance concept multiple times ("not by playing, but by almost playing"), and some abstract phrases like "negative space between intention and action" border on overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though some figurative density in peak moments ("bell made of starlight," "fractals of emerald joy") approaches overwriting. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but phrases like "gravity's rebellious children" edge toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages like "Dead leaves danced in impossible spirals, never settling." Some middle sections contain minor redundancies ("broken and leaving just as useless"), and the phrase "uncertainly certain" appears twice, creating a slight loop effect.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting in figurative language ("caught the light like a constellation of their own making"). Minor template cadence in dialogue tags and some elevated register that creates distance. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story or atmosphere but several could do double duty more efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition ("echoes...echo"). Information density solid with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for elevated diction clusters ("achingly luminous," "marriage of sorrow and joy") and one paraphrase loop ("another soul collected, another confession heard, another healing").

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity and varied rhythm, but some conceptual redundancy around the mathematics metaphor and occasional overwriting ("decimals of her pain"). The paraphrase loop around formulas/equations/mathematics weakens momentum in places without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some elevated diction creates mild register drift ("elusively tangible sense," "infinite moment"). Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and theme. The final paragraph contains slight redundancy in explaining the stories' projection. Strong opening and closing lines anchor the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high in discovery sequences. Deductions for template cadence in ghost descriptions ("a maintenance man, a building manager, an actress"), some filter-verb clustering ("Marcus could still hear," "he'd felt"), and occasional overwriting ("yellow as old teeth").

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "printing editions of one" and "silence so profound that every other whisper strained against their glass prisons." Some abstract phrases ("rustling awakenings," "negotiable reality") appear multiple times without gaining specificity, and filter constructions occasionally slow momentum ("She understood now," "Moth felt").

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with effective variation, but several issues accumulate: redundant phrasing around "failed revolutionary" concept, abstract descriptors ("impossible colors," "unimaginable victories"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("shard caught light like frozen tears, its edges singing"). The final paragraph achieves strong momentum but earlier sections have density issues with concept-repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and sensory specificity. However, several instances of overwriting ("honey while his heart pumped tar"), some repetitive phrasing around "resonance," and occasional purple patches ("wings of a simple repairman's song"). The extended exposition about the Covenant disrupts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("cosmic rain," "folded into limestone like pressed flowers") and occasional abstract phrasing ("broke the boundaries of language") create minor opacity. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments of compression and rhythm, particularly in the carving sequence and storm descriptions. However, several abstract passages create momentum drag ("timewoven alliances," "perpetually learning meant more than accumulating knowledge") and some paraphrase loops appear ("broken or lost"/"fragments into wholeness"). The template phrase "Marina + verb" appears too frequently in the middle section, though the opening and closing paragraphs maintain stronger propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deduction for repetitive abstract phrasing in the final paragraph ("patient as paint drying," "patient as the moon's slow journey") and some template cadence in the closing that creates mild momentum drag without fully obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of resonant imagery ("obsidian lagoon reflected the zeppelin above, creating an infinity of floating libraries") but suffers from abstract scaffolding and conceptual redundancy. Lines like "knowing who is different from understanding why" and variations on truth/tension appear multiple times without advancing pressure, creating paraphrase loops that slow momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong imagery but contains scaffold phrases ("Now he stood," "For hours he stood") and some abstract telling about hope and possibility. The transformation sequence relies on summary rather than moment-by-moment embodiment, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some figurative density in places ("sound like breaking teeth," "vocabulary for hope") but it serves the accumulative design. Minor repetition of "patterns" but it's thematically motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("ice coating the atrium walls began to sublime directly into vapor") but suffers from abstract density in places ("compressed time itself," "localized pockets of spacetime"). Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the inheritance concept being explained multiple ways, and filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy ("she felt," "she understood").

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between technical observation and urgent action. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in consecutive sentences and some scaffolding phrases ("According to mountain tradition," "In her three years of service").

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure, but abstract noun clusters ("flourishing stillness," "primal elegance") and some paraphrase loops weaken precision. The phrase "vulnerability had become their telescope, their stillness a garden where understanding could flourish" approaches purple prose, and several sentences restate similar content about isolation becoming strength.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("The box hummed—not with bees, for they were long extinct—but with something older"). However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("like captured sunset") and repetitive phrasing around "silence/unspoken" create minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("cracked like an egg," "emerald frequency"). Information density high in the garage sale advertisements. Deductions for repetitive "understood" constructions and some abstract phrasing around time's texture that could be more concrete. Minor scaffold in exposition about Voss's plan.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though figurative density occasionally slows the pace ("cobalt lagoon held its breath," "hammered gold," "burnished hush" in close proximity). The final paragraph contains a paraphrase loop where the morning metaphor restates rather than advances. Information density is moderate—some descriptive passages could do more work.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "diagnosis had arrived like salt spray on a windless day." Template cadence appears in the middle section with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. Information density is high when describing the copper network's function, though some passages lean toward exposition ("The trees had been trying to communicate for centuries"). No major clarity issues at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, particularly in the opening and closing images. Information density high in most passages. Deductions for exposition-heavy middle section with some template phrasing ("Marcus nodded toward his screens displaying"), and filter-verb clustering around "Elena studied," "Elena realized," "Elena understood" that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Deductions for occasional overwriting: "viciously fertile" feels forced, "green chaos" is abstract, and some metaphorical density in peak beats ("choir of the extinct," "liquid fertilizer," "calcium embrace") creates mild figurative muddle. The filter-verb stack "had driven...had taught...had witnessed" dulls immediacy in one paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong sensory specificity. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered template constructions ("She couldn't explain how...") and some abstract emotional labeling ("extraordinary," "hammered"). The final howl image achieves strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though some abstract phrasing ("confusion could become exploration") and slight redundancy in the temporal stretching descriptions. The final paragraph contains minor scaffold with "understanding at last" that could trust the dramatization more. Strong rhythm variation supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "the sky writhed in impossible geometries." Some template cadence in middle sections ("She had come...She'd stolen...Her master called") and occasional filter verbs reduce propulsion. The closing image of moving through the world with "cautious abandon" effectively recharges the opening concepts without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments ("where whispers traveled like ghosts of legislation") but suffers from abstract passages and some paraphrase loops ("small gestures"/"microseconds of meaning"). The walking-writing creates propulsion, but middle sections contain scaffolding phrases. Information density varies; some paragraphs could be cut without loss. No major artifacts touch closure, preventing lower score.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("mercury-glass seer," "books formed walls that spiraled upward"). Some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("when remembering became painful," "permission to plant a future"). Minor repetition of "buried talents" without variation. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively mirrors the garden's growth.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean, propulsive prose with strong syntactic variety and information density. Minor issues with occasional elevated register ("monumental proportions," "profound quiet") and one instance of telling over showing ("His disgrace had been swift and thorough"). The metaphorical density serves the accumulative mode without overwhelming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("accusations," "ossuary prison," "flame through dry kindling") without full payoff. Information density is strong—most sentences advance both action and theme. Some abstract phrasing ("truth is not a blade but water") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and concrete imagery, but figurative density in places ("threads of golden light streaming from every crack") and occasional register elevation ("transmuting despair into something eternal") create minor friction. The phrase "dire enchantment" feels forced into the final paragraph rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally propels with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good - most sentences advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("caves yawned like dark mouths"), some filter verb clustering ("Marina realized," "she understood"), and abstract phrasing in emotional passages that could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("vibrations of intent so pure," "gentle violence of refusing"). Template construction appears in emotional descriptions. Information density high in action sequences but some scaffolding in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, particularly in the dialogue sequences. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The array groaned, shifted an inch" showing both success and limitation. Some filter verb clustering appears ("Marina understood," "Marina knew") and "vast indifference" tends toward abstraction, but the closing image lands with concrete power.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("glass eye rolled between Mara's fingers") but suffers from occasional density issues with multiple metaphors per sentence and some register elevation ("blessed silence in her throat"). Template cadence appears in middle exposition about the virus's effects, though line-level craft improves at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and selective detail, particularly in the discovery sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("witnessed isolation," "softly persistent") occasionally strains but serves thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks, with evocative phrases like "topology—the shape of choices not yet made." Some filter verbs ("Marcus understood," "Marcus watched") dull immediacy in transition beats, and "impossible summer light" borders on overwriting without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The path wound through dying gardens where roses bloomed backwards into buds"). Minor repetition of "bleeding starlight" and some elevated diction ("crystalline, sharp") that occasionally distances rather than immerses. The transformation sequence maintains momentum despite abstract elements.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with moments of strong imagery, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("ineffable weight," "density of presence") and mild overwriting in figurative language. "Scientifically romantic in the truest sense: precise in its tenderness" borders on explaining rather than embodying. Some repetitive structures in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variety and information density, particularly in passages like "She'd written these dreams—would write them—had written them." However, some metaphorical density in middle sections ("smoke from a ranger's signal fire, carrying messages") and occasional repetitive constructions ("never quite meet, never quite separate, never quite understand") slightly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Some abstract phrasing ("emotional terrain," "ordinary miracles") and mild repetition of "reading between lines" concept. Information density is good with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in reflection passages.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the held-breath sequence. Information density is high—most lines advance both external test and internal transformation. Some elevated diction ("saturated hush," "fractal branches") fits the scholarly POV but occasionally approaches purple prose territory.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("memory itself, distilled"). Minor template cadence in the middle section. Strong opening and closing lines that anchor voice and recharge earlier motifs. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong images like "words leaked from its pages like smoke," though some passages contain philosophical density that slows momentum ("opposition itself was the illusion that needed unraveling"). Minor template cadence in "She was... She walked... She placed" sequence but rhythm largely varies with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally clean with strong information density, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("fingers that trembled like bird bones"). The counting sequence effectively varies rhythm. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions but not pervasive enough for major deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has moments of beauty but suffers from overwriting in places—"quiet wildfire burning through her," "gossamer membranes." Some paraphrase loops appear ("boundaries/barriers" repetition). Template cadence emerges in the discovery sequence. The metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("burned through her like quiet wildfire, consuming old certainties") obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("feeding quarters to slot machines in the cardiac recovery wing's illegal basement casino"). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections ("Elena recognized," "she'd assumed," "now understood") dulls immediacy. Information density generally high but occasional conceptual loops around probability/chaos reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "would [verb]" constructions in the final paragraph and some filter-verb clustering ("Marcus stood," "Marcus walked") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose occasionally overreaches with stacked modifiers ("haunted and luminous as the twilight itself") and some template phrasing appears ("Mara had sat with this knowledge"). However, key moments achieve strong clarity and the microscopic codicil image lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm—"She'd learned this through seventeen floods, nine earthquakes, and one nuclear meltdown that officially never happened." Information density remains high throughout. Slight deduction for the abstract formulation "purpose tangled up with other people's purposes" in a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though some abstract phrases like "vast territories of what people carried inside" and "quiet blaze of revelation" edge toward purple prose. Minor repetition of "ultrasonic forest" and some synonym cycling around emotional/uncharted/depths. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of abstract telling ("The discovery had started three months ago") and conceptual redundancy around the editing metaphor. Some filter-heavy passages ("she watched," "Mira felt") reduce immediacy. The recursive "editing/revising" language occasionally creates loops.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("The harbor glowed like spilled mercury") with good rhythm variation. However, some redundancy appears ("forgotten melodies could be seen rather than heard" closely echoes earlier concepts) and occasional overwriting ("quietly charismatic presence that drew people without sound—a gravitational pull").

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and strong imagery ("lava cooling into new earth"), though some passages loop conceptually (the repeated emphasis on erasing/destroying in paragraph one). The "volcanic tenderness" motif effectively bookends the piece, but phrases like "systematically erased from history" and "elaborate lies" edge toward generic.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional elevated diction mismatched to context ("confluence where consciousness pooled"), some abstract phrasing in the middle section, and minor repetition of "consciousness" without sufficient variation.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates solid clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("painted green fire across the corrugated walls while compasses spun wildly") and occasional template phrasing ("Marcus had worked... Marcus kept... Marcus pulled out") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though several instances of overwriting appear: "spiralingly calm movements—like water circling a drain in reverse" strains the metaphor. Some redundancy exists between "guardian of the truth that the most profound empathy often speaks without making a sound" and earlier iterations of this theme. The closing sentence runs long without sufficient payoff for its complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose flows well with varied sentence structures and some evocative phrases ("blue stone walls breathing with an ancient pulse"). Information density is generally good, though some passages contain mild redundancy (the library's warnings are mentioned multiple times without advancing). The "forests of second thoughts" metaphor recurs effectively, but phrases like "systematic suppression of strategic thought" and "overthrow of unexamined thoughts" read as abstract scaffolding rather than embodied language.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the transformation sequence. Several instances of elevated diction ("sublittoral fringe," "shimmering," "phosphorescent") create mild register inconsistency. The "authentic souls" phrase in the penultimate paragraph approaches thesis-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves clarity with moments of distinction: "eternal whisper-roar," "remade hush," "hollow it out from inside until it could float." Some template constructions appear ("She had arrived," "She placed," "She continued") and occasional filter verbs reduce immediacy. The ritual narration justifies repetitive structure but doesn't fully escape monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.3)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language ("lantern-moth hush," "living calligraphy") that prioritizes atmosphere over clarity. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the boundary-dissolution concept repeated in various formations without advancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the note hung in the air, pure despite its damaged housing." Some template phrasing appears ("Mira said simply," "Enzo said suddenly") and occasional telling ("calculating eyes"), but momentum remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story or atmosphere. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "lost sounds" concept, some abstract constructions ("texture of connection"), and occasional filter-verb clusters that reduce immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variations, particularly in the accumulation of coordinate locations and the final paragraph's measured cadence. Information density is strong—most sentences advance both external action and internal state. Some figurative density in places ("curtains of intention," "constellation of flames") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor redundancy in explaining the phoenix symbolism ("learning to burn without dying" closely follows "half ash, half flame").

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high with lines like "Each black card revealed another node when she held it under the ultraviolet lamp" doing multiple jobs. The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful technical detail, with only minor redundancy in explaining the forty-three day pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with vivid moments ("saffron veil catching the dying light"), but abstract phrases accumulate ("transformed through unpattern," "transmuting civilization's end into beginning"). Some template constructions appear ("She had trained herself to be," "She understood now why") that could be more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is high, with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. However, template cadence appears in the shadow-tracking sequence ("In the 2024 recording... By 2054... Now Mira understood"), and some phrases edge toward purple ("eternal dusk deepened into colors that had no names"). The modifier "softly deliberate" appears twice, creating minor repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "told myself I was saving you/But I was using your pain" restates without advancement. Template cadence appears in the "She'd built/She'd removed/She'd felt" sequence. Information density could be higher in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The frosted hourglass turned for the last time" establishing both object and finality. Some elevated diction ("irreversible has burned through the atmosphere") occasionally strains, but rhythm varies effectively and no significant loops appear.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative density mostly avoids overwriting ("sleeping snake," "metal teeth"), though some passages edge toward purple ("hushed thunder of her own heartbeat"). Information density high with multi-purpose sentences, but occasional abstract phrasing ("emotional geography") and slight redundancy in the goodbye letter descriptions cost precision.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty: "aurora borealis twisted overhead like liquid emerald." However, abstract phrases like "symphony of unspoken stellar thoughts that revealed the universe's hidden architecture" lack concrete grounding. Some paraphrase loops appear: "remembered stardust" concept restated without advancement. Template cadence in "She felt... She smiled..." sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "probability fog" and "quantum foam." Information density is high - most sentences advance world, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance both literal and metaphorical tracks. Some figurative density in peak moments ("voices braiding together like mist and limestone") occasionally tips toward overwriting but remains coherent. The closing image powerfully synthesizes the journey without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and good momentum. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend the piece effectively. Deductions for some overwriting ("suffocating quiet," "frostbitten hope") and occasional register elevation that doesn't quite match Marcus's bellhop perspective. The phrase "agreement between sound and silence" borders on abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves strong clarity with varied rhythm—short declarations like "Nothing dies here" punctuate longer descriptive passages. Information density stays high throughout. Minor repetition of "false" in the closing paragraph slightly weakens the finale.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of the tapping motif. Some metaphor density in peak moments ("calcium and silence," "language of reef and bone") and minor redundancy around the transformation concept, but momentum remains strong through selective detail.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence length and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror Kira's descent and discovery. Information density high—most sentences advance both external action and internal realization. Some abstract phrasing ("thunderous serenity," "margin of daylight") borders on purple but serves the accumulative texture. Minor repetition of "understanding" and filter constructions ("she felt," "she understood") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for template cadence in exposition ("Through them, she'd discovered... They were rewriting..."), some filter verb clustering ("Chen felt it spreading"), and occasional overwriting ("sulfur-scented mist from the volcanic springs").

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "white orchids everywhere, then white phosphorus, then white sheets." Some filter-verb clustering ("She thought of," "Perhaps he'd understood") and occasional abstraction ("something essential in aligning herself"). The final paragraph's rhythm effectively builds to closure despite minor redundancy in "continue/continuing."

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of sensory precision ("Glass fell upward, tinkling like chimes") alternate with overwritten passages. Template cadence appears in the rhetorical question pattern (five instances of "What/Why/How" questions). Mixed metaphor of walls both "pressing closer" and "opening inward" creates momentary confusion though it ultimately serves the fragmentation theme. Some paraphrase loops around the concept of broken/fragmented reality.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density, though several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy ("that peculiar quality of serene anger she'd cultivated").

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is good with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for overwriting in places ("crystalline warnings," "dizzying quiet"), some repetitive phrasing around temperature/cold, and abstract constructions like "terrible peace" that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She possessed what he called a senseless perception"). Some figurative language approaches oversaturation ("prayer made solid," "quiet blaze"), and occasional template constructions appear ("She didn't merely water them; she taught them"), but momentum remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The rail spike burned now, conducting frequencies that shouldn't exist"). Some metaphor density in peak moments ("prowling cat made of departed music") and minor register elevation, but momentum and clarity remain strong through closure.

The closing image resonates without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally flows with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("meaning wasn't something to preserve but something to discover fresh in each beautiful mess").

Information density is moderate with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the world split open. Not physically—temporally." Some repetitive phrasing around visions ("seized her," "released her") and minor scaffold in exposition passages. "Retrocognitively trapped but finally free" lands effectively. Template cadence in middle vision descriptions.

    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong sensory specificity. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for several instances of abstract phrasing ("possibility's sharp mint," "despair's purple edge") and some repetitive structures around the echo concept that create mild loops.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax, though some abstract phrases like "dendrites of possibility" and "architecture of connection" lean purple. The "willowglass hope" coinage works as character-specific. Deduction for repetitive "hidden pathways" phrasing and some scaffolding around the telepathy explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density good with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in figurative language ("conscious darkness," "strange new dance") and mild template cadence in middle sections ("She drifted... She adjusted... She began"). Final paragraph maintains momentum despite density.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("frozen honey," "pulverized dreams") but suffers from abstract philosophical passages that slow momentum ("understanding that the future was always being written"). Some sentences do multiple jobs effectively, but others loop conceptually without advancing pressure. The final line "In the unearthed silence, everything spoke" provides resonant closure despite occasional overwriting in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose generally clean with strong moments like "The mist rolled across Zephyr Bluff like a living thing." Some repetition of "silver hush" and occasional overwriting ("prudently daring") create minor friction without damaging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in "Layer upon layer of vows made by desperate travelers accumulated here." Some figurative density in middle section ("distilling complexity into essence") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean syntax throughout with purposeful paragraph variation.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"golden with honey and humming with ten thousand wings" simultaneously establishes past state, sensory richness, and thematic resonance. Minor repetition in "patient/patience" cluster could be tightened. Strong syntactic variety supports the meditative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("protected vulnerability," "metaphorical corners") and mild overwriting in figurative density. The "quivering hush" repetition and some elevated diction ("instill") occasionally slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic control in passages like "brittle and sharp three months ago when the ancient stone circle beneath the library began its eternal hum." However, abstract phrasing clusters in places ("extinct wisdom," "paradox," "anachronisms") and some repetitive constructions around memory and time. The final paragraph contains philosophical abstraction that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("prayer made manifest"). However, some overwriting appears: "prismatic quiet" used twice, elevated diction occasionally strains ("inevitable spiral"), and several filter constructions ("Mira understood," "Chen studied"). The paraphrase loop about secrets being "both singular and universal, both secret and shared" dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum. Information density high in most passages. Some template cadence in middle sections ("Maya began...," "Maya continued..."). Minor paraphrase loop with "cosmic tricksters" repeated without variation. Clear opening and resonant closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong opening/closing lines. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "Marcus understood" constructions, some filter verb clustering ("he heard it," "he thought of"), and abstract philosophical register in peak beats ("tyranny of ordinary space"). The prose serves the concept but occasionally prioritizes elevation over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, but several overwrought metaphors strain clarity: "silence felt complete now, holding truth like cupped hands holding water." Template phrasing appears in the victim descriptions ("victim number one...victim two"), and abstract formulations like "architecture of a shattered mind" reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean with good momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs like "The experimental weather station hummed around her, its instruments tracking the new jet stream patterns that had redrawn the world's coastlines three years ago." Some filter verb clustering ("Elara saw," "understanding finally") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical language ("spongey dread...pressed against her ribs like wet wool") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "dissolved like morning frost," but overwriting appears in phrases like "sculpting possibility from the ashes of 'never.'" Some metaphor density in high-pressure beats ("doorways," "seeds," "luminous disbelief") creates mild congestion without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments but suffers from overwriting in key beats: "rusted into the hillside like a wound healing over," "desperate energy," "gracious calm." The final paragraph contains multiple abstract restatements of the circular theme that dilute momentum. Some template patterns appear: "Marcus [verb]" constructions repeat, and philosophical abstractions accumulate without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that supports the contemplative tone. Information density is high - most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. The opening and closing images create effective bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and good momentum. However, several abstract phrases weaken immediacy ("defied nature's laws," "layers of twisted reality," "spaces between truth and deception"). Some repetitive phrasing around "finding" and mild overwriting in the glass garden description detract from otherwise solid line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery, though abstract passages ("intersection of dreams—that liminal space where collective unconscious met quantum possibility") occasionally drift into conceptual telling. Some elevated diction ("anxious elation thrumming through her veins like electricity through water") borders on overwriting without quite crossing into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Strong opening and closing lines that mirror transformation. Deductions for metaphor density in places ("forgotten veins," "half-lit corridors," "cathedral of bone and bark" clustered closely) and one instance of elevated diction ("inlaying meaning") that creates mild register drift. Some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she understood") in the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of resonant precision ("The quarry office trailer creaked in the November wind") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("that created communion between stage and floor") and abstract phrasing. Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing character or atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between discovery and reflection. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for repetitive "Sarah + verb" constructions in middle sections and slight overwriting in "beautiful geometries" and "romantic speculation."

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery: "pages that fell from books during their transformations, words that couldn't settle into new stories." Some passages tend toward abstract exposition ("showing others that identity could migrate without being lost"). Minor template cadence in the final third with repeated "she [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching emotional beats. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("constellation of reflected possibilities") and some template phrasing ("She thought of... She thought of..."). No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with effective variation between short declaratives ("The accident.") and complex observations about the station's transformation. Information density is high in passages like the bellows description carrying both physical decay and emotional history. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("patient conquest," "ghost of the station's former purpose") and the somewhat rushed final paragraph's philosophical declarations that could have remained more grounded in image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery like "whispers that echoed from nowhere and everywhere at once." Information density is high—most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. Some abstract phrasing ("mixture of caution and exuberance," "infinite potential of the pause") and occasional template constructions ("She began to document," "She lifted her veil") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some metaphorical density borders on purple ("bruised twilight," "mulberry blood"). The phrase "perforated destiny...full of holes where certainty should be" contains mild redundancy. Strong opening and closing lines, but occasional elevated diction ("sublime, returning to mist") creates minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "The emerald chip began to sing—a sound like light given voice." Minor template cadence in "She had been... Then she became... Now" structure, and some abstract phrasing ("beautiful, terrible sculpture") that could be more concrete, though momentum remains strong through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose rhythm varies effectively and key images resonate, but several instances of elevated diction clash with Mara's grounded perspective ("umbral grotto," "concentric rings," "inextricable"). Some filter constructions ("she could feel it," "seemed to scallop") dull immediacy in pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Information density high in passages like the wind chimes revealing backstory. Some overwriting: "absolute but dawn threatens the horizon" strains; "terrible gift of seeing clearly in the fog" edges toward purple. Template phrases like "behind me" and "either way" in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("The stone she'd thrown created one final ring, perfect and complete") though occasionally drifts into abstract territory ("consciousness itself could be taught to slip between moments"). Information density remains high with purposeful rhythm variation, minimal loops.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally between longer meditative passages and shorter declarative moments, with no significant loops or scaffolding, though a few metaphors border on overwriting ("canyon of endless echoes stretched like a wound").

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"Each footfall created small pools of lingering luminance"—but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "impossibilities" and "sacred/simple." The final third contains multiple restatements of the core insight about imperfection's value, creating paraphrase loops that diminish momentum despite strong individual sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("barnacle-crusted hatch," "volumes floated in ankle-deep brine"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density - "meteor hush that pressed against her eardrums like the moment before stars fall" strains. Occasional template phrasing ("moved through," "pulled from") reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("ambered observatory deck floated in the nothing-space"). Some abstract passages create minor density issues ("modified consciousness could process only through the ritual") and occasional filter constructions ("she could perceive the shape"). The recursive structure and purposeful repetition serve the concept well.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph lengths. Information density is good—most lines advance multiple purposes. Deductions for figurative density in non-peak moments ("paint the sky in bruises"), some abstract phrasing ("hollow ache," "vast hurt"), and minor template cadence in the "She [verb]" pattern across several paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong opening ("stretched across the dead sea like a prayer made of stone") and resonant close. Some paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "madness and revelation often wore the same face" followed by similar abstraction. Technical passages occasionally over-explain ("This rate, combined with the viaduct's resonance, should theoretically recreate"). Information density is high but could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and strong opening/closing lines. Information density is good with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some overwriting ("ghostly threshold," "ancient teeth"), one template cadence run in the photography sequence, and slight purple tendency in metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for abstract phrases ("ancient freshness," "frozen wonder"), some repetitive constructions around "grandfather," and occasional register elevation that doesn't fully integrate with voice.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "constellations of bioluminescent moss" and varied sentence rhythms, but several instances of elevated diction ("arbor," "nocturnal") and some filter constructions ("Maya understood immediately," "Maya smiled in the darkness") reduce immediacy. The opening is particularly dense with figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the sparring sequence's mirrored structure. Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and theme. Deductions for occasional abstract scaffolding ("understanding flooding through me—not feeling, not yet, but the architecture where feeling could live") and repetitive constructions around numbness/feeling that border on paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, particularly in atmospheric passages. Information density is generally strong, with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some conceptual repetition appears ("spaces that shouldn't exist" echoes similar ideas) and occasional elevated diction ("orthogonal approaches," "comprehensive development") creates mild register drift without full POV justification.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("mournfully eager" bookend). Some density issues in exposition-heavy middle sections. The phrase "half-dance, half-prayer" and similar constructions feel slightly formulaic. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong moments ("The monastery's walls had become her skeleton, its sealed windows her eyes") with good information density. Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("hollow spaces in her ribs," "frozen exterior world") clusters without full payoff, and occasional filter constructions ("she could feel," "she could sometimes reach") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is adequate with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for some overwriting in figurative language ("frozen bloom of his potential"), occasional redundancy, and template phrasing in the attempt sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied rhythm. Some overwriting in figurative language: "congregation of metal prophets," "frozen light and extinct dreams" cluster densely without pattern-teaching. The fragment "thrummed against her ribs" is physical and specific. Final paragraph contains mild paraphrase loop with "beginnings in their endings" restating the discovered principle.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Marcus" appears 16 times) and some abstract passages that slow momentum. Phrases like "permanent transience" and "existential weight" lean abstract without embodiment. The "every now, always now, forever now" ending risks overwrought repetition though it attempts pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of sharp specificity ("sinew thread contained memories...harvested from moments when people first doubted their eyes"). However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("rational enchantment," "texture of connection") without always grounding in concrete image. Mild template cadence in "She understood...She wove...She pulled" openings.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose is clean with varied sentence structure and strong momentum through teaching sequences. Information density is high without overwriting. However, some passages lean toward exposition ("everything changed six months ago") and the final paragraph contains mild paraphrase loops ("impossible future"/"impossible journey," "infinite sea"/"oceans both terrestrial and cosmic").

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("cathedral of suspended gold," "telegraph of terror"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor deduction for slight purple prose tendency in descriptive passages that doesn't quite match the urgency of the situation.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("casting wan yellow pools that made the water look like amber preservative"). Strong opening/closing images. Some paraphrase loops around the phase chamber discovery section and occasional filter verbs reduce immediacy ("Elena forced herself," "She could see").

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful repetition of the counting motif. Information density is high, though phrases like "ephemeral geometries" and "fragmented digital space" occasionally drift into abstraction. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively mirrors the heartbeat counting.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("cascading through her consciousness"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for the abstract description of Thuvenli's properties and occasional register elevation that creates slight distance from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong momentum with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm changes during key beats. Information density is high—most sentences advance plot, atmosphere, or character simultaneously. Some figurative language approaches oversaturation ("like laughter made physical," "frostbitten hope in her chest bloomed into certainty") but doesn't obscure clarity. Minor scaffold in phrases like "Marina knew better" and "understanding suddenly," though these don't touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for abstract phrases that could be more concrete ("something stirred in her chest," "remembering gentle") and some repetitive constructions around "began to" that slightly dull momentum. The final paragraph contains philosophical abstraction that weakens immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The arcade had been neutral ground...universal language of bleeps"). Minor template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("she caught it, kept it, sent it") and some abstract phrasing ("spaces between heartbreak and hope") that could be more concrete, but momentum remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative language like "morning fog rolled through broken windows like memories refusing to settle" and varied sentence structures create momentum, but several abstract formulations weaken density ("understanding dawning like sunrise through fog"). The phrase "quietly persistent" appears both as trait and adverb, creating mild redundancy. Information density remains high in scene beats, particularly the fragment discovery and garden description.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments—"memories weren't stored in the brain but in the spaces between things"—but suffers from abstract density in crucial beats ("continuous deformation of memory and imagination"). The vision sequence relies on telling ("infinite shelves folding through dimensions") rather than concrete imagery, dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("molten copper," "glass pieces began their work"). Some abstract passages weaken momentum ("fragments of a dream that had escaped her childhood"). Minor repetition of "whisper" variants. The final paragraph contains slight redundancy but maintains clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery—"starlight filtered through impossible angles"—with good rhythmic variation. However, abstract phrasing accumulates in the middle section: "interconnected fears," "collective doubt," "symphony of potential futures" create opacity without sufficient grounding. The opening and closing paragraphs demonstrate stronger concrete language, but the central unlocking sequence relies too heavily on conceptual abstraction rather than sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves good momentum with varied sentence structures and selective detail. Information density is high in discovery passages. Deductions for repetitive phrasing ("Margaret understood now," "Margaret knelt"), some template cadence in the memory listing, and occasional overwriting ("phosphorescence matching the broken constellations").

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "that suspended moment between day and memory." Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("hope dangling like a weapon," "rust on iron") and minor repetition of "backwards" concept. The "microscopic diagrams" and technical magic descriptions occasionally bog momentum. No major clarity issues but could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("golden in this world, silver in the other") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats. Mixed metaphors appear (seed opens "like an eye, like a door, like a memory") and abstract descriptors proliferate ("verdant parapet," "radiant hush"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum, particularly around the concept of wonder and the between-spaces.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well. Some figurative density in places ("jellyfish made of starlight") serves the mystical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. However, abstract phrasing clusters appear ("fundamental had changed," "wordless invitation," "patient accumulation") and some paraphrase loops ("silent testimony"/"wordless invitation"). Template cadence in "She would find...She would reopen" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several passages contain abstract phrasing that slows momentum ("another legendary disappearance solved, another mystery surrendered to time's patient archaeology"). Some metaphorical density in non-peak moments ("darkness thick as centuries") and occasional template constructions ("Marina understood... Marina descended... Marina lifted") reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong information density.

The final paragraph contains mild redundancy. No major artifacts but could be tighter in places.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity ("ice cracking from cables like breaking bones"), but several abstract constructions weaken momentum: "grief had frozen him solid" lacks embodiment, "beauty within isolation" tells rather than shows. Some filter verbs ("she realized," "she noticed") dull immediacy in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or concept. Minor repetitions appear ("she'd documented," "she'd found") and some abstract phrases ("spooled wholeness") lack concrete grounding, though overall momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in passages like "moonbeams through the hollow trunk's carefully placed gaps." Some elevated diction in peak moments ("fractally precise," "prosopagnosia") fits the scholarly setting. Minor repetition of "truth" and occasional filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful variation, though occasional density issues appear in metaphor-heavy passages like the multiple light descriptions. Information density is high with most sentences advancing discovery or atmosphere, but some repetition of "stranded luminance" and "murmuration" patterns could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied syntax. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("hauntingly bright glow of dawn that filtered through walls of ancient ice") and some template phrasing in the prophecy reveals. The "driftwood" callback works but feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures supporting the accumulative rhythm. Information density is generally good, though some passages lean toward the descriptive ("frozen clouds," "butterfly garden watering bell").

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("moonlight carved silver spirals down the canyon walls") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. The "helix-minded" repetition works as pattern but risks becoming a tick.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("water droplets fell upward like silver rain"), but some abstract phrasing dilutes immediacy ("seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze"). Minor template cadence in the crystalline node revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the Inversion sequence. However, some conceptual redundancy appears in the final paragraph ("adaptation meant not fighting change but dancing with it" closely echoes prior revelation). Minor template cadence in "She'd found...She'd discovered" construction. The extended metaphor list in the final sentence, while resonant, slightly over-explains.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful technical precision: "wind speeds of zero and infinity simultaneously" captures paradox economically. Some passages suffer from slight overwriting ("metallic canyons," "practiced ease") and occasional template cadence in the middle section. Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing investigation, discovery, or atmospheric pressure, though a few descriptive passages could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery, but overwriting appears in peak moments ("sculpted hush," "museum of silence," "cathedral of sensation") without pattern-teaching. The density of figurative language in the climax reduces clarity rather than enhancing it.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("possibility," "presence rather than absence"). Minor template cadence in "She'd returned...

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears: "aurora's green ribbons," "spine of ancient stone," "weathered vertebra." Information density is high in key passages like the Convergence scene. Template phrasing emerges in "She watched them... She felt his presence... She carried the responsibility" sequence, creating mild cadence monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the revelation. Information density is high, with most lines advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("each strand of this unmaking carried something away") but suffers from occasional paraphrase loops and abstract phrasing. The "stoically sparkling" repetition works as pattern, though some passages could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose rhythm varies effectively, with shorter sentences during the forging sequence creating momentum. Strong specific images like "silk shimmer with colors that shouldn't exist beneath the planet's twin suns."

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("quietly explosive," "valley-mist wonder") and occasional abstraction ("beauty persists beyond ending") slightly muddy immediacy. The final image effectively recharges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "pin dropping in the assistant astronomer's old quarters, the sound impossibly clear." However, some abstract passages like "machine for processing sorrow" and "aggregate map of human searching" lean toward tell over show. The final paragraph's "patient math of survival" risks over-explicating the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the singing sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("desperate and determined," multiple darkness synonyms) and the final paragraph contains template phrasing ("they would sing together, and in that singing"). Information density could be higher in transitional passages.

    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Template cadence appears in middle philosophical sections ("I hide in the open...I stay while leaving"). Some abstract phrasing ("nestled paradoxes," "liminal moment") lacks concrete embodiment. The final image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of elevated register ("ministry," "absolution," "heuristic kindness") that feel forced. Some paraphrase loops ("sacred hides in ordinary things" / "displaced sacred") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The library fell in perfect silence, a quartz hush"), but several instances of abstract telling ("The magic had been failing for decades") and repetitive constructions ("She had developed...She began...She moved").

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "drowning in reverse" and "algae in still water." Information density high in scenes of market navigation. Deductions for filter verb stack in emotional peaks ("Mae waited, knowing"), some elevated diction outside Mae's voice ("nocturnal rhythm," "gray economy's veins"), and repetitive "Mae [verb]" structures in several passages.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("copper-sweet magnetic north shifting to bitter east") with strong sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("After the last echo of laughter fades, silence becomes a living thing"). Information density high in discovery sequence. Minor template cadence in middle section ("Lyra's chest... Lyra's fingers... Lyra approached") and slight overwriting in "cathedral of stone" and "aurora of colors." Some filter constructions ("seemed to wake") but mostly purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "walls sweating condensation that smelled of copper and regret." Some density issues with stacked metaphors ("breathing leaves that served as the greenhouse city's only reliable communication" could be tighter).

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though phrases like "truth dressed in amazement" and "gossamer of curiosity" edge toward purple in peak moments. The recurring "glistening" effectively transforms from ice property to bell quality, and most sentences advance multiple story functions efficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions like "roses that grew strangely organic despite the synthetic soil—their roots pulsing with something almost like blood." However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "controlled burn" concept restated multiple times, and the final paragraph contains redundant philosophical assertions about staying/escaping.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstract descriptors ("gravity of quiet voices," "invisible network") and telling over showing ("understanding ripple outward"). Template phrasing appears in emotional beats: "tears fell like rain after drought." The final paragraph's extended meditation on lessons learned stalls momentum without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("familiar weight of destiny," "smelling of memories she'd never lived").

Minor template cadence in the middle exposition about the Institute.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though some passages lean toward tell over show ("For twenty years, Mei had wisely endured..."). Minor template cadence in "She had forged... created... destroyed" sequence, but momentum sustains through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("serpentine nexus," "layered like sediment") but occasional abstraction ("vast and eternal," "between dimensions") and some repetitive structures in the middle section.

Deductions for occasional overwriting ("scintillatingly somber rhythm"), some filter-verb clustering ("She could feel," "she saw," "She recognized"), and mild register drift in philosophical passages that edge toward academic diction.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally propels with varied sentence structures and specific imagery like "branches heavy with fruit that glowed faintly." However, several abstract summaries ("deliberate suppression of lifesaving knowledge," "human choice") and repetitive constructions ("Marcus felt," "Marcus faced," "Marcus looked") create minor drag without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves density through lines doing multiple jobs—"The clouds are speaking binary again" establishes weather, technology, and prophetic reception simultaneously.

Filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("she realized," "she understood").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows control with varied sentence rhythms and strong imagery, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("temporary headstone marking where the sea refused to die completely") and abstract phrasing ("fold in patience"). Some metaphors strain credibility, and there's mild repetition around "endings" that borders on thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery. Some overwriting appears in metaphor density ("honey crystallizing in air," "taillights dissolving into dusk" in rapid succession). The phrase "passionate subtlety of aged wine finally uncorked" forces the prompt element awkwardly. Minor template cadence in "She'd laughed... She'd tried... She'd whispered" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure and purposeful fantasy terminology. However, abstract phrases like "wisdom echoes fade" and "vessels designed to preserve" lack concrete imagery.

    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Deductions for overwriting in places ("clouds that never quite touched the earth anymore"), some template phrasing ("Thomas didn't startle anymore"), and occasional register drift. The filter-verb stack is minimal and the closure image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and effective rhythm modulation. Some figurative density in opening paragraphs ("serpentine," "liquid starlight," "ethereal") without clear payoff.

However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "balm and prison"/"protecting...ensuring" restate similar protection/limitation ideas. Template cadence appears in "She would accept...she would also remain...She would bear" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some repetitive structures appear ("She'd found...," "She'd spent..."). Information density is good but occasional abstract phrasing ("serene upheaval complete itself") and mild redundancy in thematic statements reduce momentum. No major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=5.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, but several passages loop conceptually: "ancient techniques for survival, navigation, and communication that were disappearing" followed immediately by similar content about the fisherman's knowledge. The phrase "secret weavers" appears five times without evolving meaning, creating repetitive scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The palace carpet had begun unraveling three autumns ago"). Some elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "labyrinth of explained absences") fits the elegiac tone but occasionally tips toward purple. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong moments like "chains groaning a metallic lament" and effective rhythm variation, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("fevered brightness of mystics and madmen") and some figurative density that doesn't always serve pressure. The paraphrase loop around "beauty need not be perfect to be profound" and the thematically explicit final paragraph cost points, though line-level craft remains generally strong.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("obsidian lagoon breathed beneath the dunes"). Minor template patterns appear ("She understood...she chose," "She was not...nor was she") but don't obscure closure. Information density generally strong with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of elevated diction ("defiant hush," "sidereal patience") feel forced rather than organic. Some redundancy in the fountain descriptions. The ending risks purple prose with "dance partners, moving through time with the patience of stars" but maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and cosmic-scale imagery. Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple functions. Some repetition ("troubling serenity" twice, "falling petals" thrice) creates intended resonance but borders on mechanical. The "share light without using fire" paradox could be clearer on first appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally clean with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in passages like the families' losses. Some filter verb accumulation ("Martha felt," "she suspected") dulls immediacy in middle section. Final paragraph achieves strong momentum without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Information density is good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for the abstract phrasing around the pendulum pause mechanism and occasional overwriting ("dreams that burned with clarity," "marking moments not just of time's passage but of perpetual redemption").

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Lines achieve density through compression ("her shears catching starlight that pooled in the cobalt silo's shadow") and avoid paraphrase loops. However, abstract phrases like "uncharted echoes of meaning" and "the shape of intentions" occasionally muddy clarity, and the middle section's exposition about the tapestry's contents creates a slight momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines like "darkness cannot darken what already gleams black" doing multiple jobs, though some passages drift into elevated register ("visual symphonies of probability").

Rhythm varies naturally between longer descriptive passages and shorter urgent beats. Some mild redundancy in explaining the dust's narrative properties across two separate passages.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some scaffold phrases ("She knew better," "Marlene understood this") could be cut. The final line resonates powerfully, recharging the vanishing/ephemeral motif. No loops or template cadence detected.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some philosophical abstractions slow peak beats ("developing philosophies no one would hear, preserving truths no one wanted"). Strong specific images like "barnacles creep across marble statues." Minor template cadence in the middle section with repetitive "Marcus [verb]" constructions. The final metaphor of sediment settling into proper layers effectively charges the closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("mother-of-pearl inlay," "velvet library absorbed sound") but suffers from abstract phrases like "traveled stillness" and "expectantly resigned" that resist concrete meaning. Some paraphrase loops appear ("vanishing arts vanish"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy during the collaborative music-making.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The greenhouse had been her restaurant once"). Some repetitive phrasing around "memories" and "synaptic plasticity" creates minor loops. Template cadence appears in "She had created... She had saved... She tasted" construction patterns that could vary more.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in places ("like broken promises," "liquid gold") but serves the lyric tone. Minor template moments ("She described...," "They gathered...") don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("streetlights flickered between waking and sleeping—that liminal hour"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("sanctifying themselves," "molecular structure") creates mild register drift. No loops or scaffolding, strong syntactic variety, though "inadvertently profound" appears without full integration.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("kelp forests thread through marble archways"). Several template phrases weaken impact: "surprising herself with," "nearly dropped," "hands trembled"—stock physical reactions. The abstract ending about stone being "animate with possibility" and "every shade of gray" dulls the closure's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("where mathematics became theology and proofs became prophecy") and occasional abstraction. Minor template cadence in "Marcus had..." constructions. The mathematical terminology is precise and serves character. Opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece, though some middle passages edge toward conceptual redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful repetition ("For the old man... For everyone..."). Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("methodically hopeful," "liminal space") and some template phrasing in the message responses section.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the ovens stood cold now, but the walls bore the pressed prints." Some elevated diction ("palimpsest," "irreversible weeping") fits the museum guide's voice.

    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, though occasional overwriting appears ("between decay and divinity," "silk being pulled through broken glass"). Information density is generally high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some minor overwriting in phrases like "restless euphony" and "inevitable collapse" that lean toward abstraction. The "mallet pulsed in her hand like a second heart" borders on cliché but works within context.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines like "The shells' natural spirals had always guided her work—their mathematical perfection teaching her the pattern languages that made sense of this strange world." Strong rhythm variation and zero loops, though occasional filter verbs ("felt wrong," "felt heavy") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose generally clear with varied sentence structure, though some academic abstractions ("emotional rationality," "convenient fiction") and repetitive constructions around the Valorian Empire reduce momentum. The metaphor "seeds of revelation were finally ready to grow" feels slightly forced against the dying rosebush image. Information density is moderate with most sentences advancing plot or theme, but some passages summarize rather than dramatize ("Every war fought in its name").

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The Victorian structure ahead wasn't just another casualty of erosion" establishes official purpose while revealing personal stakes. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm, particularly in the varied paragraph lengths that accelerate toward closure. Some figurative language borders on precious ("hushed blaze of late afternoon light") but generally serves atmosphere without overwhelming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("tranquilly perceptive purpose," "dappled resolve"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in the middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions reduces variety.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty—"grinding away layers of raw anguish while simultaneously lifting the essence of love toward the surface." However, several passages loop conceptually (transformation mentioned repeatedly) and the final paragraph contains unnecessary scaffolding that restates established meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful technical vocabulary. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor issues include the somewhat forced phrase "intangibly tangible" and occasional overwriting ("scarred by a thousand conflicts"), but line-level craft supports the story's ambitions effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("Kira + verb" patterns) and occasional overwriting ("bleeding across worn limestone walls"). The phrase "brilliant dimness" appears twice verbatim. However, technical details are precise and the final image of "two women stood in the frequency of belonging" lands with reasonable power despite the abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("bruised purples," "museum of tempered regret") and occasional redundancy ("false memories"/"false genealogies"). The paraphrase loop in "manufactured memories" concept appears multiple times without significant variation.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong opening ("weighed nothing...yet it anchored her") and closing images. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "wisdom" and "mistakes," plus some abstract constructions ("choreography of redemption") that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("backlash of regrets," "flickering faith evident").

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("another ghost becoming light"). Information density is high without overwriting. Deductions for occasional elevated diction ("indefinable that the procedure couldn't erase") and one instance of abstract phrasing ("something essential") that could be more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery like "apple blossoms glowed pearl-white under the permanent moon." Information density is generally high, though some passages during the transformation contain slight redundancies ("dissolving into the greater tapestry" followed by similar restatements). The opening and closing images effectively bracket the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong imagery and rhythm but suffers from density issues - figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing the story. Mixed metaphors ("onyx-ink," then cards "fell like black snow") create slight incoherence. Abstract phrases like "choking beauty" and "time's strange mercy" appear multiple times, dulling impact.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("hull a patchwork of salvaged vessels stitched together") but suffers from abstract phrases that slow momentum ("singular purpose," "externalized rather than heal"). Template constructions appear in emotional description ("recoiled, but she held steady") and some filter verbs cluster unnecessarily ("felt herself grow," "felt no fear").

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("silk becoming iron becoming starlight," "texture of transformation") approaches overwriting, and the phrase "vibrant hush" appears twice, but line-level craft remains clean overall.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum through the courtyard sequence. Information density is high with details serving multiple purposes. Minor issues with some elevated diction ("accumulated small rebellions," "orchestrated through bronze and shadow") and occasional abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("knowing what would happen had never meant controlling it" restates the earlier curse description), and phrases like "ancient creatures" and "eternal dance" lean generic.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but several instances of abstract telling ("furiously tranquil," "eternal three minutes") and mild overwriting in metaphor density. Some paraphrase loops around the censorship theme. Information density is high but occasionally sacrifices clarity for poeticism.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied syntax, though some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("glass atrium caught morning light like a prism"). Information density is high - most sentences advance both surface and coded narratives. Minor template issues with "Marlowe [verb]" repetition in places but rhythm generally supports the cerebral dueling pace.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs (moonlight both illuminates and symbolizes). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("luminous fractures," "liquid silver," "small revolution") without full payoff. Template cadence appears in Marcus section ("He'd introduced...They called it...") reducing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the sun tracked its arc toward evening" simultaneously marks time, isolation, and routine—though occasional filter constructions ("Marion could feel") slightly dull immediacy. The syntactic variety from complex opening imagery to shorter action beats during the improvisation creates effective rhythm without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though "luminous doubt" and similar phrases appear multiple times creating mild repetition. Strong information density in memory sequences. The final paragraph contains some abstract phrasing that slightly dulls impact but doesn't obscure meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some metaphorical density in places ("the color of cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat"). Information density high - most lines do multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in "Tomorrow, he would..." repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and largely free of artifacts. A minor template cadence appears in the paragraph beginning "She'd spent years..." with three "She [verb]..." constructions, costing a slight deduction. Otherwise, figurative language is coherent and serves the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and purposeful, vivid imagery. A very minor rhythmic repetition in a few consecutive sentences ("thermal symphony," "singing in wavelengths") prevents a higher score, though it does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, but a few instances of near-redundancy ("flooded subway tunnels, through drowned cities") and a minor register drift ("bubble of breathable grief") slightly mar an otherwise exceptional line-level execution. No artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. Minor thesaurus-churn in "benevolent shadows" and a slight filter verb in "she understood" prevent a higher score, but these do not obscure closure. The final paragraph's cadence is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. A single potential artifact—"like a prayer written in stone"—is a strong, taught image that sets the tone rather than ornamental overwriting. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical with superb rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like sugar dissolving in tears," "like watercolor paintings"), though it remains coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery ("gleamed like scales," "swirling like captured spirits"). Information density is high. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the high-pressure beat of the revelation ("shimmered," "seep through molecular gaps," "carried an undercurrent") which, while apt, borders on over-stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery, though slight overwriting appears in phrases like "symphony of running water and cracking ice." No loops or scaffolds; figurative language consistently serves character and atmosphere. Closure image remains clear and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density; most sentences advance multiple elements.

Otherwise, the language is concise, vivid, and propulsive without loops or scaffolding. The closure image remains sharp and unaffected.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Exquisite prose with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor risk of overwriting exists in the density of figurative language ("ambered hush," "marbled hush"), but it is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative drive, never obscuring clarity or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, such as the courtyard gleaming "like polished steel."

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. There is a slight tendency toward elevated diction ("elaborate architectures of protection") that, while voice-motivated, brushes against the POV's lexicon in a peak beat, preventing a higher score. No loops or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, e.g., "fruit ripening toward rot."

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and efficient, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative density appears in a high-pressure beat ("reality rippled like water"), slightly muddling sense but not obscuring closure. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellent with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a slight scaffold phrase ("Marcus understood then") and a minor filter verb stack in a high-pressure beat trigger a small deduction. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise masterful, accelerating toward the climax without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. However, minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats ("like grief made visible," "like altitude sickness"), causing slight register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("the world had gone bronze-quiet since the last human dream flickered out"). Minor figurative strain in "diaries lay scattered like broken birds" slightly muddles tone, but overall rhythm supports accumulation. No loops or scaffolding; closure image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("arranging fortune slips like sheet music") serves character and atmosphere without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits masterful rhythm and density, with figurative language consistently serving pattern and payoff. Minor register elevation in peak beats ("plumb your depths and find them shallow") slightly distances POV, but clarity and propulsion remain uncompromised.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion with zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is complex but coherent and purpose-driven, even in peak beats ("the mirrored horizon began to fold"). Sentence-level rhythm is masterful, accelerating and breathing in perfect step with the scene's needs toward its crystalline closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor template cadence emerges in one paragraph ("The soldier's courage, the mother's love..."), creating a slight list-like effect in an otherwise propulsive climax. This artifact is minor and does not touch the closure, but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, never muddying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lush and highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists in the first paragraph ("trembled with morning light, each translucent fruit catching fire"), but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure causality or the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, efficient imagery. Information density is high; sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere.

    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates with the revelation. There is no scaffolding, synonym churn, or figurative muddle. A single minor instance of slightly abstract phrasing ("buried optimism") is quickly grounded in the concrete verb "bloom." The prose is lucid and propulsive throughout, especially in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is concise and highly efficient, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "This was how he'd learned to exist—through kindly, methodical acts of providence" advances character, theme, and plot). Rhythm is controlled and varies with pressure. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. Information density is high without sacrificing clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and sensory density. However, a minor register drift occurs in the phrase "reluctant metamorphosis that pulled at his human certainty," which feels slightly abstract and diagnostic for the POV in a peak beat. This is a hairline slip that does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum, but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("liquified time," "edges sharp as broken shells"). There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, varying rhythm to match the contemplative and climactic beats. The opening and closing lines are perfectly anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a tendency toward slightly over-stacked figurative language in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "the steady unpredictability of each moment choosing to become the next"), which creates a slight loss of propulsion. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are well maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight paraphrase loop: "compile fragments into meaning" is used in both dialogue and the final paragraph.

    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Sentences advance multiple jobs of story, character, and atmosphere. A single instance of potential "therapy-speak" ("where hearts can break") creates a minor figurative muddle in a peak beat, but it is an isolated artifact that does not measurably obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is elegant and dense, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Minor flaw: the metaphor "dust wheezed out like a confession" slightly strains coherence. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffolding; every sentence advances character or atmosphere with high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor instance of figurative density appears in the high-pressure climax: "consciousness folding through time like origami being undone and refolded" is a slightly mixed metaphor that momentarily obscures clarity. This is a hairline slip that does not significantly harm closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly polished with excellent rhythm and variation. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the final paragraph ("mulberry blood"), which, while evocative, slightly slows the cadence of the closure beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation that accelerates with the Silence's approach. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of potential abstract phrasing at the climax ("something unlock in her chest") which slightly dulls the immediacy of an otherwise perfectly embodied peak beat. Otherwise, the prose is flawless, propulsive, and free of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("designer uncertainty," "cloak of doubt").

No loops or scaffold issues; clarity remains intact through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and concise with strong momentum. Minor artifacts include a template cadence ("The midnight pattern seeker floated... her fingers tracing...") and a slight paraphrase loop between "soundless echo" and "peculiar quality of silence." These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A single minor loop exists ("not emotional weight, not yet, but the potential for it") but does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and syntactic variety. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat ("patterns began to erupt more violently... like living equations"), where the figurative language stacks slightly, though it does not obscure closure clarity. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly evocative with strong rhythm and sensory detail. A slight density of figurative language in the final paragraphs creates a minor momentum drag, but clarity is maintained. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent information density and sensory specificity. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating with the discovery of the fading photo. A minor -0.4 deduction for a template-cadence run in the final paragraph ("She hadn't meant... had only been... But sometimes..."), which slightly dulls the closure's impact compared to the sharper imagery preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Figurative language is mostly purposeful, though the cluster in the final paragraph ("crashing hush," "prayer," "heart that no longer beat") creates a minor decorative pile-up. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; sentence-level propulsion is excellent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor instance of figurative density appears in the climax: "a new form of existence straddling the boundary between flesh and data" leans slightly toward conceptual summary in a high-pressure beat. This prevents a score above 9.0, but the line-level propulsion and clarity remain otherwise superb.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly concise and propulsive, with vivid, specific imagery ("lavender that floated upward like smoke"). Sentence-level rhythm is varied and supports the scene's tension. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) is applied for a cluster of dense metaphors in a high-pressure beat ("a sensation like laughter made physical," "cosmic joke," "frostbitten hope... bloomed into certainty") which, while effective, slightly risks clarity in the crucial climax.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. A minor deduction for the slightly thematic phrase "tarnished wonder," which feels like a label, though it is quickly redeemed by the concrete image of fire in the strings.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean, propulsive lines with efficient imagery; little to no scaffold or paraphrase looping. Figurative language is mostly precise and anchored to concrete objects (kelp, marble, foxglove), avoiding mixed metaphors. The “dominoes falling upward” image is a slight flourish but remains intelligible and apt to the reversal of time’s flow. Syntax varies to match pressure, and the final sentence lands with compressed clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lines are lean with purposeful repetition and high information density; images often do dual duty (probability as both world-rule and grief-language). Minor near‑echoes are functional rather than filler; figurative choices stay coherent. Cadence supports the accumulative pressure without sludge.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished, image-rich, and largely efficient; metaphors (curves like water, angles like bird wings) cohere with the calligraphy motif. Minimal scaffolding or loops; sentences carry multiple functions (world, emotion, action). A few abstract statements could be tightened, but momentum holds and the final line lands cleanly. No figurative muddle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lean and evocative, with images doing multiple jobs (opera glass as tool and heirloom; rosewater as ominous clock).

    Sentences are clean, varied, and purposeful, with high information density and minimal scaffold. Figurative touches (pulsing algae, humming spines) are consistent and grounded in the world’s logic. Repetition (algae glow) functions as motif rather than redundancy. Pacing accelerates naturally toward reactivation with no muddled metaphors or register slips.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry good momentum with layered information; imagery is rich yet mostly controlled. A few lines risk over‑explicit abstraction (“luminous torment”) but are anchored by tactile detail. No notable loops or scaffold; rhythm varies. The final paragraph lands with a clean, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lean, propulsive sentences carry information density without scaffold or loops; rhythm flexes with tension.

    Line-level craft is strong: varied syntax, clean propulsion, and images that do multiple jobs. Occasional abstraction recurs (“reality rearranged itself,” “orchestrated coincidences”), but clarity remains intact and momentum holds. Figurative density is high yet controlled; minimal repetition avoids loops. Final images land cleanly without purple muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and imagistic without significant clutter; lines multitask (world‑building and pressure). Occasional elevated phrasing skirts purple but remains coherent and precise. Minimal redundancy and good sentence variety keep momentum. The final cadence lands crisply on charged images.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentence craft is polished and image-rich with good momentum; most lines do more than one job. A touch of purple in stacked metaphors is present but controlled, and clarity remains intact at peak beats. No obvious loops or scaffolding slow the read. The final line lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with vivid yet purposeful metaphor (“atlas of absences,” “cartography of scars”) propels rather than stalls. Minor purple glints and a couple near‑redundant formulations (“storm/grammar of storms”) don’t obscure clarity. Rhythm varies, and sentences do multiple jobs without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry good variety and momentum; images often do double duty (geometry as rhetoric). Figurative language is frequent but mostly disciplined and consistent with the motif. Minimal scaffolding or loops; no muddled metaphors in the final third. Slight purplish glints don’t obstruct clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry layered work (image, action, theme) with few redundancies; metaphor is largely coherent (“liquid silver,” “luminous fractures”). Minor purple tilts are restrained and do not blur causality. Pacing fits a quiet, nocturnal build with clean syntax and strong verb choices. No notable loops or scaffolding dull the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)

== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and carries high information density without feeling overwritten. The rhythm and syntax support the story's quiet, observant mood. The line-level craft is nearly flawless, with strong verbs and specific imagery, such as the dust carrying "equal gravity" to a neutron star.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with high information density and clear momentum. A few instances of abstract summary, like "scorched testament to ambition's true price," slightly flatten the immediacy compared to the otherwise concrete, imagistic language. While the overall craft is superb, these minor moments of telling prevent it from reaching the highest tier of flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, specific imagery ("crystallized breath," "prismatic symphonies"). Momentum is well-maintained through a focus on action and discovery. A minor flaw appears in the final two paragraphs, where sentences like "beauty finds new ways to be heard" function as scaffolding, telling the reader the theme directly rather than trusting the images to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. However, a few key moments rely on abstract conceptual phrases ("breathable grief," "mausoleums from... memory") that, while fitting, slightly reduce the visceral immediacy. The final line about the living burying themselves feels a touch glib, slightly breaking the profound tone established just before it.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and often lyrical, particularly in its opening and key descriptions like "benevolent shadows." However, the final paragraph slips into summary, using conceptual language ("The intergenerational support she'd dreamed of building...") to explain the outcome rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the conclusion. This narrative scaffolding in the final beat slightly dulls the otherwise potent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and precise for the most part, with striking images like "compressed starlight and forgotten promises." However, there are a few instances of near-paraphrasing that slightly dull the impact of the final revelation. For example, the idea that the camera "unveils what light concealed" is later echoed by "The camera obscura wasn't for capturing but for releasing," which feels like a slight restatement rather than a purely new insight born of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its imagery ("bleeding their colors into the air like watercolor paintings left in rain"). The line-level craft is strong, with varied sentence structures that support the story's momentum. A minor weakness is a slight tendency toward abstract nominalizations ("retrocognitive imprisonment," "temporal sensation") that, while necessary for the concept, occasionally feel less grounded than the potent sensory details surrounding them.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-structured and the pacing is excellent. Some phrases, like "understanding bloomed" or "staggering grace," lean on familiar literary constructions, and a couple of moments of thematic summary ("...the possibility of redemption itself") slightly blunt the overall sharpness of an otherwise very polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with striking and original imagery. Sentences are crafted with immense care, propelling the narrative forward with a confident rhythm. A minor deduction is warranted for a few moments where thematic explication becomes slightly too overt, such as the direct comparison of investors' cells to her grandfather's tumors. While beautifully written, this momentarily steps into an authorial register that slightly undermines the character's immediate, embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and a strong, rhythmic cadence. Figurative language, like the station walls gleaming "like scales," is evocative and fresh. A minor paraphrase loop slightly dulls momentum in one paragraph ("The golden hour made everything beautiful, but beauty could lie. Her moonbeams stripped away the glamour..."), a small friction point in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with high information density in most lines. The sentence-level propulsion is strong, mirroring Marina's deliberate pace. The score is held back from the highest tier by a few minor overwriting slips and figurative clichés ("symphony of running water," "captured suns") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp specificity of the language.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, vivid, and generally propulsive, with strong opening imagery. The primary weakness is in the final two paragraphs, which drift into summary and thematic explanation ("understanding that his fears were his strength... whispered secrets of transformation..."). This dilutes the impact of the final moments by telling the reader what to feel, rather than letting the preceding action and final image resonate on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is consistently elegant and information-dense, with a lyrical rhythm that supports the story's meditative tone. Figurative language is rich and cohesive, though its sheer density borders on overwriting in a few places; however, it never breaks its own internal logic. There are no wasted words, and the sentence-level propulsion is masterfully controlled, slowing into the "ambered hush" and returning to motion as the oracle descends.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, concise, and often elegant, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. Sentences are well-crafted, and there are no significant line-level artifacts like loops or overwritten passages. The only weakness is a tendency toward abstraction in the final paragraphs, where the language becomes more explanatory than sensory, slightly reducing the momentum and immediacy of the otherwise strong conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with figurative language that consistently deepens character and atmosphere ("scratched surface catching fragments of light like broken promises"). Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the quiet tension. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line contributes to the story's momentum and resonant emotional effect.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, strong verbs, and evocative, precise imagery ("destiny could be weighed like flour," "a smile both blooming and withering, like fruit ripening toward rot"). The prose is clean, with varied sentence structures creating a compelling rhythm. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every sentence works to advance the story's purpose with grace and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, concise, and evocative, with high information density in every line. The use of paradox ("icy warmth," "mechanically warm efficiency") is a consistent and effective stylistic choice that reinforces the story's themes. Sentences are varied and propulsive, and there are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting, even in the climactic moments. The final line is a perfect, resonant cadence that lands with finality and wonder.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is clean, evocative, and carries a high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentences like "The music didn't disrupt the silence so much as give it shape" demonstrate a rare level of precision and elegance. The rhythm and pacing are flawless, accelerating into the climax and settling into the quiet awe of the resolution. There are no technical faults, loops, or scaffolding to be found.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and a powerful, cadenced rhythm. Figurative language, such as truth swaying "like prayer flags" or the aurora like "grief made visible," is both original and perfectly suited to the story's tone. The piece is immaculate at the line level, with no scaffolding, loops, or overwriting to dull its momentum or clarity, culminating in a final paragraph that resonates with earned power.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptional: clean, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, as in the valve wheel's beads being "like DNA strands," linking the object to the people it represents. Sentences are crafted for momentum and density, with no wasted words or scaffolding. The final paragraph's repetition of "like" creates a resonant, prayer-like cadence that lands the ending perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and exquisitely crafted, with high information density in its imagery. However, the relentless lyricism and a tendency toward conceptual restatement create a texture that is more static than propulsive. While individual sentences are beautiful, their cumulative effect occasionally slows momentum, reading as a series of profound observations rather than a narrative moving toward closure, a minor friction in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, with strong verbs and evocative, specific imagery that carries the story's emotional weight. Sentences are well-paced, creating a rhythm that mirrors the quiet, deliberate nature of the ritual. The piece loses some points for a few phrases that feel slightly overwritten or like thematic labels, such as "love itself was the most softly adaptive force in the universe," which tip from profound into platitude and momentarily break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and resonant figurative language that feels earned rather than ornamental. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or the advancement of knowledge. The final paragraph is a perfect example of controlled, powerful prose bringing a story to a resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control in every line. Sentences like "Through salt-stained windows, the lighthouse beam swept across black waters, illuminating nothing and everything" establish the tone and theme with remarkable economy. There is zero scaffolding, redundancy, or overwriting; the language is precise, evocative, and propels the narrative with a quiet, inexorable momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and inventive, with numerous memorable phrases. The sentence-level craft is of a very high order, creating propulsion and atmosphere simultaneously. The score is slightly tempered by a tendency toward abstract intellectualizing that can feel overwrought, and a few moments in the final act where exposition ("knowing that...") replaces the pure imagistic power demonstrated earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and impeccably controlled, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is not ornamental but fundamental to the story's logic, as when memories drift "like musical notes seeking their proper measure." There are no loops or redundancies; the sentences build with a deliberate, musical momentum toward the final crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is evocative and clean, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The language effectively balances high-concept terminology with visceral description. Minor moments of near-redundancy slightly reduce momentum, such as describing the tablet as both "heavier than physics should allow" and having "impossible mass" in the same sentence, but these instances are infrequent and do not detract from the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative for most of the story, with high information density in its descriptions. However, the momentum is slightly dulled in the final paragraphs by a shift to a didactic rhythm and the use of scaffolding phrases like "She understood now..." and "The broken phonograph needle had taught her this...". This move toward summary over scene slightly weakens an otherwise excellent piece of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and possesses high informational density. Lines like "each measurement a small act of integrity against the chaos beyond the wall" are both beautiful and purposeful. While a couple of minor phrases verge on cliché (e.g., the pigeon's "intelligence that seemed almost human"), the overall craft is exceptional, with strong verbs and varied syntax driving momentum flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense with meaning, particularly in the first half. Lines like "each molecule a ghost of botanical history" demonstrate exceptional craft. The momentum flags slightly in the penultimate paragraph, which restates Elara's new purpose in a slightly repetitive manner. This minor scaffolding prevents a perfect score, but the overall execution is polished and evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and precise for most of the story, with strong, evocative imagery like "Time had texture here, rough like the rope's weave." There is, however, a slight tendency toward over-articulation in the final two paragraphs, with phrases like "impossible mathematics of human morality" and "terrible beautiful complexity." These abstractions, while fitting the tone, slightly blunt the sharpness of the otherwise concrete and visceral prose.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep. Word choice is precise and evocative ("ash-dusted glass doors," "shipwrecks ringed the greenhouse like broken teeth"). The writing achieves a rare clarity and concision, where every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and momentum, resulting in a piece that feels both polished and deeply felt.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant, vivid, and information-dense, with strong sensory details and precise word choice. The line-level craft is consistently high, propelling the narrative forward with a confident rhythm. A deduction is applied because the final paragraph functions as a prose artifact, summarizing the theme in a way that slightly dulls the impact of the preceding scene work and the potent final image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally graceful and precise, with strong imagery like "tears fell like rain on calm water." However, the final paragraph drifts into abstraction and cliché ("lifting silent contributors from shadow into starlight"). This overwriting slightly dulls the closure by trading the story's grounded specificity for generic, elevated sentiment. This is the primary prose artifact preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is luminous and carefully crafted, with strong opening and closing images. Sentences are generally clear and propulsive. The main weakness is a slight over-reliance on adjectival density and poetic abstractions ("luminescent ache of belonging"), particularly in the final two paragraphs. While beautiful, this sometimes creates a soft-focus effect where sharper, more concrete imagery might have landed with greater force, slightly dulling the otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, propulsive, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening paragraphs that establish a complex world with fluid grace. The line-level craft is strong throughout. A minor deduction is applied for the final paragraphs, where sentences like "She'd found where echoes were born..." and "In finding where echoes were born..." create a slight paraphrase loop that summarizes a discovery the reader just witnessed, momentarily slowing the powerful concluding momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The piece is marred by the final paragraphs, which become too explanatory and less evocative. The sentence "Loss was only ambiguous because humans insisted on binary definitions..." reads more like an authorial thesis than a character's embodied thought, a prose artifact that slightly dulls the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with every sentence contributing to character, mood, or momentum. Word choice is consistently strong, particularly in its sensory descriptions like "sapphire hush of dawn" and "constellation of memory." The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting, maintaining a clean and propulsive rhythm that carries the reader effortlessly to its resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery like the leaf dissolving "like watercolor on wet paper." The rhythm is well-paced and momentum is strong. A minor weakness is a slight tendency toward summary in the closing paragraphs, such as explaining that the transformation would "sustain the nursery's secret purpose," which tells the reader the consequence rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with no wasted words or overwrought descriptions. Information density is high; single phrases like "metallic hollowness" in the woman's eyes convey entire histories of hardship. The rhythm of the sentences shifts to match the story's pace, from the focused trek across the causeway to the still, heavy moment of the exchange. There are no notable line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolds; the craft is clean, confident, and serves the story's emotional core without distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions ("resonant darkness shot through with phosphorescent veins"). However, the final paragraphs become slightly repetitive in their conceptual language, cycling through "unseen forces," "everyday magic," and "hidden enchantments." This minor conceptual loop slightly dulls the propulsion of an otherwise sharp and beautifully rendered piece.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with sentences that are both beautiful and functional. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, creating a propulsive yet melancholic momentum. There are no technical flaws, loops, or redundancies. The only minor imperfection is the final sentence, which slips into abstract summary, telling the reader the meaning that the preceding paragraphs had already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong momentum. Word choice is generally excellent, creating a tangible sense of wonder and dread. A few phrases, like "the devotion of a medieval monk illuminating scripture," lean slightly purple, and the repetition of "analytically artistic mind" feels like a label, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, demonstrating high information density without feeling cluttered. Sentences are well-paced, creating a contemplative momentum that fits the story's tone. Word choice is precise, and there are no discernible loops, scaffolding, or other prose artifacts that dull the story's impact, even in its most abstract moments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong imagery and a confident rhythm. Lines like "gravity obeyed suggestions rather than laws" establish the world with concise elegance. A minor repetition—describing both Vex's and Thorne's voices with a "thunder" metaphor—is the sole hairline imperfection that keeps the score from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is clean, confident, and highly effective, marked by high information density and strong verbs. Lines like "Death couldn't be conned" and "the cancer was just his body's way of keeping honest books" are thematically sharp and memorable. While a few phrases verge on the familiar (e.g., "twisted with decades of inherited rage"), the overall craft is superb, with a rhythm that supports the story's deathly, vital tone.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with high information density in its imagery. Lines like "its evening prayers absorbed into the valley's throat" are exceptional. However, a few phrases like "incandescent restraint" lean towards abstraction where a more concrete image might have been stronger. The overall effect is one of masterful control, with only the slightest hints of overwriting preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is consistently excellent, marked by high information density, striking figurative language ("metal cliffs," "drowned quiet"), and a varied, propulsive rhythm. There is no evidence of overwriting, scaffolding, or repetitive sentence structures. Each line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or the accumulative drive, resulting in a piece that is both economical and deeply evocative. The craft at the line level is of immediate publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, specific imagery ("broken crown," "dying moths") that establishes atmosphere effectively. The rhythm is well-paced and the sentences are clean, with high information density. The piece avoids major artifacts, but a few moments of slight narrative convenience ("Marina understood suddenly") momentarily reduce the earned sense of discovery present elsewhere in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely effective, with strong opening and closing lines. Its primary flaw is a tendency to summarize key psychological and tactical moments ("decoded it instantly," "Her plan emerged like graffiti itself") where dramatization would be more powerful. This strategic telling keeps the pace brisk but sacrifices some of the emotional depth and procedural tension in the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and almost flawless, with strong verbs and evocative, precise imagery. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic and emotional effect, propelling the quiet narrative forward with a powerful sense of grace. A very slight imprecision with the phrase "chemical message system," which functions simply as a timer, is the only hairline imperfection in an otherwise masterful piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, with strong sensory details that ground Maya's unique perspective. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward with a steady rhythm. The primary weakness is a tendency toward summary in a few key moments, such as "She had become a heartfelt artisan not in spite of her blindness, but because of it," which tells the reader what the rest of the story shows so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly efficient, with no wasted words or overwrought descriptions. Information density is high, with imagery and action working in tandem (e.g., "stretched like a cataract eye, its surface scarred by pressure ridges"). The syntax varies to match the story's pacing, from the observational calm of the opening to the tense brevity of the final scene. There are no notable prose artifacts; the craft is clean and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is elegant, clear, and propulsive, with high information density. The prose demonstrates excellent rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. The only minor weakness is the final paragraph, which slightly overwrites the ending by summarizing the theme ("...not through force or fortune, but through the simple magic of moving together...") rather than fully trusting the preceding images to convey it.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and high-impact, with memorable phrasing like "gathered hush" and a strong rhythmic control. However, a few minor instances of telling over showing ("The temple had been built to harness the ephemeral") and a touch of cliché ("terrified and thrilled her") slightly blunt the edge. While exceptionally strong, these small imperfections prevent it from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is largely elegant and precise, with a strong opening and many evocative phrases. However, the critical moment of revelation is handled in summary rather than scene ("Images flooded through: the real killer, the prison's first warden..."). This strategic choice to tell, rather than show, the story's most pivotal information flattens the momentum at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently lush, vivid, and controlled, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The high density of figurative language is a bold stylistic choice that almost entirely succeeds in building the unique atmosphere. A few abstract phrases like "compressed time" slightly dilute the concreteness in an otherwise immaculate line-level performance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is overwhelmingly strong, with sharp, memorable imagery ("phantom stitches," "coral that learned to breathe air"). The momentum is well-paced for a lyrical piece. The score is held back from the highest tier by a few instances of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly strained ("painted the canyon walls the color of dried blood and hope") and a few abstract pronouncements that tell rather than show ("catching invisible threads that connected past to possible future").

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional—concise, evocative, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful ("lifted tombs like gentle hands," "a forgotten promise"). The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a mastery of craft that propels the narrative with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by its elegance, clarity, and rhythmic control. Figurative language, such as the arcade's fixtures catching light "like memories of a future that never quite arrived," is both beautiful and purposeful. There are no wasted words or repetitive structures; every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, or the quiet unfolding of Mira's ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, striking imagery ("bruise against the sky," "hemoglobin code"), and a lyrical rhythm. Every sentence works to advance the narrative or deepen the atmosphere without a single wasted word or clunky phrase. The line-level craft is polished to a degree that makes the story feel both effortless and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and generally polished, with a strong rhythmic control that supports the story's momentum. The density of figurative language is high but mostly effective within the magical-realist frame. Minor points are lost for a few abstract conceptual phrases ("the space where an apology waits unspoken," "the moment before deciding") that feel slightly writerly and momentarily distance the reader from the raw emotion.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There are moments where the figurative language becomes slightly dense ("a map of neural pathways, or perhaps the branching routes of human connection"), bordering on overwriting. The final two paragraphs also contain some summary and abstraction where more direct imagery could have carried the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. There are a few instances of familiar figurative language ("fold around her like silk," "chest ache") that slightly soften the otherwise sharp and original imagery. However, these are minor slips that do not affect momentum or the clarity of the powerful closing beat. The overall craft is polished and professional.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and largely excellent, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. There is one moment of minor overwriting where the magic's effects are described in a slightly list-like summary ("a place where sound became visible, where painted dreams breathed..."), which momentarily tells rather than evokes. This is a hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and high-impact, with phrases like "photosynthetic rebellion" showcasing real craft. The information density is high without feeling cluttered, and the momentum is excellent. The sequence of insect defenses borders on being slightly too convenient but is delivered with such confidence that it works as a cascade of cultivated chaos.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with high information density in its figurative language. The rhythm is controlled and serves the story's meditative pace. There are, however, moments where the density of metaphor feels slightly overwrought, and the final paragraphs contain minor paraphrase loops that restate the established outcome. These are small imperfections in an otherwise beautifully crafted piece, but they slightly dull the final beat's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a confident rhythm. However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, occasionally bordering on overwriting (e.g., "foxglove regret, beautiful and poisonous in equal measure"). This high poetic register slightly lessens the impact of the most critical moments by making them texturally indistinguishable from the surrounding narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("danced before her eyes," "crystallizing like frost patterns"). Momentum is well-paced, building from quiet focus to exhilarated discovery. A few phrases trend toward elegant abstraction or stock constructions ("knots of misunderstanding," "thrum with possibility") where more concrete particulars could have been sharper, but there are no significant loops, scaffolds, or momentum-killing artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its use of figurative language. The opening is immediately arresting, and the rhythm is controlled throughout. A minor deduction is warranted for the slight overuse of the key phrase "encrypted compassion," which is repeated a bit too explicitly for such a short work, bordering on a thematic loop where implication would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. The rhythm and syntax support the story's meditative, healing pace. There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding. The sentences propel the narrative forward with a quiet, confident momentum, creating a rich atmosphere through strong verbs and specific, sensory nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and precise for the most part, but marred by minor recurring artifacts. The repetition of "featherly determined" and "fractured hush" feels like a tic rather than a deliberate motif. The final paragraph contains a slightly overwritten, abstract phrase ("atmospheric pressure of a daughter's love") that dilutes the preceding concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Sentences are crafted with a strong rhythmic sense, and word choice is consistently precise and evocative ("shadowseam wonder," "dialogue between sky and abyss"). There are no textual artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every line serves to build atmosphere or advance Mira's understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and controlled. Figurative language is inventive and serves to build the world and characterize the protagonist's unique perception. The piece maintains momentum and clarity despite its lyrical quality, with no evidence of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting. Every sentence feels purposeful and polished.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with no line-level artifacts to disrupt momentum. Sentences like "stars pricked through the marine layer like pinholes in black velvet" establish atmosphere with concise power. The more intellectual phrasing ("engineering spontaneity," "emotional frequencies") is successfully integrated as part of Marcus's specific character voice, avoiding the trap of authorial intrusion and adding to the story's textural richness.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, in the story's peak moments, the figurative language occasionally becomes dense with familiar high-concept descriptors ("swirling nebulae," "galaxies might spin") that feel less specific than the story's strongest details. This slight drift into generic cosmic imagery slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly superb, with precise, evocative language and a strong, varied rhythm. Information density is high, and the figurative language is both original and fitting. The score is held back from the highest tier only by the final paragraph, where the prose structure becomes a list of thematic takeaways, creating a slight conceptual loop that softens the landing of an otherwise sharp and luminous piece.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with meaning, demonstrating high-level craft. Sentences like "destruction and creation shared the same violent tenderness" are luminous. A minor deduction is warranted for a few phrases that feel slightly too declarative or self-aware, such as the neat summary of his "unconscious but binding" bargain, which creates a momentary register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm and syntax support the story’s serene, focused atmosphere. A minor weakness appears in the penultimate paragraph where the sentence, "She would revitalize her grandmother's work, not by bringing her back but by completing the journey she'd started," functions as a summary, slightly looping the realization that was just dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely free of artifacts. Sentences are well-constructed, and the rhythm supports the story's contemplative pace. A minor weakness is a slight tendency to state conclusions that are already implied by the action, such as, "The film negative strip suddenly made sense." This creates a small drag on momentum but does not significantly impair the story's overall quality.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and evocative figurative language that feels both fresh and integral. Sentences are constructed with precision and grace, propelling the narrative forward while simultaneously building atmosphere. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every word serves a clear purpose, contributing to a polished and immersive reading experience that is publishable as is.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, as in "a constellation of almost-peace" and "moving like grief itself." The sentence structure varies to control momentum, and there are no wasted words or scaffold phrases. The story demonstrates a high level of line-level craft from its first sentence to its last.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with many lines serving multiple narrative functions. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, modulating with the scene's needs. While a few figurative phrases verge on being overwrought ("acoustic fossil beds"), the overall craft is exceptionally high, with no technical errors, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, elegant, and dense with purpose-driven figurative language that rarely falters. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative forward with a lyrical grace. There are minor instances where the conceptual language becomes slightly overwrought ("her form writing rebellion in the snow-bright air"), but overall clarity and momentum remain very high.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled. However, there is a recurring tendency towards aphoristic statements and beautifully crafted explanations that feel slightly overwrought, bordering on telling. For instance, "the most subversive act wasn't to shout truth but to whisper it in forms so beautiful..." is a thematic summary that slightly undermines the power of the dramatized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in its figurative language ("orange wings like torn sunset," "prisms that hung like unfinished sentences"). The rhythm is deliberate and controlled, matching the character's movements. A few phrases lean towards the overly poetic ("blushing stillness"), but they remain consistent with the established voice and do not obscure clarity or momentum. The piece is free of scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. However, a few key moments rely on abstract summary rather than concrete action, slightly dulling the momentum. Phrases like "The process illuminated something profound" and "Her forgiveness hadn't ended her responsibility; it had revealed her true inheritance" function as scaffolding, telling the reader the significance of an event instead of letting the preceding images and actions carry the weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language is strong and integrated, as in "letters bleeding rust down the walls like tears of iron." There are no significant loops or scaffolding; every sentence serves a purpose. The final line is a standout example of concise, powerful writing that pays off the entire story's conceptual weight in a single, concrete image. The craft is clean and highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong, evocative imagery. There is a slight tendency toward summary and scaffolding in key moments, such as "The covenant required sacrifice—not blood but dedication...". This momentarily shifts from showing to telling, creating a minor drag on the otherwise excellent momentum leading into the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it relies heavily on abstract conceptual language ("cellular memory," "reality rippled," "transformed heart"). The final paragraphs fall into paraphrase loops, restating the thematic conclusion in several ways, which dulls the impact of the final image by over-explaining it. The craft is strong, but lacks concision at the crucial final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless, marked by high information density and evocative, precise imagery ("fog had swallowed entire streets like a living thing," "cracked into spider-web patterns"). The rhythm of the prose is controlled, accelerating during the vision and settling into a quiet cadence at the end. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought figurative language; every sentence serves to build atmosphere and advance the narrative with grace and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery like "quartz eyes, hanging like peculiar fruit." The rhythm is well-paced and sentences are crafted with clarity. The score is held back by a few instances of clichéd phrasing ("trembling not from age but from memory") and a final line about the tools "humming with satisfaction" that tips into sentimentality, slightly softening the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative, with very few wasted words. Sentences like "The juice ran silver down her chin like liquid starlight" are superb. There are a few instances of slightly less sharp phrasing, such as "understanding flooding through her," which feels more conventional than the surrounding prose. However, the overall craft is extremely high, with varied syntax and a strong rhythmic pulse that carries the narrative's dreamlike momentum forward without flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clear, concise, and generally propulsive, with strong word choice. The primary weakness lies in the final two paragraphs, which slip into summary. Lines like "Mira had not come to take from the library but to transform it" restate the thematic resolution that was just dramatized, creating a slight redundancy that softens the landing of an otherwise sharp story.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is consistently striking and purposeful, such as the backdrop waves peeling into "tentacles of canvas." The rhythm is controlled, building a mournful, dreamlike momentum that supports the story's tone perfectly. The final paragraph risks thematic summary but lands as an earned internal realization, maintaining propulsion to the last word.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense with information, and propulsive. Sentences like "some documents existed only in their absence, like shadows cast by objects already removed" establish the story's conceptual core with beautiful clarity. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every description serves to build the world or advance Elara's understanding. The rhythm is controlled and confident, matching the story's tone perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with evocative phrases like "manuscript written in fractures." The rhythm and sentence structure are well-controlled. Minor deductions are for occasional scaffolding ("She understood then that...") and a touch of cliché in the final line ("warm her chest like a second, quieter heart"), which slightly soften the impact of an otherwise masterful execution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, and the syntax varies to match the pacing of the narrative, from the reflective opening to the focused climb and climactic action. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies. Every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or plot, resulting in an economical yet richly textured piece of writing. The figurative language feels earned and integrated, never overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density with vivid, purposeful imagery. However, a few key lines of interiority ("We must conjecture...") read more like abstract philosophical prompts than organic thought, creating a slight register shift. While the piece is free of major loops or overwriting, these moments of thematic assertion feel less crafted than the surrounding descriptive prose, creating a subtle textural inconsistency.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmic, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. The craft is mostly flawless until the final paragraph, which contains the story's most significant flaw: the abstract summary in the last line. A few other minor abstractions ("ambient awareness," "serious playfulness") stand out slightly against the otherwise concrete and sensory language, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Each sentence is meticulously crafted to advance character or atmosphere, with strong verbs and specific, evocative imagery ("patient architecture of barnacles building their calcium cities"). The piece is free of cliché, scaffolding, or overwriting, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and highly polished read.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and highly efficient, with nearly every sentence doing double duty for character, setting, and theme. The density of figurative language ("frost made of whispers," "liquid starlight") is high but remains coherent and purposeful, serving to describe a truly ineffable experience. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively, mirroring the story's shift from quiet anticipation to the "stomach-dropping suddenness" of the inversion and the wonder that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Rhythmic control is superb, modulating to fit the gondola's serene passage. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as navigating the terraces "like a musician reading sheet music." The piece is free of line-level artifacts, achieving a polished, professional finish.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it occasionally slips into overwriting with stacked descriptors ("kaleidoscopic waterfall," "rainbow fractals," "prismatic cascade"). The primary weakness is redundancy in the final paragraphs, which restate the central thematic discovery multiple times. This paraphrase loop dulls the impact of the closure, summarizing what the preceding scene had already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is generally elegant and precise, with high information density. However, the story suffers from a recurring structural tic in its prose—the use of "This was the method," "This was why," and "This was her purpose now." This template cadence functions as authorial scaffolding to explain the theme, slightly flattening the prose and momentarily pulling the reader out of the immersive voice.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely luminous and precise, especially in its descriptions of the cavern. However, the final few paragraphs slip into slightly more generic, abstract language ("her own transformed understanding," "In the shadowseam between loss and discovery"). This summary-like scaffolding slightly dulls the immediacy of the otherwise powerful final image, preventing the prose from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm and imagery ("the first yawn of evening stretched golden shadows"). Sentences are dense with meaning, effectively building atmosphere while advancing the narrative. While the language is consistently elevated, it largely avoids overwriting and serves the story's somber, reflective tone without drawing undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lyrical and demonstrates high information density, with evocative and specific imagery throughout. The piece is largely free of artifacts, maintaining momentum and clarity. A few minor phrases, such as "factually mystical energy," contain a slight awkwardness that momentarily disrupts the otherwise seamless and elevated prose, preventing a top-tier score but not significantly marring the overall effect.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. The metaphors are consistently strong and integrated ("archaeology to heal," "spirits released from bondage"). The piece avoids all common prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding. The only minor weakness is a slight drift towards telling in the final paragraphs, where the prose summarizes the thematic takeaway instead of letting the final images do all the work. It’s a strategic choice that slightly lessens the impact, keeping it just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clear, concise, and maintains strong forward momentum. The line-level craft produces evocative images like the "auric lagoon" and the key's "worn smooth" teeth. The piece is slightly marred by a few tired metaphors ("unraveling like poorly woven cloth," "spread like wildfire") that feel out of place amidst the otherwise sharp and specific language.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, evocative, and consistently precise, with high information content in every sentence. Figurative language, such as the prophecy's edges "blurring like watercolors in rain," is both beautiful and functional. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the syntax and rhythm modulate perfectly to match the story's quiet, deliberate momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with striking images like a bell "made of starlight." However, there are minor artifacts that prevent a higher score, such as the slightly overwrought "delicate fractals of emerald joy." The final paragraph resorts to some summary ("She had become what she was always meant to be...") and a list-like description of her new roles, which slightly diminishes the immediacy of the otherwise powerful closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, rhythmic variation, and precise, evocative language. Sentences like "rust loved and precision hated" achieve a poetic concision without sacrificing clarity. The prose is clean, free of scaffolding or redundancy, and propels the narrative forward with a quiet, confident momentum that is perfectly calibrated to the story's contemplative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with a high density of purposeful imagery and a controlled rhythm. Sentences like the opening description of the foundry are masterful. The score is held back slightly by a few phrases that feel overly literary in dialogue and a final paragraph that restates the story's achievements rather than letting the final image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, with many lines serving character, setting, and plot simultaneously. The rhythm is controlled, shifting gracefully with the scene's emotional beats. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding. The writing is highly polished, with only a few instances of dense figurative language that border on being overwritten but never cross the line into obscuring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Line-level craft is very high, particularly in the opening paragraphs. A minor deduction is applied for the repeated "mathematics of X" phrasing, which, while central to the theme, begins to feel like a recurring scaffold that slightly over-explains the core metaphor in the story's second half.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density. Sentences are crafted with care and rhythm. However, for a flawless rating, a few phrases like "understanding flooding through her" and the repetition of "elusively tangible" feel slightly familiar. These are minor slips, but in a piece aiming for the highest echelon, they prevent a top-tier score by momentarily softening the prose's sharp edge.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Images like the "dying wasp trapped in glass" and "pages yellow as old teeth" are vivid and precise. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, and the rhythm of the sentences effectively carries the story's momentum from investigation to quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, with precise word choice and a varied, controlled rhythm. Information density is high, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. While the density of figurative language is very high, it is consistent with the story's voice and fantastical premise. The only minor weakness is the slight turn toward exposition in the final paragraph, which breaks from the preceding "show, don't tell" discipline.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and highly effective. Figurative language, such as the shard catching light "like frozen tears" or time flowing in "ribbons of amber light," is both beautiful and functional. Sentences are crafted with a clear sense of rhythm and purpose, achieving high information density without feeling overwritten. The line-level execution is consistently strong, supporting the story's ambitious concepts and emotional depth without a single misstep.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and generally effective, with strong conceptual imagery like "midnight itself grew teeth." Momentum is well-maintained throughout the short piece. However, several moments rely on common similes ("dissolved like sugar in rain," "opened like a flower") that soften the impact of otherwise original ideas. The writing is polished and professional but stops short of being truly exceptional due to these occasional dips into conventional phrasing, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, particularly in its descriptions. However, the climactic realization contains a small block of summary that tells the reader what Vera understands ("The Hartley expedition hadn't vanished—they had simply walked through..."). While efficient, this moment of direct explanation slightly lessens the immediacy of an otherwise powerful epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with high information density in its imagery. However, momentum is occasionally stalled by sentences that state abstract principles rather than dramatizing them through action or sensory detail. The paragraph explaining her carving method ("This was how to scaffold...") functions as authorial scaffolding, telling the reader the theme directly instead of letting the scene work show it.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with a high density of purposeful imagery. Sentences are beautifully constructed and rhythmically controlled. The only minor weakness is in the final two paragraphs, which contain a slight over-abundance of resonant phrases ("dawning hush," "soft as petals," "patient as the moon") that, while beautiful, verge on summarizing the thematic feeling rather than letting the final image do the work alone. It’s a hairline slip in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and carries a high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentences like "The obsidian lagoon reflected the zeppelin above, creating an infinity of floating libraries" are visually and conceptually stunning. There is a slight redundancy in the final two paragraphs' thematic summations, which could be condensed for an even sharper landing, but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and evocative, with high information density and strong momentum. Phrasing like "windows dark as dead eyes" and "the slow drain of hope" creates a powerful atmosphere without overwriting. There are no notable text artifacts, loops, or scaffolding. The sentences are well-structured and rhythmically varied, creating a polished and professional piece of writing that reads flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and clear, with strong rhythm and precise word choice ("a sound like breaking teeth," "sweetness a kind of vocabulary for hope"). Sentences are varied and propulsive, carrying significant emotional and informational weight without any noticeable overwriting, loops, or scaffolding. The craftsmanship is clean and highly effective from the opening line to the resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Word choices like "sublime," "indefinite," and "recursive" are precise and evocative. Sentence structures vary to create a rhythm that is both majestic and urgent, mirroring Mira's "furiously tranquil" state. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the advancement of the ritual. The figurative language (time as "velvet worn smooth") is fresh and perfectly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the setup. Sentences like "storms spoke in whispers before they screamed" are memorable and efficient. The score is held back slightly by the final paragraph, where the prose shifts from showing to telling, summarizing the story’s meaning rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and often beautiful, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm is controlled, shifting gracefully from description to internal reflection. The piece is held back from the highest tier by a slight tendency toward abstract nouns in key moments and a final paragraph that feels slightly more summary than scene, explaining the transformation rather than leaving it purely embodied in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and precise, with imagery that is both beautiful and functional. Sentences are crafted for rhythmic effect without sacrificing clarity or momentum. There is a near-total absence of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line serves multiple purposes. The language is the story’s strongest asset, creating a powerful, immersive experience.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, particularly in its opening and descriptive passages. However, it sometimes drifts into conceptual abstraction where concrete sensation would be more powerful, such as explaining "The Universe's accounting system." The final two paragraphs, while providing closure, rely too heavily on summarizing the story's themes, which slightly dulls the momentum and immediacy of Marcus's final decision.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, the figurative language is occasionally overwrought, such as the cliché "like a breaking heartstring," which feels out of step with the otherwise fresh imagery. The final sentence, while thematically conclusive, reads more like an aphorism than an organic conclusion to the scene, a slight misstep in an otherwise beautifully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and precise from the opening sentence. Figurative language, such as "salt spray on a windless day," is both original and functionally evocative. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to build the intricate world and advance Mira's internal state with unwavering clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, concise, and often beautiful, with high information density. However, a few minor artifacts slightly dull the finish, such as stock phrases ("surgical precision," "brilliant and impossible"). More critically, the final paragraphs contain moments of thematic summary that read more like an authorial conclusion than a character's raw realization, slightly flattening the prose's momentum at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and a complete absence of scaffolding or cliché. Word choice is precise and evocative ("forget-me-spite," "calcium embrace"), creating a prose that is both beautiful and propulsive. The rhythm of the sentences expertly matches the story's solemn, deliberate pace, demonstrating a rare level of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is evocative and concise, with strong imagery and rhythmic control ("tower-stacks of crushed automobiles," "meaning pressed directly into her mind"). The momentum is excellent throughout the journey. The final paragraph contains a slight redundancy, restating the thematic concept of translating distance into closeness immediately after the child's dialogue has already made the point, which momentarily slows the otherwise powerful cadence of the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with high information density and evocative imagery ("pulled thin like taffy," "swimmers through honey"). There are no significant loops or scaffolding issues. The only slight weakness is a minor register drift in the penultimate paragraph, where the language becomes slightly more abstract and declarative ("to transform isolation into a lighthouse, confusion into exploration") than the concrete, sensory prose that precedes it. This minor slip is the only thing holding it back from a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language is fresh and tonally consistent ("voice like wind through icicles"). The piece is almost entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, resulting in a tight, propulsive read that feels both lyrical and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and possesses a high information density, with nearly every sentence contributing to character, atmosphere, and theme. Phrasing like "ghosts of legislation that would never pass" and "Their luminous absence spoke louder than their presence ever could" demonstrates exceptional line-level craft. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the syntax varies to create a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through this quiet, internal story with undeniable momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise, and the sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm that carries the story's quiet, magical tone. The piece is remarkably free of scaffolding or redundancy; nearly every line serves to deepen character, advance the internal plot, or enrich the atmosphere. The figurative language, such as "possibility, hidden in the mountain's bones," is elevated yet perfectly integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is frequently stunning, especially in its evocative descriptions of the frozen village. However, the craft falters at the climax, where the language shifts from concrete, sensory detail to abstract summary. This pivot to telling ("he finally forgave himself—not because his error didn't matter, but because...") dulls the impact of the resolution, sacrificing immediacy for explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and polished, with strong imagery and rhythm ("like accusations," "flame through dry kindling"). However, there are moments where abstract summary replaces concrete action, particularly when describing the Silencers' ideology ("their crushing unity of permitted thought"). This tendency to tell, while efficient, slightly dulls the immediacy of key conceptual shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. However, at peak moments of tension, the figurative language can become slightly overwrought, momentarily slowing the pace. The description of time as "compressed into the space between breaths held underwater..." is a powerful image but its syntactic complexity feels at odds with the immediate physical peril. This tendency toward ornate prose in moments requiring stark clarity is a minor but noticeable friction.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("spider-webbing across Marina's reflection"). The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for reflection and moving cleanly through discovery. While a few phrases verge on generic summary, the overall line-level craft is of a very high standard, culminating in a resonant final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is frequently stunning, particularly in its sensory details and opening image. However, a few key phrases are repeated ("screaming tenderness") or lean into abstraction ("luminous with protective love, fractured by guilt"), creating minor artifacts that slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft in peak beats. These moments of overwriting prevent an otherwise excellent piece from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with every sentence carrying weight. Phrasing like "the geography of loss" and "vast indifference that had swallowed whole cities" is evocative without being overwritten. There is a slight risk of thematic summary in the line "a patchwork navigator, stitched together from loss and duty," but it functions as a concluding cadence that lands after the emotional climax, confirming an already earned resolution rather than stating an unearned one.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density and striking figurative language ("trees swaying like hanged men"). The piece is impeccably clean, with no wasted words or scaffolding. A minor deduction is made for the penultimate paragraph, where the syntax becomes slightly more explanatory, momentarily slowing the powerful narrative propulsion just before the final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by fresh, precise metaphors ("like trying on wet clothes," "probes for cavities") and a controlled, evocative rhythm. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; the prose is dense with meaning and momentum. The opening and closing lines are particularly strong, framing the narrative with poetic force.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Figurative language, such as the promise being "sharp as broken glass," is precise and powerful. There are no technical flaws, loops, or overwriting, resulting in a clean and propulsive read that meets the 9+ quick test for clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with striking images like "starlight bleeding through stone" and "roses bloomed backwards into buds." However, there are occasional moments of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly too dense, such as "crystallized into eternal monuments to some ancient burning." While the line-level craft is very high, a final pass for concision in its most lush descriptions would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with meaning, particularly in its imagery. However, a few phrases slightly mar the perfection by shifting from showing to telling. Lines like "directed spontaneity" and "scientifically romantic in the truest sense" function as authorial labels summarizing an effect, rather than purely embodying it. While minor, these moments momentarily break the immersive quality of an otherwise stellar piece.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate, with high information density and a varied, poetic rhythm that supports the story's tone and momentum. The opening sentence's syntactical tangle ("written... would write... had written") is a brilliant encapsulation of the core conflict. The line-level craft is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating a rare level of polish and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density. However, the penultimate paragraph contains a moment of abstract summary that reads like scaffolding. The list-like structure ("reading the stories... mapping emotional terrain... finding the human...") feels less embodied than the rest of the narrative. It's a slight dip in an otherwise impeccable line-level execution, momentarily replacing propulsion with reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and economical, with high information density in every line. Figurative language ("frost on glass," "liquid starlight") is fresh and perfectly integrated, enhancing rather than cluttering the narrative. The sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the scene's momentum, from the suspended stillness of the opening to the compressed urgency of the held breath. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding until the final two sentences, which read as a minor summary artifact, slightly dulling the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and propulsive for most of the story. A prose artifact appears in the final paragraph, where a repetitive sentence structure ("Sometimes...") creates a template cadence. This, combined with a stack of metaphors, slightly dulls the closure's impact by shifting from dramatization to summary.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly efficient, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. Word choice is precise and evocative ("resounding hush," "wanderingly exact precision"), creating a powerful atmosphere. There are no notable loops, redundancies, or scaffolding; the line-level craft propels the abstract narrative forward with confidence and clarity, though a handful of phrases lean heavily into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with no wasted words or line-level artifacts. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful, such as the fjord holding a reflection "like mercury in a basin." The sentence structure varies to create a hypnotic rhythm that supports the countdown, demonstrating a high degree of technical mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and often lyrical, especially in its descriptions of the environment ("glowed like a constellation beneath the earth"). There is a high information density in most lines. Minor weaknesses include a few instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("consuming old certainties with its patient heat") and a near-paraphrase loop between "transforming them into bridges" and "boundaries don't have to be barriers," which creates slight redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, precise, and evocative, with high information density and a controlled, lyrical rhythm. Phrasing like "rivulets trace equations she'd never solve" and "clover in late summer, beautiful but knowing winter was coming" demonstrates masterful craft. There are no loops or syntactic ruts. The piece is exceptionally clean and polished, with every sentence working to advance the story's accumulative, textural goal.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Sentences like "the subway's third rail sang its loneliest frequency" are superb. The primary weakness is a small number of phrases that feel more like scaffolding than finished prose, particularly the paragraph explaining his "method." It summarizes his project in a way that slightly stalls the forward momentum of the scene, telling what the rest of the story shows so effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and a controlled, evocative rhythm. Figurative language is strong and purposeful, like the wisteria as "purple waterfalls." There is a slight tendency toward summary in a few key moments, such as describing the climax as preserving "both truth and mercy," which momentarily flattens the nuance. This is a very minor issue that just barely keeps the prose from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, concise, and often brilliant, with high information density and evocative imagery ("grin sharp enough to cut glass"). The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled to match the scene's quiet tension. The only minor friction comes from a few lines that feel more like thematic assertions than organic prose, such as the direct statement about "the only economy that actually works," which briefly breaks the narrative spell.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is elegant and precise, with a high density of vivid, original imagery that rarely feels overwrought. Sentences are rhythmically controlled, creating a hypnotic momentum that suits the accumulative structure. While the prose is consistently elevated, a few more moments of plainer language might have provided dynamic contrast, but this is a minor observation in an otherwise beautifully written piece.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly effective, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("constellations of data," "raw manuscript of spacetime"). The rhythm and pacing are excellent. A slight flaw appears in the line "The anomaly pulsed once, as if in approval," which injects a moment of simplistic anthropomorphism into an otherwise complex and mysterious cosmic force, slightly dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—precise, evocative, and free of artifacts. Sentences like "The harbor glowed like spilled mercury under the moon" and concepts like "a topography of absence" demonstrate exceptional craft. Information density is high, and the rhythm of the prose carries the story's quiet, powerful momentum flawlessly. There is zero scaffolding or redundancy; every word serves a purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with striking phrases like "volcanic tenderness" and "lava cooling into new earth." The line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax and clear momentum. Some minor phrases like "analytically intuitive mind" read as labels, slightly flattening the otherwise sharp execution, but the overall effect is polished and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose demonstrates masterful control, with high information density and evocative, precise language. There is a complete absence of the usual prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance the story's momentum and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently strong, concise, and evocative, with high information density. The rhythm and syntax perfectly match the measured pace of the protagonist. A minor flaw appears in the final paragraph, which drifts into abstract summary ("the rhythm of calculated spontaneity, of choosing the perfect moment..."). This moment of telling slightly dulls the otherwise sharp, imagistic prose at the crucial closure point.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, with strong sensory details. However, it is weakened by a tendency to lapse into abstraction and thematic assertion, particularly near the end. The final two paragraphs function more as a summary of meaning than a continuation of the concrete scene, which dulls the impact of the final image and slows the story's momentum at a crucial point.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with high information density in its best moments ("planted forests of second thoughts"). The rhythm is controlled and serves the story's quiet, intense mood. There are, however, minor instances of ornamental phrasing ("worn leather case") and slightly overwrought metaphors ("The cobalt library materialized from the mist... its blue stone walls breathing with an ancient pulse") that, while atmospheric, occasionally slow the propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery ("not emerging but *becoming*"). The primary flaw is a tendency to summarize key emotional beats with abstract phrases rather than grounding them in concrete action or sensation, which slightly dulls the immediacy of the otherwise polished craft.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional, characterized by high information density, precise imagery ("curls of wood falling like a secret"), and a controlled rhythm. Every line serves character, atmosphere, or theme without a wasted word. The final line from the performer—"Tomorrow I will teach you to peel potatoes as if uncovering stars"—is a stunning, memorable exit that encapsulates the story's strange beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most sentences. The prose avoids major artifacts, but there is a recurring pattern of conceptual paraphrase, where similar abstract ideas ("dissolved," "permeability," "fluid") are restated with slightly different phrasing. While not a mechanical loop, this creates a slight drag on momentum in the final third, particularly in the explanatory final paragraph, which feels less propulsive than the potent action preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, particularly in the opening and in the description of Mira’s perception. The sentence-level craft is strong, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction is warranted for the final two paragraphs, where the language becomes slightly more abstract and summative ("something new and more honest had grown") compared to the concrete, imagistic precision of the story's beginning. The final sentence, however, successfully returns to a powerful, specific image.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific, sensory imagery. The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for reflection and quickening slightly during the performance. While largely excellent, the final paragraphs become slightly too explanatory, summarizing the thematic and character shifts ("no longer just a bell ringer but an architect of moments") rather than fully trusting the preceding scene to have done the work.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density. The language is precise and evocative. A minor point of friction is the repetition of the phrase "genuinely artificial." While its first use is brilliant in describing the stencil, its reuse in the final paragraph to describe her hope, though thematically coherent, feels slightly too tidy and self-referential, a small intellectual knot in an otherwise seamless emotional tapestry.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language, such as the "sleeping snake" measuring tape or ink from "carbonized hard drives," is purposeful and world-building, not ornamental. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; the craft is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and often beautiful, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. The sentence "innocence ended not in a single moment but through ten thousand small betrayals" is a highlight. A minor deduction is for the final paragraph, where phrases like "seed of a new kind of wisdom" feel slightly less fresh than the preceding prose, a small stumble at the finish line.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and largely pristine, with high information density. Sentences like "The shadow had been migrating, untethered from physical law, seeking something" are clean and propulsive. A minor weakness is the tendency toward summary in the penultimate paragraph (e.g., "knowing that..."), which slightly shifts from showing to telling at a crucial moment of resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with very high information density. However, a few moments verge on being slightly too explicit in their metaphorical language, such as "each extraction peeling away another layer of deception" followed by "she'd felt her own facades falling away too." While effective, this phrasing is a minor step down from the subtlety demonstrated elsewhere and slightly dulls the moment with over-articulation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density and a varied, poetic rhythm. The figurative language is vivid and largely effective. A minor weakness is the tendency toward conceptual redundancy in the final paragraphs, where the core epiphany is paraphrased across several sentences ("not records of pain but maps of possibility," "a tunnel through which grace might travel"), slightly slowing the momentum of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with figurative language that consistently deepens meaning. Sentences are crafted with a strong rhythmic sense and high information content. A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances of slight filtering or explanation, such as "Vera understood," which momentarily step back from the immersive sensory experience. These are rare and do not detract from the overwhelming quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with strong verbs and striking images. However, a few phrases lean into abstraction where concrete detail would be stronger, such as "swirling around her like smoke made of pure potential." The line revealing the backstory of the "ancient astronomers" feels slightly more like exposition than a lived-in realization. These are minor issues in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and flawlessly executed. There is no overwriting; every figurative piece of language, from "crystallized hope" to "probability pirates," serves to build the world and advance the narrative. The sentence structure varies to create a rhythm that mirrors the story's "fractured lullaby" motif. It demonstrates exceptional clarity and propulsion without a single wasted word or clumsy phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with high information density in its descriptions. However, some paragraphs lean heavily on stacked descriptive clauses, which occasionally risks feeling like a catalog of wonders rather than a lived-in experience. While there are no significant artifacts, a bit more variation in sentence structure and rhythm during the descriptive passages could have enhanced momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and rhythmic, evocative prose. Sentences are constructed with care, creating momentum and atmosphere simultaneously ("mist clung like unspoken prayers," "beard moved like kelp in unfelt currents"). The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, and clutter. While the construction "voice carrying the same...rhythm" and "words carrying that...quality" shows a hint of a preferred sentence template, it's a minor observation in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density ("seraphically mundane," "phantom sensations"). The rhythm is controlled, creating a quiet, haunting momentum. The final paragraphs, however, shift from showing to strategic telling that becomes slightly too explanatory, particularly the story's final sentence. While the craft is strong overall, this move toward abstraction in the final moments slightly dulls the impact of the otherwise concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The rhythm and syntax support the grave, patient tone. A few phrases, such as "honeyed with false warmth" and "perfect composure cracked," lean on familiar constructions, but these minor instances do not detract from the overall high quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and rhythmic, with strong imagery like "white as funeral bones." Momentum is well-maintained through varied sentence structures. The piece loses minor points for occasional sentences that explain rather than show, such as, "The revelation had been delayed by decades of misunderstanding," which summarizes a feeling that the preceding paragraphs had already effectively dramatized through Lena's actions and thoughts.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and dense with meaning, demonstrating high-level craft. However, a few key moments rely on phrases that, while beautiful, feel slightly familiar or clichéd ("cathedral of rust," "wash through her," "space between heartbeats"). These instances are minor but stand out against the otherwise original and specific language, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is fluid and evocative, with high information density in most passages ("ancient language of chlorophyll and root systems"). The sentence and paragraph structure is varied and maintains momentum. A minor weakness is a tendency toward summary in crucial backstory moments and in the final paragraph, which tells the reader the implications ("The Reconstruction would continue, but on terms...") rather than letting the final image carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—controlled, evocative, and efficient. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the story's emotional cadence, from the tightened focus during the panic to the expansive calm of the conclusion. Word choice is consistently precise and sensory, with high information density in every line and a complete absence of scaffolding or redundancy. This is polished, publishable prose.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, but it maintains clarity and propulsion, effectively building the surreal atmosphere. Sentences are crafted with a strong rhythmic awareness, and word choice is consistently precise and evocative. There are no notable instances of overwriting, scaffolding, or repetitive phrasing; the craft is clean and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant, with a strong rhythm and precise word choice. However, the climactic moment of discovery leans heavily on abstract summary rather than concrete, in-the-moment perception. The final paragraph, particularly "She began to disappear into her work, merging with the patterns," feels conceptually vague and less powerful than the sharp, specific imagery of the story's opening. This reliance on telling at the peak moment slightly dulls the otherwise high-quality craft.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with very few wasted words. Figurative language, such as "Alarms sang their crystalline warnings," is consistently integrated with the story's core imagery of ice and cold. There are no notable loops or scaffolding; each sentence effectively carries character, action, or atmosphere, driving the narrative to its sharp, clear conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. However, the momentum is slightly dulled in the final two paragraphs, which shift from the sharp, immediate scene work into a more summative, explanatory mode. This brief lapse into telling what was already powerfully shown is the primary blemish on an otherwise stellar piece of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense with evocative, precise imagery, yet it never feels overwritten because every metaphor and description serves to build the world's logic or advance the scene's momentum. Sentences are crafted with a poet's ear for rhythm and impact, achieving high information density without sacrificing clarity. There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffold phrases; the craft is clean and invisible.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with figurative language that consistently deepens character and theme ("clouds below beginning to glow like old newsprint held to flame"). The rhythm is controlled, sentences are varied, and there are no wasted words or movements. The craft is virtually invisible, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience free of artifacts or awkward phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery. However, a few moments verge on over-articulation, summarizing the theme rather than letting the image do the work (e.g., "guilt transformed into acknowledgment"). This minor tendency toward explicit statement slightly undermines the otherwise potent subtext in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and precise, with vivid imagery and a strong, varied rhythm. Sentences are information-dense without feeling overwritten. While one or two lines in the climax verge on thematic summary ("composting the past"), they function effectively as part of an earned internal epiphany and do not detract from the overall quality.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. Information density is high. A minor weakness lies in a few phrases that feel overly literary or declarative, such as "cradling empathy in arms of steel," which reads more like an author's thematic summary than a character's raw thought. This slightly breaks the otherwise immersive texture of the prose in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and a controlled, poetic rhythm. Figurative language is potent and consistent with the established synesthetic rules, avoiding cliché entirely. Sentences like "possibility always did" demonstrate concision and depth. The prose successfully bears the weight of the story's heady concepts without becoming opaque or overwrought, maintaining momentum through its final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few phrases like "fractally precise" and "impossible geometries" feel slightly generic within the speculative genre. The primary weakness is the final two paragraphs, which shift from showing to telling, summarizing the theme and Maya's emotional state ("Her somatic markers sang with certainty," "Maya's willowglass hope had proven stronger..."). This shift dulls the momentum and impact of the otherwise powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its evocative descriptions of the "factually mystical" science. The sentence structure and rhythm are controlled, accelerating and decelerating to match the story's dreamlike pace. While a few phrases lean towards direct statement (e.g., "Her purpose wasn't mere documentation"), the overall craft is superb and free of any significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong, resonant imagery like light caught like "frozen honey." However, its momentum is occasionally dampened by abstract declarations and a few clichéd phrases ("unravel like thread from a spool"). These instances of telling, rather than showing, slightly dilute the power of an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery like the mist rolling "like a living thing." The rhythm and clarity are high. A minor weakness lies in the final few lines, which lean toward summary ("no longer burned but forged"). While effective, a top-tier publication would likely push for an ending that lands on a more concrete, resonant image rather than an articulation of the character's change.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating exceptional clarity, density, and rhythm. Every sentence serves a purpose, advancing character, atmosphere, or action without a single wasted word or overwrought image. Figurative language, such as promises accumulating "like sediment," is both beautiful and precise. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or prose artifacts; it is a model of concision and evocative power.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong, clear images. Rhythm and syntax are varied to great effect. The score is held back from the highest tier by a single, jarring phrase: "phototropic to kindness." This is a register drift into scientific jargon that clashes with the organic, craft-based lexicon established for the character and story, creating a moment of authorial intrusion in an otherwise immersive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise, sensory imagery ("spilled across the harbor like mercury"). The rhythm is controlled and varied, creating a contemplative momentum. The piece suffers from a few instances of summarizing its own meaning in abstract terms ("literal and metaphorical," "surviving and flourishing"), which momentarily flattens the otherwise concrete and imagistic prose. These are minor but keep it just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, evocative imagery, and a compelling rhythm. Sentences like "The brass sundial caught no shadows in the Tidal Library, where clouds rolled beneath the glass floor like forgotten seas" establish world, tone, and conflict with remarkable efficiency. The prose is clean, with no discernible scaffolding or redundancy, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience from the first line to the last.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high line-level craft, with memorable phrases like "the architecture of longing." The rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, creating a contemplative momentum. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward overwriting; the high density of figurative language, while often beautiful, can occasionally feel layered on too thickly, slightly dulling the impact of individual images.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and generally propulsive, but key discoveries are delivered through summary rather than dramatized scenes. The reveal of the AI's identity ("The charts revealed...") is an info-dump that flattens a pivotal moment of discovery. This strategic telling sacrifices immediacy for narrative speed, a notable flaw in an otherwise solid execution.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and striking imagery ("a geometric wound in the earth"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum, especially during the descent. A minor weakness is a slight reliance on summary in the final paragraph ("Marcus emerged into starlight, transformed"), which tells the change rather than grounding it entirely in a final, concrete image or action.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative for most of the story, with strong verbs and compelling imagery ("public virtue lancing through private vice like light through prisms"). Momentum is excellent. A minor deduction is warranted for the final two paragraphs, where the language becomes slightly redundant and explanatory, a small lapse into telling that slightly dulls the sharpness of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, concise, and propulsive, with strong information density. It avoids significant overwriting or artifacting. However, a few moments rely on slightly stock phrasing ("tinged with the same nervously confident energy") or convenient emotional labeling ("The spongey dread transformed into something else"). These minor slips prevent the piece from achieving perfect line-level mastery but do not impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, with high information density in its descriptions ("pixelated amnesty made tangible," "reality developing like a photograph in reverse"). The figurative language is ambitious and mostly successful, contributing to the story's unique atmosphere without significant overwriting. There are no notable textual artifacts or momentum-killing loops.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise, memorable imagery like the train being "a wound healing over." The rhythm and sentence structure vary effectively to control momentum. The only slight misstep is the final paragraph, which verges on overwriting by summarizing the themes, slightly diminishing the propulsive force and resonant power of the final image. It is a minor flaw in an otherwise beautifully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery ("translucent as stained glass," "sunrise on an airless moon"). However, there is a recurring template cadence ("Each dream held...", "Each variable star spoke...", "Each had drawn...") that feels slightly mechanical and undercuts the otherwise organic rhythm. While possibly intentional, this pattern slightly flattens the prose in the middle section, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless, with evocative and precise imagery ("apple blossoms bloomed and rotted simultaneously"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum effectively. A few phrases in the final paragraph, such as "thawed into liquid truth," feel slightly too neat and lean toward cliché, preventing a perfect score but barely detracting from the overall high quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and dense with striking images. However, the high density of figurative language occasionally tips into overwriting, with a few similes feeling familiar ("like electricity through water"). While the rhythm and flow are generally excellent, a stricter editorial eye would trim some of the more ornate phrases to let the strongest images—like the scars in the air—land with even greater force. The line-level craft is very strong but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and confident, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. There are minor, infrequent instances of near-redundancy, such as describing a touch as "protective and soft simultaneously" after already calling it "fiercely gentle." These are hairline slips in an otherwise polished piece and do not obscure clarity or harm the powerful momentum of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propelled by strong, specific verbs and evocative imagery. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. Figurative language, such as the water-filled pit reflecting nothing back, is purposeful and powerful. The read-aloud quality is excellent, with varied sentence structures creating a rhythm that mirrors Marcus's shifting internal state from detached analysis to emotional immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density. Lines like "metallic trees bore fruits of pure understanding" are evocative and efficient. The piece avoids clutter and maintains momentum. A few moments lean towards abstraction, such as "flooding her nervous system with patterns of pure information," where a more embodied description could have heightened the impact, but these are minor slips in otherwise polished prose.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the final few paragraphs contain some conceptual redundancy ("This was her gift...", "This was enough...", "This was her work..."). This pattern of summarizing the thematic takeaway creates a slight drag on momentum right at the close, a minor scaffolding that keeps an otherwise excellent piece from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clear, concise, and maintains momentum. However, the final two paragraphs contain prose artifacts in the form of conceptual loops, restating the theme and Crown’s motives multiple times. This summary dulls the impact of the closing image and feels less crafted than the sharp, evocative prose of the story's first half.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and dense with purpose. However, the final paragraph lapses slightly into summary and abstraction ("not seeking absolution in data, but accepting that some things...must simply be allowed to flow"). This move toward telling what has already been powerfully shown in the preceding beat slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. The sentence structure is varied, the rhythm is controlled, and figurative language is used effectively to build atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The line-level craft is exceptionally clean, with no significant loops or scaffolding, propelling the narrative with a sense of deliberate grace that matches the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose demonstrates high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, rarely straying into overwriting. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, and the final paragraph brings motifs together with precision and power, showcasing a command of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. The highly figurative language is not an indulgence but a core component of the world-building and atmosphere, executed without a single mixed metaphor or clunky phrase. Every sentence propels the narrative forward while deepening the story's unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong rhythm and high information density. Lines like "Shadows pooled in its recesses with the quality of aged wine" are vivid and purposeful. There is a slight tendency toward abstract lyricism ("softer than memory") and a moment of near-thematic summary in the final third ("Contentment wasn't something to find but something to become..."), which slightly tempers the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic. Line-level craft is exceptionally high, with strong verbs and evocative, purposeful metaphors. The only minor flaw is a slight tendency toward thematic recapitulation in the final two paragraphs. The phrasing "not answers, but better questions. Not absolution, but the terrible gift..." restates what the preceding scene has already dramatized with more power, creating a minor redundancy that softens the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, with lines often performing multiple functions. The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for introspection and maintaining a quiet tension. While the figurative language is dense ("sycamore hush," "cells remembering tomorrow"), it remains coherent and serves the story's speculative, lyrical tone without becoming overwrought or obscuring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Lines like "the calcified remains of creatures that had sung themselves to death in pursuit of the perfect resonance" are both beautiful and essential to the world. A brief summary ("First, she had learned... Then... Finally...") is used strategically to compress centuries of development, a choice that serves momentum rather than hindering it. The piece is virtually free of line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its imagery. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful. A minor weakness is a slight tendency toward paraphrase-looping in the final paragraphs, where the core thematic insight is re-articulated multiple times in similar terms, which slightly dulls the sharpness of the otherwise excellent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with many standout phrases. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a density of figurative language that can feel more decorative than functional. The final paragraph also shifts into summary ("she would spend her remaining years teaching others"), which slightly dilutes the powerful immediacy of the closing image and undercuts the principle of showing a new reality rather than outlining it.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with no wasted words or motion. Figurative language, such as "insects in resin" and doubt gnawing "like background radiation," is consistently fresh and purposeful. The sentences have a varied, compelling rhythm that carries the narrative momentum forward gracefully, even in its most reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a compelling rhythm. While mostly concise, a few lines summarize emotional or thematic beats instead of dramatizing them (e.g., "This was the gift hidden in the old reaper's recordings..."). These moments of strategic telling feel slightly less potent than the surrounding 'shown' passages, creating minor drag in an otherwise propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative from the first sentence. The language is dense with purpose, with nearly every line advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. There are no notable line-level artifacts or clumsy constructions. The score is slightly limited by the final paragraphs, where the prose shifts from showing to summarizing, losing some of its propulsive momentum in favor of thematic explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, confident, and demonstrates high information density with striking imagery ("memory pooled like standing water"). The rhythm is controlled, building a melancholic, watchful momentum. A single sentence summarizing Marcus's new purpose ("But his true work was this...") reads as a minor piece of scaffolding in an otherwise seamlessly constructed narrative, holding the score back from a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density and strong imagery ("cursive mathematics," "breathing geometry"). However, a few moments in the final third slip from showing into telling, summarizing the epiphany's meaning rather than letting the action and images carry the full weight. For example, the line "Her final transformation... wouldn't diminish her humanity—it would complete it" is an unnecessary explication.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative without a wasted word. Information density is high, with sentences that simultaneously build character, world, and tension. The rhythm is controlled, accelerating during the tense exchange and settling into a resonant stillness at the end, demonstrating masterful line-level craft with no discernible artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, concise, and highly effective, with strong momentum and information density. Sentence structure varies appropriately, and the language is precise without being ornate. There are no significant loops or scaffolding. The piece demonstrates professional-level control, with its clarity and directness serving as a strength that supports the story's conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and evocative imagery ("whisper of paper against brass," "storm-born silence"). The rhythm is controlled and supports the magical realist tone. A minor, repeated sentence structure ("She understood," "She'd built," "She recognized") creates a slight template cadence in the first half, a small friction in an otherwise excellent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with precise, evocative language and a confident rhythm. Sentences like the one describing happiness ground into "dust so fine it slipped through every attempt to gather it back" are exceptional. The score is held back slightly by the final paragraphs, which shift from showing to strategic telling, summarizing the theme in a way that slightly lessens the punch of the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative figurative language. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Lines like "Words had become foreign architecture in her mouth" showcase a rare level of craft and elegance, making the story a pleasure to read.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean, vivid, and carries good momentum. However, it is weakened by several instances of telling over showing, particularly when articulating the story's theme. The final sentence, "The frozen bloom of his potential had finally thawed," is an overwrought metaphor that summarizes his internal change rather than letting the image of him holding the new staff convey it. Some stock phrases ("struck him like lightning," "the penny dropping") also slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is luminous and precise for most of the story, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, the final paragraph contains scaffolding ("But she'd already decided to tune her life differently, to teach others...") that summarizes intent rather than dramatizing it. This, combined with the conceptual loop between the last two sentences, slightly dulls the otherwise sharp closure.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. Sentences like "clocks run sideways and time folds into itself" establish the tone and world with masterful efficiency. The piece suffers from a few instances of slight overwriting where abstract nouns ("pure possibility") are used in place of more concrete imagery, and some phrasing ("resiliently positive nature undimmed") feels more like summary than dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with a rhythm that supports the story's deliberate, focused atmosphere. The sentence-level craft is strong, effectively balancing complex ideas with vivid imagery. The primary flaw is a minor reliance on abstract nouns ("connection," "perception," "certainty") and the repetition of the key thematic phrase, which, while potentially a deliberate refrain, functions as a minor paraphrase loop that slightly impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often evocative, with strong imagery like "bioluminescent pearls" and "whale song filtered through crystals." Momentum is well-maintained through concise, purposeful sentences. There are, however, a few instances of slightly generic phrasing ("unfolded horizons," "infinite sea") that rely on abstraction rather than the story's otherwise potent specificity, keeping the prose just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is strong, characterized by evocative imagery and a confident rhythm, with no significant prose artifacts or loops. Sentences are dense with information and atmosphere. The piece is held back from a higher score only by the final paragraph, which shifts from showing to telling in a way that feels less elegant than the preceding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative from the first sentence to the last. Figurative language is strong and purposeful, such as the cables as "neural pathways" and the corridors as a "throat swallowing her." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line carries weight and propels the narrative forward with a controlled, poetic momentum that enhances the story's atmosphere of "crashing hush."

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong imagery. However, a few phrases lean into well-worn territory ("cascading like snowfall," "cupped palm holding stars") or state what could be implied ("Now it served as his anchor"). The line "Wisdom earned through error, just like his entire situation" is a piece of scaffolding that slightly dulls the momentum by summarizing the theme too directly.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. Figurative language is fresh and integral to the story's meaning, never merely decorative (e.g., "crack... like a frozen scream," "consonants softening like worn stone"). The prose is free of artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a rare level of polish and confidence from the first sentence to the last.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is largely clear, concise, and excels in its sensory descriptions of the otherworldly garden. The rhythm is well-paced, and sentences are generally well-constructed without significant loops or artifacts. The piece loses some sharpness in moments of conceptual explanation, especially the final paragraph, which shifts from evocative imagery to abstract summary.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with evocative and precise language throughout. Sentences are rhythmically varied and propel the narrative forward with grace. There are a few moments where the figurative language becomes slightly dense, as in "The world's tarnished wonder caught fire in her strings," but these are minor issues in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece of prose with zero technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in phrases like "cobalt cathedral of broken promises" and "mechanical ballet." The rhythm is controlled and confident. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraphs, which slightly lose momentum by shifting from showing to summarizing the thematic takeaway, a small piece of scaffolding that could have been removed to let the final image stand alone.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are constructed with rhythmic care, creating a propulsive yet dreamlike momentum. While the density of figurative language occasionally borders on the ornate, the clarity and emotional impact are maintained throughout, with no significant artifacts or loops to impede the story's flow.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with a strong, controlled rhythm. However, a few moments dip into slightly overwrought phrasing that is common to this type of literary fantasy (e.g., "equations bloomed into verse and theorems sang," "journals...whispered formulas"). While these instances are minor and don't stall momentum, they represent a small lapse in an otherwise impeccable line-level craft, preventing a higher score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and strong rhythmic control, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The language is precise and evocative, creating a powerful sense of place and mood without overwriting. A minor deduction is applied for the final paragraph, where phrases like "She had given the dream what it truly needed" function as strategic telling that slightly summarizes the resolution rather than letting the preceding action carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("supernova compressed into a whisper"). The rhythm and syntax are varied and support the story's momentum without any technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding. A handful of phrases lean towards grand abstraction ("hush of cosmic possibility"), slightly diminishing the otherwise sharp, tactile specificity of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative from the first sentence. The language is precise and the rhythm is controlled, particularly in the descriptive passages. The only slight weakness is in the final paragraph, where the prose shifts from imagistic conclusion to a more summary-like mode of explaining Margaret's future intentions. This minor shift slightly dulls the sharpness of an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density. Phrases like "sharp-edged with fresh grief" and "rust on iron" are specific and evocative. The piece avoids clutter and maintains strong momentum. A minor deduction is for a few phrases that feel slightly overwrought, such as "an act of love disguised as mathematics," which pulls the reader out momentarily with its self-conscious poignancy. Overall, the line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with powerful images like light spilling "like honey." The line-level craft is strong, though a few instances of abstract labeling ("insatiably creative mind," "blessed by use and understanding") slightly blunt the specificity. While there are no major artifacts, a final polish to ground these abstractions would bring it to an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and striking imagery. Momentum is well-maintained, and the rhythm of the language supports the tone. A few phrases, such as the explanation of the "interlaced hush," lean slightly more toward direct authorial summary than embodied experience, a minor artifact in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly effective, with strong verbs and evocative, specific imagery. Sentences are well-constructed, creating a rhythm that supports the story's contemplative and mysterious atmosphere. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency toward summary in the final paragraphs, where a few phrases explicitly state the thematic conclusion rather than allowing the final actions to carry the full weight of meaning, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and frequently stunning, with high information density and evocative imagery ("darkness thick as centuries"). However, the final few paragraphs, while thematically resonant, contain sentences that become slightly overwrought with abstraction ("the sophisticated melancholy of understanding that preservation and release are the same motion"). This minor register drift into the philosophical summary slightly dulls the impact of the concrete images carrying the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative from the first sentence to the last. Word choice is precise and imaginative ("binary to botanical," "elastic moment"), creating vivid imagery with remarkable economy. There are no wasted words, scaffold phrases, or rhythmic loops; every sentence works to advance atmosphere, character, or plot. The writing is of a caliber ready for immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density through most of the piece. The craft falters slightly in the last two paragraphs, which shift from evocative imagery to summary-telling, creating a prose artifact that dulls the otherwise sharp closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and precise, with almost no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language, such as "clouds drift past like thoughts made visible" and the "spooled wholeness" of the storm, is both original and purposeful. The sentences have a varied, compelling rhythm that carries the story's momentum effortlessly. There are no discernible loops or artifacts; the craft is clean and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story. However, several key moments rely on abstract summary over concrete dramatization (e.g., "The portrait she crafted wasn't visual but spatial"). The final paragraph, in particular, becomes a cascade of abstractions ("memory and light," "truth," "touching and knowing") that slightly dilutes the powerful, concrete imagery that preceded it.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful. However, the final two paragraphs lose some momentum by shifting from showing to summarizing the meaning of Elara's discovery. Lines like "The Guild would call this her great discovery, but Elara knew better" function as scaffolding, slightly dulling the impact of the otherwise powerful final image by over-explaining its significance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and evocative, specific imagery ("brown as driftwood worn smooth by endless tides"). However, the piece is weakened by a few key sentences in the penultimate paragraphs that explicitly summarize the theme. This lapse into telling what has already been powerfully shown acts as scaffolding that should have been removed, momentarily stalling the story's momentum just before its conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, concise, and often elegant, with strong images like "despair made visible" and "brambled hope." The sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward without significant overwriting or scaffolding. The piece avoids major line-level artifacts, but lacks the consistent, high-density invention and rhythmic variety needed to push it into the highest echelon of pure craft.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can feel strenuous ("flooding through him like electricity through water"). Some phrases lean towards cliché ("spider-webbed with cracks") or didacticism ("beautiful because they told the truth about breaking"), which slightly tempers the otherwise excellent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, controlled, and highly effective, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Information density is high, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. The piece is held back from perfection only by a few instances of slightly less sharp phrasing, such as the common pairing "delicate and deadly," which momentarily pulls back from the otherwise fresh language.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is dense with meaning, with sentences that are both lyrical and precise ("hurt polymerized into distance"). The central metaphors are extended without strain, and the syntax shifts to match the story's emotional cadence. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line contributes to momentum and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with a high density of evocative imagery that rarely feels overwritten. Lines like "quantifying absence by the spaces between them" demonstrate exceptional craft. A minor deduction is warranted for a few phrases that lean toward familiar abstraction ("eyes that held infinite possibility"), but these are isolated slips that do not affect the powerful momentum or clarity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is frequently beautiful, with evocative and precise figurative language. However, the story's momentum is hampered by a heavy reliance on exposition to establish the world's rules and history, exceeding the standard allowance for reflection. This front-loading of information, while clear, replaces the tension of discovery with summary, slightly dulling the propulsion toward the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often evocative and imagistically rich ("arc painting time signatures in the air"). However, it occasionally slips into cliché ("drawing poison from a wound") or overly abstract summary ("different expressions of the same cosmic dance"). The final paragraphs become less imagistic and more declarative, which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is mostly elegant and precise, but the prose is burdened by a recurring conceptual loop. The idea of "abandoned dreams/aspirations" is restated in multiple forms ("graveyard of military ambitions," "forgotten aspirations," "dreams that had been abandoned," "library of unfinished thoughts"), which slightly dulls momentum rather than deepening it. This thematic redundancy is the primary flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward with a controlled rhythm. While the lexicon is rich, there are moments where a high concentration of conceptual jargon ("prism-minded," "threshold effects," "seeds of vigilance") feels slightly overwrought, but it doesn't break clarity or harm the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with phrases like "crystallized vibrations" and "acoustic architecture" demonstrating high craft. Momentum is well-maintained. The score is capped just below the highest tier due to a few instances of thematic labeling that feel slightly less organic than the surrounding prose, such as stating "Mira's empathy in motion guided her movements" rather than letting the action carry the meaning alone.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating both precision and elegance from the first sentence to the last. Information density is high, with every line advancing character, atmosphere, or theme without a single wasted word or overwrought phrase. The sentence structure has a controlled, meditative rhythm that mirrors the game of chess itself, accelerating and decelerating with the emotional beats of the story. There are no discernible prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Figurative language, such as "starlight like scattered coins" and "static crackled like distant applause," is effective and integrated. There is a slight tendency toward summary and abstraction in the final two paragraphs, where the prose shifts from embodying the moment to explaining its significance, which slightly dulls the momentum of the otherwise excellent line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, with a rhythm that supports the story's meditative pace. However, a few key moments resort to academic or abstract language ("olfactorily sensitive nature," "liminal moment") where more concrete, sensory description would have been more powerful. These instances are infrequent but occur at pivotal beats, slightly flattening their impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. The sentence structure varies effectively to control rhythm and momentum, and there are no discernible loops, artifacts, or overwriting. The language choices consistently serve to build the unique atmosphere of Verdance without drawing undue attention to themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with a high information density that makes every sentence work. Figurative language is used sparingly but with surgical precision, as in the "steel flowers" image. The writing is free of loops, scaffolding, or overwriting, demonstrating a rare level of polish and control that elevates the entire narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with dense, evocative imagery and a poetic rhythm that propels the narrative forward. There are no wasted words, technical flaws, or overwrought passages; every sentence serves the story's aesthetic and narrative purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptional quality: dense, precise, and resonant. Figurative language, such as "whispers...seep through like smoke through gauze" and the silence that "seemed to press against her eardrums," is both original and effective. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to momentum, character, or atmosphere, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful. Sentences are crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. While the figurative language is very rich ("grief multiplied by infinity," "sorrow tasted like metal and ozone"), it remains coherent with the established voice. A slight deduction is warranted because the sheer density occasionally verges on feeling overwrought, a high-wire act that risks prioritizing concept over embodied feeling in a few moments.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise, memorable imagery ("spine of ancient stone," "collapsed centuries into heartbeats"). The rhythm and momentum are excellent. A minor flaw is a tendency toward summary in the closing paragraphs. The line "On the path ahead, she could already sense the next relic calling, waiting to transform routine into revelation" restates the story's thematic arc directly, slightly dulling the impact of the otherwise powerful final images.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong imagery like "crystallized breath" and "emotional archaeology." Information density is high, and the momentum builds effectively. The score is slightly tempered by a couple of stock phrases in key moments, such as "The revelation struck her with physical force," which momentarily pulls back from the otherwise specific and embodied experience. These are minor but noticeable in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly effective, with strong verbs and evocative, specific imagery. Sentences like "The silence here was different from ordinary quiet—it raveled" demonstrate high-level craft where concept and language are inseparable. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwriting; every line serves to build atmosphere and advance the accumulative pressure toward the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there are moments where it slips from showing into efficient, but less evocative, telling. For instance, "transformed from a record of loss into an instrument of recovery" summarizes the thematic process rather than letting the blade's "awakening" edge demonstrate it. While concise, these abstractions slightly flatten the texture in key transitional moments.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative from the first sentence. Word choice is precise and imaginative ("synesthetic ribbons," "violet whispers," "quantum foam") without becoming overwrought. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the pacing of Kira's journey, creating propulsive momentum without a single wasted word or clunky construction. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative for most of the story. The rhythm and word choice create a powerful sense of place and mood. The final sentence, "their tears falling like sea glass into the waiting ocean," feels like a slightly forced echo of an earlier motif, a bit of overwriting that gilds the lily. This, combined with the thematic summary in the preceding paragraph, slightly dulls the otherwise sharp ending.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propelled by a strong internal rhythm. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, building the world and atmosphere without becoming overwrought. Word choice is precise and evocative ("tumbled out accidentally prophetic," "dawn's first intentions"), and the sentence structure varies to match the ritual's cadence. The piece is free of line-level artifacts and demonstrates masterful craft.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density without feeling cluttered. Figurative language, such as the indigo speaking of "deep ocean trenches," is purposeful and integrated. The sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm, and there are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies. It is polished, professional, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate: dense, precise, and resonant. Every sentence serves a purpose, advancing plot, character, or atmosphere without a single wasted word. Lines like "solving for x where x equals the weight of absence" demonstrate a rare fusion of conceptual depth and poetic clarity. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting to be found.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and propulsive from the first sentence to the last. Figurative language is consistently original and precise ("unraveling like a poorly-knitted shroud"), enhancing meaning without ever feeling overwrought. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or action. The piece demonstrates a rare level of line-level craft and polish.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, confident, and often beautiful, with high information density. The rhythm is well-controlled, creating a sense of "enlarged tranquility" that matches the tone. There are no significant artifacts or loops. The score is held back slightly by a few moments that rely on familiar phrasing ("feeling her guilt as a physical weight in his chest") or conceptual labels ("his gift and curse intertwined") where more specific, surprising imagery could have elevated the lines further.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, resonant imagery, and a confident, poised rhythm. Sentences like "The bread appeared every Tuesday morning...smelling of rosemary and time" establish mood, mystery, and sensory detail with remarkable economy. The prose is almost flawless, though a phrase like "the universe practiced a heuristic kindness" momentarily adopts a more abstract, analytical register than the rest of the grounded, perceptual narration.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are constructed with a clear sense of rhythm and momentum. There are a few moments where the figurative language feels slightly familiar ("blazed bright," "blood from stone"), which keeps it just shy of perfection. However, the overall execution is superb, particularly the use of recurring sensory details like the "quartz hush" to create a cohesive and immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally sharp and evocative, with high information density. However, a few key moments are burdened by overwrought figurative language, such as the slightly muddled "drowning in reverse." Furthermore, the final sentence is a thematic echo that feels less potent than the image preceding it. These minor slips in an otherwise strong performance prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong, specific verbs and evocative sensory language ("copper-sweet magnetic north," "aluminum-sharp southwest"). There are no wasted words or repetitive sentence structures; each line contributes to atmosphere, character, or momentum. Figurative language is fresh and integrated, avoiding cliché and successfully shouldering the high-concept world-building without faltering.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops. The piece is held back from a higher score by a few phrases that lean toward cliché or academic summary ("cracked open with understanding," "rectify the imbalance between memory and imagination"), which momentarily disrupt the otherwise specific and tactile language.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. The line-level craft is exceptional, with only one or two minor instances of functional-but-less-elegant exposition, such as the explanation of the "temperature differential." These are minuscule blemishes on an otherwise polished and highly effective piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is frequently stunning, with precise, evocative language ("a stone finger pointing at eternity"). The piece suffers from minor but noticeable flaws in the final third, including abstract overwriting ("truth dressed in amazement") and some conceptual redundancy that summarizes the successful outcome. These slightly dilute the impact of the otherwise sharp and resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and vivid, specific imagery ("wings of flame that folded inward"). The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the methodical pace of the ritual. The piece avoids nearly all prose artifacts, though a phrase like "a complete incompleteness, a perfect imperfection" borders on the abstract and feels slightly less grounded than the surrounding text. This is a minor point in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often elegant, with strong verbs and selective sensory details. The primary flaw lies in the final paragraph, which contains a paraphrase loop: "...to be still enough to hear what needed hearing, to follow what needed following..." This redundancy, combined with the thematic summary, feels like scaffolding that should have been removed, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp craft of the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the setting and the dance. There are, however, minor instances of cliché ("settled on her shoulders like an old coat found in an attic") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. The sentence-level craft is strong but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is impeccable, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. The prose is clean and propulsive, with sentence structures that modulate to match the story's pacing, from quiet observation to the intensity of discovery. The recurring phrase "gleaming silence" is a purposeful, resonant echo rather than an artifact, linking the sterile chamber to the profound quiet of buried sorrow. There are no notable loops or scaffolding to weaken its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep. Figurative language ("pockets of concentrated quiet that hung in the air like invisible fruit") is both beautiful and precise, enhancing meaning rather than merely decorating the prose. The piece is entirely free of loops, scaffolding, or other artifacts, reading as polished and deliberate from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language, such as meteors tracing "silver threads across darkness," is evocative and purposeful, enhancing the atmosphere without overwriting. There are no notable textual artifacts; the piece demonstrates a clean, professional command of line-level craft from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("dirt collecting under her fingernails like inverse stars"). A minor flaw appears in the final paragraphs, where the language becomes more conceptual and less embodied, creating a slight momentum drag just before the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density in most lines. There are isolated moments where the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought ("understanding flooding through her like aurora light"). The final paragraph contains a summary statement ("honesty sharper than any forged blade") that tells the reader what has already been powerfully shown, a minor flaw in an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, with a strong rhythm and high information density. Sentences are well-crafted and evocative. The primary weakness is a couple of instances of strategic telling that feel more like scaffolding than efficient summary. Phrases such as "The web of intrigue wasn't conspiracy but connection" function as thematic labels that state what the rest of the story shows more gracefully, slightly dulling the prose's otherwise sharp, immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, especially in its descriptions of the shrine and the visions. The rhythm is well-paced and the imagery is precise. The primary weakness lies in the final few paragraphs, which resort to some summary and telling ("The ghosts had chosen their messenger well") where continued showing would have been more powerful, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative sensory details ("rain-scent lifted from the stones"). There are, however, moments where the figurative language becomes slightly too dense or abstract, bordering on overwritten, as in "pulsing with scintillatingly somber rhythm." These instances are minor but momentarily pull focus from the grounded imagery. Overall, the line-level craft is very high, with excellent momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, efficient, and propulsive, with strong verbs and precise imagery ("a crack in reality itself"). The story avoids significant line-level artifacts like loops or scaffolding. A few key moments rely on summary ("He understood now...") where a more embodied or fragmented internal reflection under pressure could have heightened the impact, but the overall craft is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and meticulously crafted, with very high information density in each line. Figurative language, such as "unfurling like smoke through history's lungs," is consistently fresh and purposeful. The sentences have a varied, compelling rhythm that propels the narrative forward without a single wasted word or clunky construction. There are no discernible loops or prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is frequently beautiful and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. At times, however, the density of figurative language borders on overwriting ("positively wistful, like remembering love through frosted glass"). The final paragraphs also rely more on summary than scene, which slightly dulls the momentum at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with striking imagery and a strong, varied rhythm. Sentences like "The fleeting golden sunset painted the drift-ice marina in honey and blood" are powerful and efficient. While the figurative language is consistently high-quality, its sheer density in a few moments approaches the edge of overwriting, a hairline slip that keeps it just shy of the 9+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and evocative imagery. Sentences are concise yet powerful, advancing the story while building a palpable atmosphere. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every word choice feels deliberate and impactful, demonstrating a masterful command of line-level craft from the opening line to the resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and clean, with strong imagery and a confident rhythm. The anaphora ("She saw...") is used effectively to build momentum during the memory sequences. The final paragraphs, however, rely slightly more on summary ("she knew what she had to do") than on dramatized action, which softens the landing of an otherwise sharp and propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density. The rhythm and syntax support the story's quiet, deliberate pace. A minor deduction is warranted for the final two sentences ("Thomas's last gift finally found its purpose..."; "...steady as absolution, sure as grace"), which feel slightly overwritten and summarize the story's meaning rather than letting the final image resonate on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, confident, and dense with meaning, demonstrating excellent rhythmic control and syntactic variety. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a unique texture that supports the story's high-concept premise without becoming opaque. While highly figurative, the language remains coherent and propulsive, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or other line-level artifacts that might impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is remarkably clean, concise, and evocative, with high information density in nearly every sentence. Figurative language, such as the archive as a "graveyard" or the pattern emerging "like a photograph developing in reverse," is precise and powerful. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other prose artifacts, maintaining clear momentum through to the resonant final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often elegant and features strong, memorable imagery, especially in its descriptions of the setting. However, it sometimes drifts into abstraction ("emotional architecture") and relies on telling phrases ("understanding flooding through her") at key moments. There's a slight tendency toward overwriting, with figurative language that feels more decorative than essential, slightly dulling the story's propulsion in places.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of a publishable, literary quality from the opening sentence. Information density is high, and the figurative language is consistently potent and integrated. A hairline deduction is made for the final sentence's articulation of pain's meaning, which slightly explains an idea the preceding image had already powerfully conveyed.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is largely excellent, with evocative, precise imagery and a controlled, rhythmic cadence. The opening is particularly strong. A minor weakness appears in the final two paragraphs, where the prose shifts from the concrete and sensory to the abstract and declarative ("rediscovering through parallel stories how love transcends..."). This brief summary dulls the final image, which was already doing the work more effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong, specific nouns ("kinetic parapet," "crystalline pillars"). However, it occasionally relies on abstract compound labels like "whisperfield calm" or "peripheral awareness" as shorthand, which can feel like telling rather than showing the quality described. While this contributes to the world's unique lexicon, a more grounded sensory description in key moments would have enhanced immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density, particularly in its descriptive passages. The rhythm is well-paced and the word choice is precise. A few instances of abstract summary ("something profound") and cliché ("crystalline clarity") are present, but they are minor flaws in an otherwise polished and evocative piece with no significant structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exquisite, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control on every line. Word choices are precise and evocative ("grief-tender," "time-drunk," "digital amber"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to build atmosphere, advance character, or heighten thematic resonance. The figurative language is fresh and seamlessly integrated, culminating in a final paragraph that is both clear and profoundly lyrical.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, evocative figurative language, and a clean, propulsive rhythm. There are no wasted words or overwrought descriptions; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or plot. Metaphors like "mechanical lungs" and "electromagnetic ghosts" are both fresh and perfectly integrated with the story's technological and ephemeral themes. The prose is polished to a level that meets the highest publication standards.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with high information density and strong imagery. There are, however, a few moments of slight overwriting that create minor friction. For instance, describing a clock hand as "accelerating past escape velocity" is a metaphor that strains its vehicle slightly. These are hairline issues in otherwise impeccable prose, but they prevent a perfect score by momentarily pulling focus from the otherwise seamless narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and often moving, with phrases like "hymning the mundane" and "pulsing stillness" demonstrating high craft. The rhythm is controlled, accelerating slightly during the creation of the album and settling into a resonant quiet at the end. The piece is commendably free of clutter. A minor deduction is for a few phrases that feel slightly too curated, such as labeling the tea "the scent of hope," which borders on telling rather than showing the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, but it is marked by a significant prose artifact: the exact phrase "quietly deliberate" is repeated three times to describe Lyra's actions. This repetition functions as a loop that lessens the impact and feels like a writerly tic. Additionally, the core epiphany ("Then she understood") is delivered as a summary rather than a dramatized process of deduction, slightly reducing the scene's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of immediate, publishable quality, demonstrating exceptional clarity, rhythm, and information density. Every line serves a purpose, weaving imagery and emotional progression together seamlessly. Phrases like "mercy and cruelty often shared the same garden path" and "his forgiveness had become a form of innovation" are both beautiful and functionally precise, showcasing a rare level of line-level mastery without a single wasted word or false note.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, marked by strong verbs and vivid, purposeful imagery ("mist curled... like liquid starlight," memories "resurfaced like breaching whales"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum, breathing in quiet moments and building toward the climax. The piece is commendably free of loops or scaffolding until the final paragraph, where the prose shifts slightly toward summary, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its descriptive passages. The rhythm and word choice are consistently strong. The piece is held back from the 9+ band by a few phrases that lean toward abstract summary ("grafted new meaning onto old wounds") rather than maintaining the powerful sensory embodiment found elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished, demonstrating high information density and a strong, varied rhythm that moves from concise declarations to flowing, lyrical descriptions. Word choice is precise and evocative ("violent patience," "sculptures of rust and rebellion"). The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting; its figurative language is integrated and powerful, contributing directly to atmosphere and theme without distracting.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("dawn painted gold," "golden thread") and verges on telling the reader the emotional impact ("the sorrow of disconnection"). These minor slips into less specific language slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft, preventing it from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high-density prose and consistently striking, original imagery ("threading memories through needle eyes," "mercury made of dawn"). Every sentence serves to advance the atmosphere or the careful, ritualistic action. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating a rare level of polish and control over its poetic register.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptional: precise, evocative, and rhythmically controlled from the first sentence to the last. Figurative language is both original and purposeful, as in "veins of quartz that spiraled through limestone walls like frozen lightning." The piece exhibits high information density with no line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting, achieving a rare clarity and elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and precise. Figurative language, such as the fractal resembling "whale ribs," is both beautiful and functional, advancing the story’s unique logic. The piece demonstrates high information density and sentence-level propulsion without a single wasted word or clichéd construction.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional: precise, evocative, and carrying a high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the story’s emotional cadence, from the practical precision of the carving to the flowing nature of memory. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating superior craft and a meticulous ear for language.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("archaeologist of voices"). However, a few minor blemishes slightly mar the otherwise flawless surface. A phrase like "made her head spin worse than the carousel ever had" feels a touch worn, and the explanatory sentence "She wasn't confused... she was experiencing..." is a moment of telling in a story that otherwise masters showing.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and clear for the most part, but the second half suffers from abstract language and paraphrase loops. Concepts like "complexity with purpose" or "the mechanics of human intention" are asserted rather than shown. Several adjacent sentences restate the same thematic point, which slows momentum and dulls the otherwise strong climax.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence advancing character or atmosphere. The rhythm is varied and confident, accelerating and decelerating in time with Elara's internal state. While the language is consistently elevated, it avoids overwriting, and the figurative language (light as music, script as composition) is coherent and purposeful. There are no notable loops, redundancies, or technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but there is some conceptual redundancy in the final paragraphs. Several sentences reiterate the same idea about legends leading back to the self, creating a slight drag on momentum right at the moment of closure. While the writing is polished, these paraphrase loops dilute the impact of what should be a sharp, final insight, constituting a prose artifact that dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, a few phrases, such as "a language older than written words" and "disappearing as quickly as the morning frost," rely on familiar constructions that slightly soften the otherwise sharp and specific language. While overwhelmingly strong, these minor moments of cliché prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is immaculate. The prose is dense with meaning and imagery, yet remains clear and propulsive. Figurative language, such as absence as "an erosion" or scars as "coordinates," is fresh and integral to the story's logic. There are no wasted sentences, loops, or scaffolding; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or theme, demonstrating a rare economy and elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often beautiful and propulsive, with strong sensory details and rhythmic control. The score is constrained by a few minor issues that detract from its polish. There is a clear paraphrase loop ("something new, something unprecedented. A flawed genesis, perhaps, but genesis nonetheless"), and a slight tendency toward ornamental figurative language that, while atmospheric, occasionally feels applied rather than essential.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative language. Sentences like "The obsidian lagoon breathed beneath the dunes" and "Each grain fell with the weight of memory" do immense work without a wasted word. There are no loops, scaffold, or overwriting; every metaphor is coherent and serves to deepen the story's accumulative power. The prose is clean, propulsive, and polished to a professional gleam.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, with a strong, varied rhythm. The information density is high, with sentences often performing multiple functions. A minor weakness is the sheer density of figurative language; nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, which, while individually strong, can feel slightly overwrought in aggregate and verge on a self-conscious style.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative from the first sentence to the last. Information density is high, with nearly every line serving character, theme, and atmosphere simultaneously. The rhythm of the sentences supports the story's meditative, serene tone, and there are no signs of overwriting, loops, or scaffolding. It demonstrates a rare level of polish and control.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb. Sentences are concise yet dense with sensory and emotional information (e.g., "its iron bones black against the salmon sky"). There are no wasted words, loops, or overwriting. The prose has a clean, resonant quality that propels the narrative forward while maintaining its meditative pace. The final paragraph, in particular, demonstrates exceptional rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The rhythm and syntax support the solemn tone effectively. There is a slight tendency towards overwriting in the final two paragraphs, where abstract concepts ("genuine accountability," "perpetual redemption") are named rather than shown, and the dream imagery feels less grounded than the rest of the story's tactile details.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and almost entirely free of artifacts. Word choice is precise and evocative, and the sentence-level rhythm propels the quiet narrative forward. A few key phrases of thematic insight ("the tender organization of love that survives flesh") feel slightly more abstract and polished than the surrounding sensory prose, a hairline register shift that is the only minor imperfection in an otherwise stellar piece.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and often beautiful, particularly in its opening and descriptive passages. It demonstrates high information density and strong rhythm. The score is tempered by a clear paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph ("This was how transformation sustained itself..." is immediately restated as "Her maps would...seeding new possibilities..."), which slightly dulls the momentum leading into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in most lines. However, the paragraph explaining precisely how the narrative spores will work ("Dreams would return first...") is a notable flaw. This section is an expository summary that momentarily stalls the forward momentum of the scene, telling the reader the outcome instead of allowing the tension of the unknown to persist into the final image. This strategic misstep in an otherwise polished piece prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—clean, evocative, and dense with meaning. Word choice is precise and the rhythm is controlled, accelerating with the arrival of the authorities and slowing for moments of artistic creation. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or the story's forward momentum with unwavering clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, establishing a potent atmosphere from the first sentence. Word choice is precise ("patient chronological defiance"), and the rhythm of the sentences effectively mirrors the story's tension and Marcus's internal state. There are no wasted words or distracting artifacts; every line serves to advance character, setting, or plot with high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, lyrical, and demonstrates high information density. The opening and closing lines are particularly strong, creating a frame of resonant imagery. The rhythm of the sentences effectively modulates the story's pace, from the quiet contemplation of the opening to the collaborative energy of the middle. While generally excellent, there is a minor recurrence of the phrase "braiding diverse voices into harmony," which feels slightly repetitive for a piece of this length.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often lyrical, with a strong rhythm that matches the contemplative action. The sentence-level craft is high, with very few redundancies or awkward constructions. The score is held back slightly by the tendency to summarize the theme in the final paragraph, a moment where showing through image alone would have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. Figurative language is generally strong ("like broken promises," "drops of liquid gold"), though a few moments verge on the overwrought, such as the confession feeling "like honey on her tongue." The primary weakness is the final, abstract sentence, which feels less crafted than the concrete imagery preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language ("cartographer of the imperceptible," "crystallized hush"). The prose is clean, with varied sentence structures that support the story's quiet, deliberate momentum. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; every sentence serves to deepen character, atmosphere, or understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and striking imagery ("dominoes falling upward through time"). There is a slight over-reliance on the "structural weakness" metaphor, which appears twice in a way that feels more like authorial scaffolding than organic thought. This minor repetition is the only notable friction in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece of writing, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, intelligent, and often beautiful, with high information density in most lines. Phrasing like "entropy disguised as wear" is masterful. A few moments, like the "safest choice was often the most dangerous illusion," verge on being slightly too declarative for an otherwise show-heavy piece, but this is a minor point in an exceptionally well-crafted narrative with no technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, specific imagery. However, a few phrases slightly dull the momentum with sentimentality or summarization. Lines like "Mira's insomnia became a gift" and "whose intentions transcended translation" explain feelings that the surrounding narrative already shows effectively. These are minor flaws in an otherwise polished piece, but they prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density and evocative imagery. The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-crafted. A minor flaw appears in the final paragraph, where phrases like "the fierce tenderness of the archivist who knows that every rescued detail is a small victory" risk becoming slightly abstract and label-like, momentarily pulling back from the concrete scene.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, with strong imagery like the tide's "dying breath." The sentence structure varies effectively, building momentum toward the climax. There are a few moments where abstract summary ("the weight of destiny") replaces more concrete embodiment, and the final paragraph leans toward explanation rather than pure image, slightly dulling the sharpness of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few phrases slightly weaken the overall effect. The simile "understanding flooding through her like formaldehyde" is jarring, and the construction "unbosom the secret that fear itself was keeping" is a touch abstract. These are minor slips in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery ("salt-kissed branches," "sussurus"). The rhythm and sentence structure support the building tension. A minor deduction is made for a few instances of register drift, where terms like "sonic engineering" and "fractal mathematics" feel slightly too technical and academic for the otherwise organic, mythic tone of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly efficient, with high information density in every line. The opening sentence is a masterclass in establishing tone and stakes, and the piece avoids any overwriting, scaffolding, or rhythmic monotony. Strong verbs and specific, sensory details ("salt-thick air," "deep, geological groan") create a palpable atmosphere without slowing momentum, resulting in a polished, propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, confident, and often evocative, with a strong opening and a well-paced rhythm. There are minor instances of overwriting or cliché ("glowing with purpose," "seeds of revelation") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. These are small blemishes on an overall polished piece with high information density and clear momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: lyrical, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is impeccable ("patient violence of water and time"), and figurative language is both beautiful and functional, enhancing atmosphere without a single misstep. There are no prose artifacts; every sentence is clean, concise, and carries significant weight, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density and evocative phrasing ("sang a different frequency," "reclaimed stillness"). Each sentence serves a clear purpose, advancing the narrative with a clean, propulsive rhythm. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought metaphors, resulting in a piece that is both beautiful and surgically precise at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, resonant imagery. The piece is slightly weakened by a few runs of template cadence, particularly the list-like sentences in the middle ("She captured... She preserved..."). This repetitive structure momentarily flattens the otherwise dynamic rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and propulsive. The language effectively balances scientific texture with emotional weight. A few phrases, such as the geode glowing "not with light but with possibility itself," lean towards abstraction where a more concrete image might have been stronger. The final paragraph risks overstating the theme, but its rhythmic cadence provides a powerful sense of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong imagery like "copper light bleeding across worn limestone walls." Momentum is steady, and sentences are well-constructed. The primary weakness is a tendency toward summary and abstraction in key emotional moments, such as the description of the chord as "simultaneously alien and deeply familiar," which tells the reader the intended effect rather than evoking it.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise language ("sieved hush," "bruised purples," "museum of tempered regret"). The prose propels the narrative forward without a single wasted word or clunky construction. There are no loops or overwritten passages; the writing is clean and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and largely flawless, with high information density and strong momentum. Lines like "emerged from the mist like a confession finally spoken" demonstrate superb craft. A minor point of friction is the slightly too-perfect rhetorical structure of "Both were wrong. Both were young. Both deserve...," which feels more like a prepared statement than spontaneous thought, briefly breaking the naturalistic feel.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. Most sentences advance the story with precision. A few phrases, such as "backlash of regrets" or "flickering faith," lean on familiar constructions, preventing the line-level craft from being flawless, but overall the execution is very strong and free of significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptional: clean, evocative, and dense with information. Figurative language, such as "delicately robust like pressed flowers that refuse to crumble," is both original and precise. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to momentum and atmosphere, culminating in a powerful and polished piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and largely pristine, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There are minor instances where abstraction slightly softens the impact, such as "permeating reality itself." Similarly, the sentence detailing Kess's death is a dense block of exposition in a story that otherwise excels at showing. These are hairline faults in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, with striking, original metaphors. Every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the internal state. There is a slight risk of overwriting due to the high density of figurative language, and the repetition of "onyx" borders on a stylistic tic, but these are minor points in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece with no loops or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is frequently beautiful and evocative, with strong, specific imagery like tears shimmering with "an opalescent sheen" or a fracture "like oil on water." However, the momentum is slightly dulled by moments of abstraction and summary, particularly in the final paragraph ("complexity," "capacity," "understanding," "luminous acceptance"). Grounding this final state in a more concrete sensory detail would have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and imagistic, with strong rhythms and precise word choices. However, a few lines slip into a less effective register, such as the slightly clinical "rewriting her cellular structure" or the textbook-like description of matter changing states. These moments introduce a jarring note of abstraction into an otherwise seamless and sensory-rich narrative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong imagery like "captured fire" and "winking hush." However, the momentum is slightly dulled at the very end by a few sentences that summarize what has just been shown. The line "But its true purpose—as the key that unlocked a thousand small rebellions—would ripple outward" is a paraphrase loop, restating the core idea after the action is already complete.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, with evocative figurative language and a controlled rhythm that propels the narrative. Sentences like "The aurora writhed above Keeper Yann like living serpents of green light" are superb. The piece is held back from the highest tier by a few instances of conceptual scaffolding, where an internal state is summarized ("But knowing what would happen had never meant controlling it") rather than fully embodied in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with high information density in nearly every line ("constellation of fear," "atlas of absences," "grammar of storms"). The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative yet urgent mood. A slight deduction is warranted for one image—"applause from the universe itself"—which dips into cliché and stands out against the profound originality of the surrounding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and precise. Sentence structure is varied, creating a rhythm that is both intellectual and compelling. Word choice is excellent, with phrases like "dignified chaos" and "intellectual jazz" landing with force and clarity. There is no wasted language; every line contributes to character, atmosphere, or the advancement of the central conceit without a single loop or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative and concise prose that carries high information density. Sentences like "The roof had been cut away by scavengers hunting copper, leaving the space open to stars" are both efficient and atmospheric. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency toward abstract summary ("a small revolution against the permanence everyone else seemed to crave") where a concrete image might have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and information-dense from the opening line. Figurative language is consistently inventive and precise, such as compasses pointing to "memories instead of north." There are no wasted words, scaffold, or repetitive phrasing; every sentence serves to build atmosphere, advance the plot, or deepen the character's emotional state. The line-level craft is exceptional, creating momentum and clarity even within its complex, fantastical framework.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional: precise, poetic, and dense with meaning without feeling overwritten. Lines like "no larger than a pearl but heavier than grief" and "laughter recorded on seismographs" demonstrate high-level craft. The rhythm is controlled, varying with the scene's needs, and the story is free of loops or scaffolding, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—lyrical, concise, and demonstrating exceptional information density. Figurative language, such as the compass needle pointing to "the exact shade of cerulean that pools in the hollow of a throat when someone struggles not to cry," is both original and emotionally devastating. The line-level craft is flawless, with no wasted words, loops, or overwriting, propelling the quiet narrative with immense grace.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and advancing atmosphere through metaphors like "marble the air" without muddle, though some figurative stacking in the hush descriptions borders on overwriting in peak beats. No loops or scaffolds; sentences propel via strong verbs and specificity, with clean grammar and purposeful syntax. Opening anchors voice effectively, and final line recharges motifs with propulsion. Minor register drift in elevated diction like "resin preserving a moment" feels slightly jarring for the oracle's implied simplicity, but doesn't obscure closure.
