== Grader: Claude Opus 4.1 (no reasoning) ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but occasional overwriting in figurative language ("Poetry, after all, was just physics with fewer equations and more awe") and some filter-verb clustering in observation passages. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the greenhouse description sections.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("spirals mimicking galaxy arms, branching veins echoing capillaries"). Some repetitive structures in the middle section ("She [verb]. She [verb].") and occasional abstraction ("drifting resonance") that could be more concrete. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("winterglass," "frozen mid-cascade"). However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "She didn't need ears anymore. Her skin heard. Her bones conducted." repeats the same concept. Some template cadence in the emotional thermal descriptions. The text-artifact of generation word counts creates minor distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and high information density, particularly in the prism-placement sequence. However, some passages contain near-duplicate concepts ("rest a permanent address" appears twice verbatim) and occasional abstract phrasing ("architechture of his design"). The filter-verb cluster in the soul-appearance section ("didn't speak," "didn't need to") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some abstract phrasing ("quiet currency of care," "intergenerational support") dulls immediacy. Information density high in action sequences. Minor template cadence in middle section listing what others began doing. No major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Petals drifted from ironwork arches like ash from a gentle fire" simultaneously establishes setting, atmosphere, and mortality subtext. Zero loops or scaffold. Some elevated diction ("spectral processions," "permeate") fits the spiritual quest context without breaking POV coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("leaves that pulsed like veins," "sky bruised violet"). Some density issues with stacked metaphors in the middle section and occasional abstract phrasing ("temporal pressure zones"). The final paragraph's clarity about time's texture elevates the score despite earlier figurative congestion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments like "Each step cracked the earth. Each breath carried spores" show excellent compression. However, several instances of elevated diction ("the staggering grace of someone who knew," "dignity of a falling monarch") create register drift. Some paraphrase loops appear ("She wasn't just opening a door. She was planting resilience") that reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density with most lines doing multiple jobs, strong rhythmic variation, and vivid specific language ("skeletal ribs of shipwrecks"). Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from the established register ("alchemy of grief," "harmonic dissonance"). No significant loops or scaffolding, though a few abstract phrases could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("cathedral of crossings," multiple metaphors for the station). Some repetitive structures in the flower code explanations create mild template cadence. Information density is high and momentum sustained, but the prose occasionally reaches for elevated diction that slightly strains the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("rainbow shards now danced on metal") but suffers from repetitive sentence structures and abstract phrasing ("thoughtfully spirited" appears twice, "quietly, melting" forces alliteration). Template cadence in the middle spheres section (-0.6). Information density varies; strongest in concrete craft moments, weakest in abstract reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("iron rafters bowed like tired spines") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. Template cadence appears in "I used to be... I'm just... I'm here to" construction. Some paraphrase loops ("firmly adaptive—not by choice, but by survival" followed immediately by explanation) and register drift into elevated diction ("baptized in trembling certainty") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, but figurative language occasionally obscures ("ambered hush" appears frequently without clear physical correlate). Some paraphrase loops around silence-mapping concept. Prose rhythm varies effectively with storm/stillness contrast, though elevated diction sometimes strains POV credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong opening and closing lines with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. However, several passages suffer from abstract philosophical phrasing ("the slow accretion of meaning through looped timelines") and occasional register drift that dulls immediacy. The prose is clean but sometimes prioritizes lyricism over clarity in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the lens caught the beam and threw it downward—not as an image, but as a trembling circle of silver"). Some elevated diction strains POV credibility ("metronomic rhythm," "resonant hush"), and repetitive "No one spoke/No one needed to" structure briefly stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves strong imagery ("knuckles gnarled as old rootstock," "heavy as regret, sweet as forgiveness") with good density. Some repetitive structures appear ("She polished," "She believed," "She smiled") and occasional abstraction ("reciprocity blooms in the unseen"). The accumulative design justifies some repetition but a few passages could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic variation and purposeful paragraph structure, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("bruised violet and silver," "ice and velvet") and repetitive constructions ("She'd spent...She called it"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple elements, though some figurative language feels forced ("accordion-style" time folding). Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagistic prose with high information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, action, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the performance sequence. Minor repetition of water/flood imagery and occasional overwriting ("motes of glitter and rust in spiraling arpeggios") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("aurora bled violet across the snowfields") and purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting appears in metaphor density ("silence was a glacier—slow, crushing, inevitable") and occasional abstract phrasing ("the weight of swallowed truths") that could be more concrete, but line-level control remains solid.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("machinery groaning back to life without power, looms clattering like chattering teeth"). Some register drift ("calibration," "regurgitated") and repetitive "She'd" openings in early paragraphs (-0.4). The final paragraph contains mild abstraction that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with evocative imagery, but density issues emerge: "regenerative silence" appears verbatim three times, metaphor clustering in paragraphs 5-7 slows momentum. The line "knowing that to witness without judgment was the rarest form of love" risks thesis-statement directness. Strong information density in the vision sequence partially compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the sun bled into a silver ring and the world hushed into a velvet pause") with strong rhythmic control through varied sentence lengths. Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple functions. However, some abstract phrasing ("ordinary magic," "lifelong wonder") appears without sufficient grounding, and occasional overwrought metaphors ("fingers that moved like slow tides") edge toward purple prose without quite crossing into muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("shadow between bookshelves," "spines split open like ribs after autopsy"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing discovery or atmosphere. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("tilted doorframes that no carpenter could fix") and some repetitive structures in the discovery sequence that create mild template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in fortune sequences. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in places ("fog thicker than regret," "emotional coastlines") without becoming overwrought. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction and one instance of template phrasing in the fortune-effect sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("cassock stitched from frayed audio tape") and purposeful rhythm. However, some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("paradoxes that bloom like wounds") and occasional abstract phrasing ("hollows beneath this unraveled stillness") could be more concrete. The final paragraph contains slight redundancy with "careful, cruel, clarifying" that could be tightened. Information density is high but occasionally tips toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in memory sequences that build both scene and symphony. Rhythm varies effectively between longer descriptive passages and short declarative beats. Some abstract phrasing ("chronologically homesick," "what might still sing") and occasional register drift into elevated diction reduce clarity, though the prose maintains momentum toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, though some metaphysical abstractions slow momentum ("the between the drop and the ripple, that sliver of time"). Syntactic variety supports scene rhythm, particularly in the confession sequence's parallel structure. Template phrases appear ("not with... but with" repeated) and some overwrought metaphors ("cause hadn't yet kissed effect") reduce clarity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("cedar staves curved like ribs," "melodies inverted into question marks") but suffers from repetitive "She [verb]" constructions in the phonograph sequence. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("scalpel," "key," "catalyst" for the needle) creates mild overwriting. Information density generally high with purposeful rhythm variation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variations, though some passages tend toward overwriting ("shadows deepening around him, the first stars pricking through the violet dusk"). Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing character, plot, or atmosphere. Minor template cadence appears in the resolution section.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the UV revelation sequence. Several instances of abstract phrasing ("nostalgia's currency," "guardian, curator, silent lantern-lighter") and some repetitive structures in the closing paragraphs. The transformation sequence maintains momentum despite occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("auroras humming hymns older than language"). Some repetitive structures ("She didn't... She offered...") and occasional overwriting ("mercy. Behind her, the village began weaving"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though a few philosophical passages edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The note trembles outward, brushing the panes, nudging the rusted ribs of shipwrecks"). Some repetitive structures appear ("She plays..." sequences) but serve accumulative design; occasional overwriting in metaphorical density ("chronic hush," "glass-lit gloom") creates mild opacity without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.7)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and character state). Some figurative density in peak beats ("silver storm beneath her ribs") serves the accumulative mode. Minor deductions for two instances of slight redundancy ("fingertips still tingling with residual static" after establishing the static thoroughly) and one template-adjacent construction.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "cycle/circular" motifs. Deductions for template cadence in the middle section ("The night sweeper...The rope braider...The galley dish washer") and some abstract phrasing ("cautious exuberance—the kind that fears..."). Information density is mostly strong.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She was becoming myth, and myth was the first stitch in community's quilt"). Some repetitive structures appear ("She had come not for...," "She had heard rumors...") and occasional overwriting ("luminescent ache of one who remembers belonging"), but momentum generally sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the canals carry both physical navigation and acoustic properties). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("embryos in amniotic silence," "midwife memory") approaches oversaturation but maintains clarity at closure; occasional template cadence ("She moved...She climbed...She pressed") creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density high in discovery sequences. However, template cadence appears in emotional beats ("She didn't eat it. She cradled it"), paraphrase loops in the buried optimism explanation, and some purple prose ("stalactite chandeliers"). Minor scaffold in repeated "She [verb]" constructions through middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in sensory passages. Rhythm varies naturally between longer descriptive sentences and short emotional punches like "She didn't hoard them out of greed, but out of reverence." Some repetitive structure in "She didn't... She'd..." patterns and occasional abstract phrasing ("slow erosion of soul") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple layers, though some paraphrase loops appear ("stopped trying to fix"/"stopped dissecting"). Rhythm varies naturally between technical observation and lyrical transformation. Minor template cadence in the "She stopped" sequence, though it creates intentional accumulative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong images ("librarian of loss," "bruised clouds"). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("haggard awe"), some filter constructions ("she'd seen it"), and minor template patterns in the middle section listing discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density high in descriptive passages. Some abstract phrasing around "unseen forces" and "overlapping shadows" borders on repetitive without advancing specificity. The "residue of forgotten spells" explanation feels slightly expository.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.8)
    While prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("absences—those hollows where voices, ships, and histories had once thrived"), repetitive constructions emerge: multiple "She [verb]" openings, conceptual loops around absence/loss/memory. The phrase "staggered intervals" appears twice identically. Information density is uneven, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely restate.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("mirrors that reflected not her face, but her doubts") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats with mixed metaphors and elevated diction. Template cadence appears in places ("She'd mapped...She believed...She knelt"). Information density is high but clarity occasionally suffers from abstract constructions and conceptual language that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm shifts, though some passages edge toward overwriting—"the quiet courage of standing small beneath an infinite sky" and similar constructions. Information density high in peak moments. Deduction for occasional abstract philosophizing and some repetitive structures ("not X, but Y" pattern overused).

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression, but several overwrought metaphors strain clarity ("whips of ionized regret," "dais of solidified aurora"). Template cadence appears briefly ("He heard...A soldier's...A poet's..."). Information density high and most lines do multiple jobs, though some ornamental flourishes don't advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("As the ink flowed, the paper trembled") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "mathematics of fair trade" and occasional template cadence ("It was practice. It was presence. It was..."). Information density is high in action beats but dilutes in the philosophical final section. The closing image sequence maintains momentum despite abstraction creep.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—"her boots brushing dew from moss-carved stones" establishes setting, movement, and texture simultaneously. Some metaphorical density in places ("incandescent restraint") but serves the accumulative design. The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax that accelerates during discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information-dense prose with strong rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph lengths creating visual texture. Excellent specificity in "Container 7-Alpha" and sensory details. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("texture—the grit beneath memory's skin") and some synonym repetition around "fragments/whispers/murmurs" that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the cello balanced between her knees, the painted seashell resting on its bridge like an offering to the void"). Figurative language serves purpose without overwhelming ("sound like cracked bells tumbling down stone stairs"). Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("the riddle breathing") but overall strong propulsion and zero loops.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and purposeful rhythm variations. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in the middle section and some synonym churn around "reorganize/redirect/salvage" that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially technical descriptions that build both world and emotion. Some figurative density in peak moments ("marrow," "sky too bright to weep") but serves accumulative pressure. Minor repetition of "meant to" in closing weakens momentum slightly but doesn't touch closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong rhythm and imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting ("salt-tinged sky, carrying pollen and promise") and some template structures ("She didn't need...she felt"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor loops in the emotional register descriptions detract from otherwise strong line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"rivers begin where language listens" compresses theme and plot elegantly. Some figurative density in places ("star-stung dark," "bookmark in the fabric of reality") approaches overwriting but remains controlled enough to maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, but some figurative density in peak beats ("roots seeking water," "dust motes in slanting sun") without full payoff. Minor template cadence in the "She..." openings mid-story. The prose achieves propulsion through accumulation rather than variation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the descent sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, stakes, and interiority simultaneously. Minor deductions for abstract phrasing ("unsnarl the knotted timelines") and slight repetition of "gathered hush" without evolution, plus some filter-verb clustering ("She saw...She felt").

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong imagery ("breath shallow, palms slick against rust") with varied sentence structures. Information density is high—most lines advance multiple purposes. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("folding space like origami") and abstract phrasing ("sustained, gentle, hovering in the air like breath before a kiss") that dulls momentum in the final movement.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions that advance both atmosphere and stakes. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("ghost bride drifted"/"She ghosted through") and template cadence in the middle section's "She had been"/"He thought"/"Her vengeance" construction. The prose maintains momentum despite these artifacts, with the final fruit sequence achieving excellent sensory specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with most lines doing multiple jobs, and the prose rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. However, figurative language appears too frequently in peak beats without clear payoff ("drowned constellations," "heart wrapped in velvet" cluster densely). Some template cadence in the "She [verb]" repetitions mid-story, though this partially reads as intentional patterning.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information-dense prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("where roots still snake between bones, the diaspora returnee became the orchard's quiet compass") and occasional abstract phrasing ("purposeful wandering," "cautious enchantment") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, and the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("chalk faded, rain came, children grew"). However, paraphrase loops appear throughout (the repeated explanations of her method) and some metaphors strain credibility ("cathedral of lost connections and slow deliveries"). Template cadence emerges in lists like "not faster, but deeper / not louder, but kinder."

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of elevated diction and near-repetitive phrasing ("silent as a shadow slipping between shelves"). Some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though occasional overwriting ("frozen tear," "fingernails on slate") doesn't always serve pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("She didn't speak the apology aloud") but suffers from occasional overwriting and compound modifiers ("moss-slick roots," "salt-thick air"). Information density varies; the middle section with the leaf-messages could compress further. No major loops or scaffolding, but some figurative density in peak beats reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic variation and purposeful repetition ("Let it breathe. Let it be witnessed.") creates momentum. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bruised twilight into liquid gold") and one register drift ("symbiosis" feels academic for this POV).

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several template constructions weaken momentum: "She visited...she sat with" parallel structure, abstract phrases like "emotional gravity" and "resonance." The prose occasionally reaches for elevated diction that creates distance rather than immediacy, particularly in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The nickel's grooves, worn by thumb and time, caught stray sunlight and threw it sideways—not as light, but as sound"), though occasional abstract phrasing ("the self beyond self") could ground more concretely. Sentence variety and rhythm support the accumulative structure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several passages suffer from abstract telling ("standing guard over her spark of defiance") and some overwriting in metaphorical density. Template cadence appears in the ending's parallel structures ("Through the children... Through the librarians... Through the rogue scholar"). Prose maintains momentum despite these frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("Fishermen claimed to hear her in their nets at twilight") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Some mixed metaphors ("time spiraled" then "pooled") and occasional register elevation ("transmute," "photosynthesize") create friction. Information density remains high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines serving multiple functions: "She carried no lantern, no torch; she lit her path by listening" advances plot while establishing character method. Some elevated diction ("gently systematic grace," "pearlescent floor") occasionally drifts toward purple but mostly serves the lyrical mode. Information density is strong, though a few abstractions ("museum of extinct feelings") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments of rhythmic control during the performance sequence. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for template cadence in places ("She began. The first phrase...The glass ink well..."), some synonym loops around "truth/trust," and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"each link calibrated not just for distance but for memory" layers technical and emotional registers. Rhythm varies naturally between long accumulative sentences and short declarations. Minor repetition of "slyly heartfelt" and some elevated diction ("dormant volcano's warmth seep into her bones") occasionally slows momentum but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("dust motes swirled like forgotten alphabets," "leaning like tired sentinels") though occasionally risks density in peak beats. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She taught...She placed...She balanced"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. The "withering beauty" oxymoron in line 24 effectively captures the story's tonal complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("silence here wasn't absence, but compression"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm shifts. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("featherly determined") and some filter-heavy passages ("She intuited," "she understood") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("kelp and coral framing the abyssal sky" = setting + atmosphere + worldview). Some figurative density in places ("shadowseam wonder" appears twice), but rhythmic control during the firefly encounter accelerates appropriately. Minor template moments ("She smiled," "She whispered") but propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"salt-crusted skin" establishes character history while describing appearance. Some figurative density in peak moments ("like vines climbing forgotten walls") but pattern-taught and coherent. Minor repetition of "missing pieces" and "vanished" but serves accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in performance sequences. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("orchestrated serendipity"/"orchestrating serendipity," repeated "lightly attentive"). Some sentences reach for elevated diction that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies ("fragile, fertile pause"). The final third maintains better momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Each step was choreography, each sway a stanza"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("cosmic verse on mortal skin") but pattern-taught and paid off. Minor template cadence in "She danced past/until" sequences. Clear propulsion maintained though occasional elevated diction ("obsidian grace") could simplify.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Pearl Bay at dawn was never silent, but this morning it whispered"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("noctilucent reckonings") but remains voice-consistent. Minor template cadence appears mid-piece ("He remembered...He smiled...He rose") but doesn't touch closure. Rhythm varies purposefully between long meditative sentences and short anchoring beats.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density varies with some powerful lines ("each step a quiet negotiation with gravity and memory") but significant repetition issues. Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("He had come not to fight... but to bargain"). Multiple paraphrase loops around the same concepts (pain/burden/translation) reduce momentum. The "gently skilled" phrase repeats verbatim three times.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("tide-polished," "trial balloons—tiny, glowing orbs of speculative intent") but suffers from periodic overwriting. Mixed metaphors appear ("hope had different densities" vs. "scaffold of variables"). Template cadence emerges in the pattern-launch-observe sequences ("She began again," "She watched," "She placed"). The piece maintains momentum but occasionally loops conceptually, restating the mathematical-hope connection.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ivy here was older than the passage itself"). Minor figurative excess appears ("curled like a sleeping serpent," "curled like unborn birds" creates repetition) and some abstract phrasing ("legacy's burden") lacks concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the mirror transformation sequence. Some overwriting appears ("fever-bright eyes," "silent pact with gravity") but doesn't obscure closure. Template cadence emerges in the "She did not..." constructions near the end. Clear propulsion through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally strong prose with effective rhythm variation and imagery, but several overwritten passages strain clarity: "hesitant fireflies drawn to a gravity they could not name" and similar constructions. Information density is high - most sentences advance both action and atmosphere. The final sentence attempts too much, creating slight congestion at the crucial closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("boots sinking slightly into the mineral crust"). However, several abstract phrases reduce immediacy ("fractured grace," "manufactured drought" without concrete detail), and occasional repetitive structures ("He didn't...He didn't...He..."). The filter verb "felt" appears at a crucial moment. Information density is high but could be more consistently concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but abstract phrasing occasionally dulls immediacy ("alarming serenity was her mantle now"). Some metaphor density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff ("threads were not merely obstacles; they were guardians"). Opening and closing lines strongly anchor voice and recharge motifs. Template cadence appears briefly ("She had come here... She had never taken... She defied them...") but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("moral evasion," "ethical weight") and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages. The "meteor hush" repetition works as pattern but borders on precious.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("embers caught in slow wind," "knot memory into the living world"). However, abstract passages create momentum drag ("truth lived in the ephemeral, in what vanished before it could be claimed") and some template repetition in "She [verb]" constructions. The phrase "transiently rooted" appears three times with diminishing returns.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density high with most sentences carrying multiple functions (action + atmosphere + meaning). Some repetitive structures appear ("I [verb]" patterns in middle section) and occasional abstract phrasing ("technically gentle" used twice without variation). Strong propulsion in the casting sequence and powerful closing image sequence from "I pack my tools" onward.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most lines doing double work, but several abstract passages reduce momentum ("paths choose their walkers when the walker's essence resonates with the path's hidden architecture"). Template cadence appears in the "She [verb]" pattern across multiple paragraphs. The closing sequence regains propulsion with concrete action and strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and effective rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, several instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "dusky harmony" appears twice, some metaphors strain ("time slowed like syrup under moonlight"), and there's occasional template cadence in the middle section ("He had sold...eaten...traded"). The filter-verb stack in paragraph 11 ("thought," "knowing") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("scheming pacifist" immediately establishes contradiction). Some repetitive phrasing around "release/released/releasing" creates minor loops. Excellent syntactic variety and paragraph rhythm, particularly the staccato "Now, silence. Not peace. Not rest." sequence that accelerates tension.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "silver-scaled thing with eyes like molten mercury." Some figurative density in places ("glass mountains...that was the tone she carried in her marrow") and minor template cadence in the "She did not chant. She did not plead" sequence, though it serves rhythmic purpose. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("ladder woven from ivy and old hymnals"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("captured sky," "shy confession") and occasional template phrasing ("She sighed, then grinned"). Information density high—most lines advance multiple story functions. Final image of climbing with "honey, thread, and hope" resonates without forcing.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("fruit that pulsed like embryonic stars") while maintaining forward momentum through varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple purposes. However, some metaphorical density in peak moments ("second skeleton," "field to be harvested") slightly obscures clarity, and occasional abstraction ("resonance across possibilities") could ground more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("gravity seemed to stutter," "footnotes dangled like ripe fruit") but occasional overwriting ("humming in the air like a tuning fork struck wrong"). Some abstract passages lack concrete anchoring, and metaphor density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in exposition-heavy middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the garden sequence. Minor figurative excess in places ("groaned like a dying beast") and occasional abstraction ("trapped freedom defined the air"). The prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful fragments, though some descriptive passages could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Generally strong prose with good information density - most sentences advance multiple purposes. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She picked it up... She placed the seal... She studied the rope's braids"). Minor figurative muddle with "dormant syntax" metaphor that doesn't fully cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"frozen weeping that had formed over millennia" conveys time, process, and emotional register simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("storms incarnate, dancing in spirals of raw voltage") but serves the accumulative texture. The "hammered repose" image effectively charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in peak moments ("The pavilion's hum deepened, became a chorus"). Minor repetitive structures ("She had," "She knew") create slight template cadence but don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("solid fog cracked faintly underfoot, chiming like frozen bells"). Some overwriting in extended metaphorical sequences ("shadow lengths...like slow hands of a clock counting griefs") and occasional abstract phrasing ("deepening hush"). Information density is high but momentum occasionally slows during descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density appears in images like "petals that release phosphorescent dust, each step igniting momentary halos" doing multiple jobs, but several passages contain paraphrase loops ("filters everything...through ambient awareness, letting the fortress speak"). The prose maintains momentum through the closure sequence despite occasional abstract phrasing ("hopelessness gained gravity") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and character state). Rhythm varies purposefully between long contemplative sentences and short declarations. Minor repetition of "pause/transition" concepts and some abstract phrasing ("quality of attention") slightly dulls momentum without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("clouds curled like sleeping lions") with good syntactic variety and information density. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("intangibly tangible" appears twice, "xenial") but serves the lyrical mode. Minor redundancy in silence descriptions but overall maintains momentum through varied paragraph lengths and clear sensory progression.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs—"The gondola dipped slightly as she settled onto the velvet bench, and the terrace tiles responded with a low harmonic hum." Some abstract phrasing ("catalyzing stillness," "fluidly logical patterns") and occasional register elevation reduce immediacy without harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("solidified memory, each step a frozen moment: a mother's lullaby"). Information density is high and momentum sustained. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("chromatic syntax only the ruby flake could fully decipher"), some filter verb clustering ("She paused," "She did so," "She moved"), and slight template cadence in the middle action sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She burns bridges carefully—not with fire, but with measured silence"). Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("mourner and midwife," "anointing her") creates slight opacity. Template cadence appears briefly ("She did not..." repetitions) but serves rhythmic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structures, particularly effective in the convergence sequence. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for overwriting in places ("shadowseam wonder," "viscous potential smelling of ozone and old libraries") and some abstract phrasing ("existential pressure") that could be more concrete. The "virtuously mischievous" repetition feels somewhat forced.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several passages suffer from ornamental overwriting: "the unseen architecture of consequence," "living lattice of memory and resonance." The standing waves section contains unnecessary abstraction that slows momentum. Template phrasing appears in "She remembered...She stepped...She rose" sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm control, particularly in the transformation sequences. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered template phrases ("not to X, but to Y" appears 5+ times), some abstract/elevated diction in peak beats ("liminal space," "syntax of becoming"), and minor paraphrase loops around the unsnapping concept.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("a smudge shaped like a child's palm pressed near the edge") but suffers from repetitive constructions and occasional overwriting. Template patterns appear ("She'd spent years believing," "She didn't heal by," "She smiled, not because") and some metaphors strain ("memorials back into living stories"). The final sections contain paraphrase loops about healing through magnification that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in action sequences. Information density remains high—most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously. However, several instances of elevated diction ("auric," "latent memory," "siphoned power") create mild register drift, and occasional overwriting ("liquid mirrors that warped and revealed") slightly impedes momentum without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density generally high with purposeful figurative language, though several passages contain near-paraphrase loops ("playing absence into presence" / "not a denial, but an erasure—a gentle subtraction"). Some elevated diction ("embouchure," "auguries") fits the mystical tone but occasionally creates distance. Strong opening and closing lines anchor the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("leaves spiraling downward not with decay, but coded rhythm") but suffers from density overload and occasional register drift. Template cadence appears in monument-building sequences ("She embedded...She documented...She realized"). Mixed metaphors blur clarity ("the arbor exhaled its secrets" vs "spoke in arboreal glyphs"), and abstract phrases like "where past meets prophecy" provide atmosphere without concrete anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid moments ("phosphorescent moss," "vines swallowed iron frames like green teeth"). Information density is high in opening and closing sections. Deductions for repetitive structures in the middle section, some filter-verb clustering ("He found," "He began," "He slept"), and occasional overwriting ("starlight-mimicking dew"). The "uncertainly certain" construction appears twice without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong images like "fireflies born of starlight and sorrow." Deductions for repetitive sentence structures ("She [verb]" pattern), some abstract scaffolding around "balance," and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density. The final image of the golden seam lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the tooth "catching dawn-light like a secret" establishes both time and mystery). Some figurative density in emotional beats ("luminous ache—that tender bruise of joy and loss pressed together until they bled the same color") approaches overwriting. Minor repetition of "misaligned harp" and template structure in ghost descriptions ("men who'd drowned in wine, women who'd buried their songs").

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative coherence with the mathematical/geometric imagery threading throughout. Some elevated diction ("manifold," "asymptote") fits the concept but occasionally strains. Template repetition in "I braced" and slight overuse of abstract philosophizing about mercy lower the score.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("shimmering elusively tangible, like heat haze") without clear payoff. Generally clean grammar and varied syntax, though occasional abstract phrasing ("between-worlds," "unfasten the knot") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("ambient moonlight reflect off its curve") but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Several instances of overwriting ("lint, ash, the ghost of glitter") and register drift into elevated diction clash with the technician's working-class position. Template cadence appears in places ("He didn't move... Then he heard it... He turned slowly"), though information density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong imagery density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The whisper was not idle noise—it was a destabilizer of perfect systems"). Some conceptual repetition around equilibrium/chaos could be compressed. Prose rhythm varies effectively between short declarations and flowing descriptions. Minor scaffold in explaining the whisper's function rather than letting action demonstrate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("crystal vase shard like a rosary of regrets") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching. Some register drift into academic diction ("spectral scans," "harmonic frequencies") and occasional template cadence in the discovery sequence reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong moments of lyrical precision ("shadows grew teeth and stolen light pooled under doors like spilled mercury") but several instances of abstract philosophizing dilute momentum ("mending what isn't torn: the invisible fractures in melody"). Template patterns appear in parallel constructions ("not with tools, but with truth, not with force, but with resonance"). The prose achieves beauty but occasionally at the expense of forward drive.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"rope biting into her palms, breath shallow, heart steady" conveys action, sensation, and emotional state simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs. Deduction for occasional overwrought metaphors ("factory's last whistle echoing like a dying breath") and some template phrasing in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong rhythmic control in storm passages ("Rain needled her scalp, wind tugged at her sleeves") with effective variation. Information density is high, particularly in the magic slide's transformations. Deductions for occasional abstraction loops ("gesture repeated, trust layered like sediment" followed by similar restatements) and some template phrasing in the community response section that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information-dense prose with strong imagery, but repetitive structural patterns emerge ("She still carries...She still kneels...She still reckons"). Some purple prose in peak moments ("umbral tenderness of night") and the extended ending creates mild momentum drag despite lyric intention.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=5.8)
    Strong imagery ("obsidian lagoon," "corroded copper") but severe template cadence issues: "She had spent...She had tried...She knew then she was..." runs throughout. Abstract philosophical assertions ("Truth, she learned, thrives in tension") replace concrete scene work in multiple beats. The piece tells about scholars arriving and visitors seeking reckoning rather than dramatizing these pivotal moments, creating momentum drag that obscures the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally high with purposeful imagery, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("revival had begun...revival was not his alone"). Template cadence appears in the "He [verb]" pattern across multiple paragraphs. The prose achieves moments of excellence ("silence pooled in alleyways") but inconsistent compression prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (the plum trees both mark time and store emotion). Some paraphrase loops around the emotional archive concept and repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Strong opening and closing lines. Deduction for filter-verb stacks and some abstract phrasing around "emotional ecosystems."

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("ice began to weep. Not melt—weep"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("not calm, not frantic"). Deduction for occasional overwriting in figurative density ("hollows behind the eyes," "marrow") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("texture of borrowed time").

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Her boots, laced with care but worn thin at the soles, whispered against the risers as if apologizing" establishes character, setting, and tone simultaneously. Some figurative density in places ("needle stitching heaven to earth") but generally supports the contemplative tone. Clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("sky wept embers," "ink in water") with strong information density. However, abstract phrases like "flourishing stillness," "primal elegance," and "rhythm of deep space breathing" create occasional opacity. Some filter-verb clustering ("He stood," "He knelt," "He rose") in the witnessing sequence dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose shows high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She bore no name now; names were for the living who still traded words"). Some elevated diction ("mute eloquence") fits the mythic register. Minor repetition of "silence/silent" but serves accumulative pattern. Strong propulsion through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "cracked open the earth like an old book," but occasional overwriting ("grit of joy, the silk of sorrow, the chalk of regret") and template listing in the translucent figures sequence. Information density is high but some metaphor strings edge toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing character and theme). Some figurative density in opening that borders on overwriting ("bruised sky," "spilled ink," "salt-cured silence"). Clean syntax variety and purposeful paragraph lengths. Deduction for elevated register phrases that occasionally drift from POV.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with lines like "architecture not built, but coaxed" doing multiple jobs, but template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("Children brought him acorns; elders brought tea"). Several paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "respect isn't earned by dominance" followed immediately by proving "you belong in the design" restates without advancing. The prose achieves moments of excellence ("a sigh lost in the rustle of leaves") but accumulates enough minor redundancies to limit the score.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, though occasional overwriting appears ("bronze quiet sentinel," multiple compound descriptors). Some repetitive phrasing around "convergence" and "footprints" creates minor loops. The closing sequence achieves strong propulsion despite these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in "He wore no livery, only a coat stitched with pockets—each holding a dried seed pod." Some elevated diction risks register drift ("narrow vastness," "gloom-hill") but serves the mythic tone. Minor redundancy in explaining submerged concord both directly and through demonstration. The line "trailing dusk like a shawl" exemplifies the piece's careful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some repetitive structures ("He + verb" patterns) and abstract phrasing ("translate distance into closeness") create minor drag. The "intuively descriptive" phrase appears forced. Otherwise strong sensory specificity and varied paragraph rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Deducted for repetitive "stretched" imagery, some abstract constructions ("confusion had become her compass"), and occasional overwriting in metaphors ("frozen fire"). The "echoed silence" repetition feels purposeful but becomes slightly heavy.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and strong imagery. Information density is high, with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("bruised purple at noon," multiple compound descriptors) and some repetitive phrasing around "sacred/chivalrous" concepts that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("heel-to-toe arcs," "the baker who still weighed flour with closed eyes") but some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless") without full payoff. Minor repetition of "benevolently ruthless" and slight register elevation in peak moments, though the walking-pattern device propels effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("shelves shifting like tectonic plates, corridors folding inward"). Some elevated diction ("tectonic," "cartographers who mapped dreams") fits the mythic register though occasionally borders on overwriting. Information density is strong, with good variation in sentence structure and paragraph length.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong propulsion and varied syntax, especially in early passages. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "The platinum labyrinth waited at the village square, its metallic walls gleaming cold under a sky that refused to move." Minor template cadence in "She didn't... She walked... Her exile..." sequence near end.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("bone towers hummed with residual grief"). Some abstract scaffolding appears ("Forgiveness, she believed, should never be cheapened by simplicity") that could be cut. Information density is high in scene passages but thins during conceptual exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information-dense prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong image-making. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("crucible of collapse, gilded by grief, held together by intention") and some template phrasing ("She stood," "She took," "She knelt"). The extended metaphorical runs occasionally slow momentum but generally serve the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows moments of excellence ("The tide was rising outside, lapping at the cave's threshold like a tongue tasting its own edge") but suffers from occasional paraphrase loops, particularly around the mirror metaphor. Several abstract formulations ("temporary eternity," "borrowed glass") lack concrete grounding, though rhythm generally supports the meditative tone.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "vibration surged—not sound, but resonance, like a tuning fork struck against bone" demonstrate precise figurative language. However, repetitive structures appear ("She had... She believed... She descended...") and some passages contain ornamental description ("painting the sea in liquid gold") that slows momentum. The phrase "screaming tenderness" feels forced rather than organic to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments of textural specificity ("fingers tracing the patina bronze censer foot like a rosary"). Information density high in peak passages. Deductions for repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs and some abstract phrasing ("geography of loss," "lattices of meaning") that could be more concrete. Minor synonym churn around navigation/charting concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The glass eye, cool against her thigh" simultaneously provides sensory detail, object tracking, and emotional state. Some minor repetition in "occluded" variants but serves thematic purpose. Strong rhythm variation supports the contemplative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions—"collar turned up against the damp, eyes fixed on the water's edge" establishes character, atmosphere, and focus simultaneously. Some figurative density borders on overwriting ("opal dock," "pearlescent planks") but serves the story's ethereal tone. The closing image of Silas as "keeper of lights and losses" resonates without becoming precious.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting appears ("blooming at midsummer with phosphorescent fungi") and occasional abstraction ("doorway of decisions—the threshold he believed existed between regret and redemption"). The final image of glimmering ants as guides lands effectively, though some middle passages could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong sentence-level propulsion with varied rhythm matching emotional beats. Information density high: "her crown long pawned for bread" does multiple jobs efficiently. Some elevated diction ("astral light pooling in hollows like mercury wine") serves the lyric mode. Minor deduction for occasional density in metaphor clustering and slight repetition in the grotto description.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of crystalline prose ("burnt saffron, bruised indigo"). Information density high in descriptive passages. However, multiple instances of overwriting dilute impact: "scientifically romantic truth," "frequencies of his guilt, his relief, his raw, trembling honesty" shows template cadence. Some paraphrase loops around the concept of presence and revaluation. Filter-verb stacks in middle section ("She knew," "She had learned," "She didn't turn").

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("wind outside scrapes branches like quills against parchment"). Information density high in most passages. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("feral nostalgia—not sweet longing, but rabid, snarling recollections") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding, though some conceptual repetition around the jealousy theme.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("waiting like lungs between breaths") with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for template cadence runs ("She would..." repeated 4x in closing) and some paraphrase loops around "emotional terrain." No artifacts touch the closure beat itself.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several passages suffer from paraphrase loops ("The scars were still there. / But now, so was the story") and template constructions ("She did not rush. / She did not flinch"). The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity but accumulates enough redundancy to dull momentum, particularly in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong information density. Some overwriting in the electrical demonstration sequence with mixed metaphors (threads/serpents/fireflies). Template cadence appears briefly ("She'd laughed then. Now, she trembled"). The "sheet music archive just as the hush before the orchard's trees" opening is syntactically tangled.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the cosmic scope descriptions. Some abstract constructions strain clarity ("the still point around which all meaning orbits") and occasional template cadence in the "She'd seen/She'd done/She called it" sequence, but propulsion remains strong through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "pistons sighing steam into the dawn like a sleeping beast exhaling." Some repetitive phrasing around "razor edges" and occasional abstract philosophizing ("the yielding of potential to fact") creates minor drag. The countdown structure and varied paragraph lengths create good visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "caps pulsing like slow heartbeats" and effective rhythm variation. However, several abstract constructions dilute momentum ("allowing the self to become permeable," "permissions," "act of expansion") and there's repetition around "letting go" concepts. The filtering through Aris's spatial gift creates unique phrasing but occasionally becomes overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("monitors beeping like slot machines"). However, several abstract passages lack concrete grounding, and some phrases feel overwrought ("clover melancholy," "lucid contradictions"). The density of figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information-dense prose with strong sensory specificity ("air tasted of iron and ozone"), though abstract philosophizing creates occasional loops ("endings needed to be taught how to begin—through missteps, through echoes, through the grace of unintended intimacy"). Template cadence appears in the vignette sequence but serves the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, with vivid specificity in "walnut ink" and "silver grain" photography. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for figurative density that occasionally obscures clarity ("perfume of haunted euphoria"), some abstract phrasing ("regenerated covenant" appears without sufficient grounding), and minor repetition of "proximate causes" without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("draped in ivy like a forgotten cathedral") but some overwriting in figurative density. Template cadence appears in middle exchanges ("Someone claimed... Another swore...") and filter-verb clustering ("watched, sipping"). Information density is high when describing traded stories, though some philosophical framing ("symbols, when catalyzed correctly") edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some passages lean toward overwriting ("quiet blaze of her own pulse, steady and unafraid"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing and mild template cadence in the "She [verb]" patterns mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information-dense prose where lines like "she unscrewed the cap now, not to write, but to listen" advance multiple story dimensions. Some figurative density in peak moments ("entropy's cruel editing," "emotional mass") approaches overwriting, and phrases like "contingent relationships" appear multiple times without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though several metaphors strain credibility ("voice never rose above a breath yet carried the weight of cathedral bells"). Some repetitive constructions appear ("She signed...She mapped...She disrupted"). The fragment-heavy middle section works structurally but occasionally feels mannered rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("volcanic tenderness" simultaneously characterizes setting, theme, and psychology), though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("analytical intuition," "institutional indifference"). The "we promised you would remember" inscription and singing archive payoff land with strong propulsion, but occasional register elevation ("curry of the unspoken") creates mild friction.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and rhythm. Information density high in most passages. However, some overwriting in figurative language ("auroras trapped in glass," "iron to a magnet") and occasional template cadence in the "She drummed for..." sequence, though it builds purposeful momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong sensory specificity and varied syntax, particularly in sound descriptions. Information density high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some elevated diction ("calibrated ears," "residual warmth") occasionally drifts from Lena's working-class register but doesn't obscure clarity. Clean prose with good momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("hooded and motionless beneath the rusted awning, spiralingly calm"). Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from embodied action ("hope's geometry," "synopsis's first note"). Excellent varied sentence structure and purposeful paragraph breaks that control pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with purposeful compression, but several passages suffer from abstract phrasing ("amplified quiet of minds choosing differently") and mixed metaphors (grotto as child, rebellion as forest). Template cadence appears in the town-wide reaction sequence. The "She heard/She'd/She" repetition creates rhythm but borders on mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied syntax, particularly in water immersion sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("mend souls," "carry hope") and some register elevation that could be more grounded. The prose serves the mythic tone but sometimes reaches for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density, though some repetitive structures appear ("They whittled," "They'd," "They knew"). The "remade hush" and turbine descriptions effectively layer meaning, but occasional abstract phrases like "morally ambiguous, emotionally void" lean toward telling rather than embodying.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high density with lines like "verses she'd smuggled in dreams during the long ban" doing multiple jobs. Some repetitive constructions appear ("She stepped," "She moved," "She reached," "She traced") and occasional abstraction dilutes immediacy ("aesthetically driven," "savage need"), but overall momentum and imagery remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("arms crossed, amused by his innocently cunning persistence" characterizes while advancing). Some figurative density in opening paragraph, but rhythm varies purposefully with shorter sentences during action ("The rosemary twitched") creating momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of exceptional clarity ("cobalt for longing, amber for comfort, violet for grief held without breaking") but suffers from paraphrase loops, particularly in the philosophical questions that restate similar ideas about connection and technology. Some passages like "not to walk with feet, but with questions" feel overwrought, and the density of figurative language occasionally obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The observatory held no clocks, no calendars; time pooled here like spilled ink"). Some metaphor density in places ("grief had scraped her soul to marrow") but generally controlled. Minor repetition of "coordinates" and "offerings" serves thematic purpose. The line "That was enough" provides effective understated closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"thunder rolled like a forgotten bassline beneath the city's new quiet" establishes atmosphere while reinforcing the silence theme. Some figurative density approaches overwriting ("cathedral of collated whispers") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor template cadence appears in the "She'd measure..." sequence but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of compression ("Not war, not plague, but surrender") alternate with occasional overwriting ("twilight seeped through the fractured dome above, painting the bronze prism pagoda in hues of molten regret and violet surrender"). Information density varies—some sentences do multiple jobs while others hover in description. Minor template cadence appears in "She had come not for... She had deciphered... She had lost" but doesn't pervade. The piece maintains momentum despite these friction points.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.5)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("luminous river of shared consciousness") without clear payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("She replayed it. Slowed it. Zoomed.") but creates purposeful rhythm. Minor scaffold in transitions ("She smiled, small and sad").

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. Information density high in reconstruction sequence. Deductions for occasional abstraction loops ("conviction—once sturdy as oak—had cracked like thin ice"), some filter-heavy passages in middle third, and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages that could be more direct.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "violet light crept over the tower's eastern sill" and strong information density. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("displaced miracle," "fossilized roots," "symmetric satisfaction") and some metaphor clustering in high-pressure moments reduces clarity. The repeated "not... but" construction becomes noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density and varied rhythm, though figurative language occasionally over-accumulates ("hushed thunder," "ghost of piano keys"). The lengthy compound sentences in paragraphs 20-24 could tighten. No major loops or scaffolding, but some abstract phrasing ("unused love belongs—not in vaults, but in motion") could ground more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend the piece effectively. Some template cadence in middle sections ("She [verb]" patterns) and occasional abstraction ("stifled genius," "trapped creativity") that could be more concrete. Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty despite minor redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with evocative imagery and varied syntax, but occasional overwriting ("ash-carved into the earth's skin") and density issues where figurative language accumulates without advancing pressure. The piece maintains momentum despite conceptual complexity, though some metaphors strain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in sensory passages: "maple sighs, pine whispers, oak groans, all rendered in metallic harmonics." Some elevated diction in philosophical moments ("sacred untamed corridors where thought still ran free") creates mild register drift. Prose generally propels forward with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with purposeful cadence and varied syntax, though occasional overwriting appears ("twisted like question marks," "soft, watchful, tender as a mother's hand"). Some template repetition in "They [verb]" constructions (-0.4) but information density remains high through compressed imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though several instances of ornamental language ("frozen hymn," "cobalt fortress") and abstract phrasing ("safety's suffocating cost") accumulate. The prose maintains momentum but occasional overwriting in descriptive passages ("dust danced in the chandelier's glow") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose density serves the accumulative mode well: "She moved like ink bleeding through parchment" layers metaphor with plot mechanics. Some repetitive structures appear ("She did not..." patterns) but rhythm generally propels.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments of propulsive clarity ("Below, through silt and gloom, bioluminescent coral spiraled upward") alternate with explanatory passages that slow momentum. Several paraphrase loops appear ("Paths hadn't disappeared. They'd submerged.") and some metaphors strain ("edges frayed like nerve endings"), though the closure sequence maintains clean urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some metaphors strain ("firebanked under treaties and tired sighs"). The prose exhibits strong syntactic variety and momentum, but occasional overwriting appears ("subsonic growl that shook dust from the rafters and rattled loose bolts into clattering percussion"). No significant loops or scaffolding, and the final image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the vines that both restrain and steady, steam as breath and witness). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure support the accumulative design. Deductions for occasional abstract passages ("destiny unchosen is no destiny at all") and some elevated register drift in peak moments, though the prose remains largely propulsive and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong moments like "wind halts mid-sigh, leaves pause their rustle" with good rhythm variation. Some repetitive structures ("I return," "I come," "I carry") and filter constructions ("I see," "I find") reduce immediacy. Information density is generally high with purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of brilliance ("corridors stretched too long, voices arrived before lips moved") but suffers from density issues - multiple metaphors per sentence in high-pressure beats without clear payoff. Some purple passages ("luminescent ache of transformation") and abstract phrasing reduce clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong moments like "serene anger—not rage, not despair, but a quiet, molten fury" demonstrate controlled prose. However, repetitive "not X, but Y" constructions appear throughout, creating template cadence. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("labyrinth of synaptic time") without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with evocative imagery and varied sentence structure, but several template patterns emerge ("She had...", "She knew...", "She placed..."). Some metaphors strain (truth "nested in limbic systems") and the aftermath section contains repetitive constructions that diminish momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the sandbag holding "more than weight—it held memory, gravity, the hush of descent"). Some beautiful specific imagery throughout. Deduction for occasional overwriting in figurative language ("petals unfurling in slow, silent prayer") and slight redundancy in explaining the knife's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("rail spike she'd salvaged from a collapsed sky-rail, its iron still vibrating with the ghost of trains that once carried prayers"). Strong verb choices and concrete imagery maintain momentum, with only minor redundancy in describing the constellations' grief.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high in the telescope sequence. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "smoldering like embers beneath a blanket of mist," some repetitive phrasing around "truth" and "silence," and occasional register drift into overly literary territory ("epitaph," "Q.E.D."). The metaphor density in places obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagistic density and purposeful rhythm, but several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("Static dissolved into sighs. Screams unraveled into yawns" restates transformation). Template cadence appears in final section with repetitive "She [verb]" structures. Information density remains high despite these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control and information density but suffers from recurring abstract phrases ("lilac unease" appears twice, "emergent hush" multiple times) and occasional overwriting in figurative language. The mandala sequence maintains good momentum despite density, though some sentences could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "tessera of a new mosaic, one she would assemble not on walls, but in law, in gesture, in breath" show purposeful rhythm, but repetitive "She renamed" constructions create template cadence. Several paraphrase loops appear ("Mercy, she decided, must no longer ask permission to act. It must break doors.") and abstract philosophizing occasionally stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, and the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("her voice turned grief into lilac mist"). However, template cadence appears in the three-echo sequence, some metaphors strain ("threading her essence through time's fraying edges"), and occasional paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("The ghost's form thinned, her edges blurring").

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with vivid technical-poetic fusion, but template cadence appears in middle sections ("She + verb" patterns) and some paraphrase loops ("It was crude. It was brilliant. It was the only way"). Filter verbs cluster in exploration sequences, though the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong information density. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("existential purpose," "factually mystical") and some elevated diction in peak beats ("lattice above her thickened"). The fossil transformation sequence maintains clarity despite complexity. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with purposeful repetition creating rhythm ("She spun," "Sand fell," "Buttons gleamed"). Effective variation in sentence structure and paragraph length. Deductions for abstract phrasing loops around "truth unraveling" (appears 4 times without added specificity) and some elevated diction in peak moments that creates mild register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("her name no longer ash, but compost"). Deductions for occasional overwriting ("silver hush" appears twice) and some template cadence in middle paragraphs ("She had been... She walked... She had spent"). Information density is good but uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of sensory precision ("drip-tick of gutters," "glint of a heron's wing") alternate with overwritten passages that strain metaphor ("bones had grown roots into the rhythm"). Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("not for mending cloth, but for unpicking"; "not to simplify, but to clarify"; "not from cold, but resonance"). The philosophical abstractions ("ambient awareness," "palimpsest promise") occasionally obstruct momentum, though the closing sequence maintains propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs. Minor figurative density in places ("dunes that shifted like liquid regret") but pattern-taught and purposeful. Clean propulsion through varied syntax, no loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with effective variation in sentence structure and purposeful imagery. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("protected vulnerability" concept repeated, "quivering hush" reiterated without advancement). Some overwrought metaphors ("spilled mercury," "crimson sigh") approach purple prose without quite crossing into confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong propulsion and varied rhythm, particularly in crisis sequence ("ran, not to save scrolls...but to secure"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for template cadence runs ("She had seen...She had not...She did not"), abstract terminology clusters ("coexistence," "sovereignty," "independence"), and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly strong in descriptive passages. However, several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("the thread that connects all things" repeats without embodiment). Some figurative density in non-pressure moments ("dream carved in alabaster") doesn't always advance story, though the lyrical mode justifies much of the ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high in technical passages. However, some metaphorical density ("tuning a poisoned violin," "stars and turn their lies into lullabies") and occasional template phrases ("allowed herself half a smile") slightly diminish impact.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, but figurative density occasionally obscures clarity ("blueprint of spatial mutiny—the rebellion of space against its own boundaries"). Some passages edge toward overwriting with stacked modifiers, and the abstract ending phrases ("cartographer of possibility") lack the story's earlier concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean, propulsive prose with varied syntax and strategic fragments building momentum. Information density high—most lines advance multiple story elements. Some mild repetition in the "She didn't"/"Didn't" sequences, but largely purposeful for rhythm. The final image lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("glaciers wept into steam," "compass needles caught in a ghost's grip") and good rhythmic variation. Multiple instances of template cadence ("It was memory. It was grief. It was the drowned sailors") and some overwriting in figurative density during high-pressure beats. The paraphrase loop around "nervously confident" appears twice with similar phrasing. Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose ("golden and slow, as if dawn itself were being rewound").

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("mist like smoke through pine needles," "Permission to begin again, even if the beginning was cracked, fragmented, half-developed") but accumulates abstract loops around concepts of forgiveness and amnesty. Template structures appear ("He thought of...," "He felt...," "He knew...") and the extended reflection on pixelated amnesty in mid-story paraphrases rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("Why run when you can reroute?"/"why do some paths circle back?"/"And always, he returned to the question"), and abstract philosophizing sometimes replaces concrete imagery. The "perceptively calm" phrase feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, particularly effective in the dream sequence's shorter, more urgent constructions. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("stars spoke in burdens, not light" followed immediately by more star metaphors) and occasional template constructions ("She'd spent years learning to..."). Information density is high but occasionally tips into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "She walked toward the center, her guarded heart a fortress of moss and marrow." Some overwriting in metaphor density ("petals like shards of stained glass spiraling around her") but clarity remains. Minor template cadence in "She saw" repetition serves pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose shows strong control of rhythm and imagery, with effective variation in sentence length and structure. Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple purposes. However, there's noticeable repetition of conceptual language ("eclipsed," "covenant," "dreams") that begins to feel like synonym churn, and some metaphors strain coherence ("time-rift stitched with static and smoke").

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths creating breath between dense imagery. Information density high—"oak whose roots coiled around a child's pelvis" does triple work establishing setting, stakes, and tone. Some figurative density in opening paragraph ("lovers reconciling after war") though it establishes pattern. Clean prose overall with purposeful fragments like "Not surrender—seedling."

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "gravel like a beast chewing stone" and varied sentence rhythms. Some filter verb clusters ("he sensed," "he felt") and mild repetition of "he'd" constructions in middle sections reduce immediacy without pattern-teaching purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("seed pressed to soil that wasn't soil but solidified memory") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphors ("haunted knot," "needle through silk") occasionally muddle clarity. Template cadence appears in "She + verb" constructions but not pervasively enough to severely damage momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression, with lines like "She smiled, not with lips, but with soul" demonstrating control. However, density issues emerge in stacked metaphors ("cathedral of salt and starlight, cradle of migrating selves, keeper of wonders") and some paraphrase loops ("wonder doesn't die—it molts, it moves, it migrates" restates without adding pressure). The text maintains clarity but occasionally privileges ornament over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with most lines serving multiple functions, though occasional overwriting appears ("the fragile pause between fear and surrender"). Strong propulsion through confession sequence with effective paragraph variation. Some metaphorical density in non-peak moments ("cathedral of compression") without clear payoff, and minor register elevation that doesn't fully match the inspector's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Multiple instances of paraphrase loops ("She documented it all—not for posterity, but for precision" followed by extended documentation description). Some template cadence in middle sections with repeated "She [verb]" constructions that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—the watch description simultaneously establishes object, history, and current sensation. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor template moments ("She stepped through," "She lifted," "She did not vanish") in the closing sequence, but the pattern feels intentional rather than artifactual.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, with lines like "perforations in the empire's story now a conduit for truth" doing multiple jobs. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("gilded cage," "stolen relics," "silenced histories") and occasional abstract phrasing ("propagated," "resonance") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Stalactites of condensed skylight dripped slow photons onto the floor" simultaneously establishes setting, atmosphere, and the magical realism register. Strong verb choices ("hovering," "coaxing," "infuse") and specific nouns avoid generic descriptors. Sentence variety creates natural rhythm without algorithmic patterns. Minor density issues in abstract passages ("rhythm of pause, the hidden architecture of cessation") don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the grotto sequence. Information density is high without becoming opaque. Deductions for repetitive "she [verb]" constructions in several passages and some abstract phrasing ("vessel not for sorrow") that dulls immediacy. The extended metaphorical language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high—most lines advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. Some abstract phrasing ("protected vulnerability," "armor shed so softer truths could breathe") and occasional register drift reduce clarity in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the description of ripples as "temporal notation." Some phrases approach purple prose ("the sycamore hush settled like dust") and occasional repetition ("sycamore hush" appears three times) creates minor drag, but information density remains solid with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with moments of genuine beauty ("black as obsidian shards," "physics dressed in reverence"). Some repetitive phrasing around "centuries" and "dust" creates minor loops. Template cadence appears in middle sections ("It did not... It did not... It simply knew") though this reads as intentional parallelism for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "the mist curled around his ankles like an invitation." Deductions for register drift into elevated diction ("haloed the spire's eaves") and occasional overwriting in the cloud-tree sequence. Some synonym churn around magic/enchantment/spells. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"sky lanterns drifted upward, their paper bellies glowing like drowned stars reborn" establishes setting, tone, and central metaphor simultaneously. Sentence variety creates effective rhythm shifts between contemplative passages and action sequences. Some abstract phrasing ("truth hides behind truth") could ground more concretely, and occasional elevated diction ("signifying") risks pretension.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, particularly in the vision sequence. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Some metaphorical density borders on over-writing ("stellar doubt that pulsed behind her ribs like a dying pulsar") and occasional abstract passages slow momentum. The final image lands with clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing atmosphere or emotion. Deductions for repetitive "echo" constructions, some abstract grief-language that could be more concrete, and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages ("broken teeth biting into twilight").

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (world-building, character, atmosphere). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("cosmic ledgers," "celestial equilibrium") but remains within the piece's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("rooftops breached the waterline like the knuckles of a drowning man") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("He began to spin...," "He set up...," "He'd spun them..."). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum (memory/remembrance concepts reiterated). The "midnight ridgeway at twilight" creates temporal confusion that disrupts clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("silver-barked trees" establishes both setting and otherworldliness). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("brushstrokes in a divine canvas, each turn a verse in a hymn older than language") and some phrases repeat conceptually ("touch of wonder" echoes across multiple paragraphs).

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, like "the wind rose, cool and clean, carrying no message but the memory of what silence could mean." Some repetition of "burden" and "weight" concepts appears but serves the accumulative design. The opening and closing images of the Watcher's position create effective bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages like "becoming no one so he could feel everything." However, several abstract philosophical passages ("the tension between what was lost and what might yet be") and repetitive constructions around "complementary opposites" create minor density issues. The final sequences achieve good momentum despite occasional overwriting in the metaphysical descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages like "black as pitch and glistening like wet obsidian." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing atmosphere, character, or theme simultaneously. Minor issues include occasional abstraction ("innovation could breathe") and some repetitive constructions around the seed's mystery, but no significant loops or scaffolding mars the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful repetition that builds resonance ("He sings to the walls. He sings to the wind."). Information density high in most passages. Deduction for template cadence in places ("He knows... They see... They hear...") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "shelves that stretched into forever" and effective rhythm variation. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("foggy lucidity of the in-between," "interiorized exteriors") and occasional opacity reduce momentum. Some repetitive structures in the middle section ("It had swallowed... swallowed... swallowed") work as pattern but slightly diminish variety.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the ritual sequence where short observations punctuate longer descriptions. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers of meaning. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("not...but" appears 15+ times), some paraphrase loops ("Creative destruction was never the end. It was the first true beginning"), and occasional purple prose that obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures create momentum, with purposeful fragments and parallelism in the climactic sequence. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("negative space," "fabric between moments") and some repetitive constructions ("She didn't... She...") accumulate to prevent higher scoring despite the vivid final transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Strong moments like "bioluminescent eels swam in synchronized orbits above his head, tracing equations he didn't need to solve—only to feel." Deductions for abstract phrases ("permanent transience" appears multiple times), some template constructions ("He didn't X. Didn't Y."), and occasional register drift into technical language.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean, propulsive prose with varied sentence structures and strong rhythm control. Information density high throughout. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("texture of connection" appears multiple times) and slight repetition in description patterns, though these support the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance world-building, character, and theme simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("invisible lace draped across spacetime") but serves the conceptual complexity. Minor template cadence in middle teaching sections ("She turned...She activated...She placed") slightly dulls momentum. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend the piece's central transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery. However, several instances of overwriting ("bruised twilight into liquid gold puddles," "voice low as falling ash") and some abstract phrasing reduce momentum. The opening is particularly dense with figurative language that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong sensory specificity ("Dust and salt coated her tongue") and varied sentence rhythms create momentum. However, some overwrought phrases ("clock was liquid, relentless") and occasional abstract elevations ("weight of return," "metaphysical") create mild density issues without pattern-teaching their elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/atmosphere), though some abstract phrasing around "ephemeral patterns" and "language of collapse and reassembly" edges toward opacity. Clean grammar and varied syntax support rhythm. Minor deduction for conceptual abstractions that could be more concrete, particularly in the defragmentation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose achieves high density with lines like "dissolved like salt in rain" and "echoes that slept for generations stirred, peeled from the walls like old parchment." Information layers efficiently—the diamond both preserves the curse and enables the solution. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, but suffers from overwriting in places—mixed metaphors ("bent local physics like origami") and occasional template cadence in listing sequences. The "static erupted—not noise, but language" section shows strong rhythmic control, while some figurative language feels forced ("lullabies sung by black holes").

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some ornamental phrases approach overwriting ("wind-chimes woven from moonlight"). Template cadence appears in middle sections ("She played...She shifted...She walked"). Information density is high when focused on transformation scenes, but some descriptive passages could compress further without losing effect.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong moments ("each revolution echoing like a skipped heartbeat") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Some mixed metaphors ("stitching absences," "smuggling hope," "linking" all compete). The "learned to fly" ending risks sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("silence became a chorus," "cathedral of whimsy"). Minor template cadence in middle sections ("He would...He would...") costs momentum but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages drift toward purple prose ("spiraling bookshelves that curved upward into impossible vaults"). The harmonic intervals sung as "Riemannian manifolds" shows controlled inventiveness despite occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in world-building passages that simultaneously advance plot and atmosphere. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("luminous absence—filled, at last") approaches overwriting but remains legible. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph structure support momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple functions. However, some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("twilight bled into indigo"), and occasional abstract phrasing ("hush of cosmic possibility") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Glass panes, half-buried in silt and coral, still refracted..."). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, though occasional abstract phrasing ("vacancy — memories stolen") slightly reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"She walks backwards to her chair, spine straight, eyes sharp, heart quiet" simultaneously conveys movement, posture, and emotional state. Some metaphorical density borders on over-saturation ("shard-mirror," "fractured like her own reflection") but syntax varies purposefully to support the recursive structure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (the waterfall is both setting and dimensional threshold). However, abstract phrasing around "essence" and "wonder" occasionally dulls immediacy, particularly "Essence of joy. Essence of surprise." sequence that lists rather than embodies. Some elevated diction ("upon the hush," "verdant parapet") risks register drift but serves the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks create visual rhythm, with information density high in lines like "each knot a name, each strand a life pulled too soon from the sea's cold grip." Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from the established voice ("cathedral of captured starlight," "liquid whispers"), and mild redundancy appears in explaining the sanctuary's properties. Line-level control remains strong through the crucial guilt-knot sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("each droplet a metronome marking the slow collapse of memory into moss"). Some synonym loops around silence/absence/void concepts and occasional abstract phrasing ("shielded openness, heart unarmored yet guarded") create minor drag. The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("ocean currents whispered like librarians shushing the deep"). Some figurative density in emotional beats approaches overwriting ("hollow and humming, the wind now warm") but doesn't obscure closure. Minor template cadence in the "It's mass converting to light. It's love persisting as pattern" sequence. Strong propulsion through varied syntax despite occasional elevated diction.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the encoded messages that advance plot while revealing character. Some figurative density in peak beats ("harmonic ribbons," "syncopated rhythm") without clear payoff. Minor template cadence in "First stroke... Second... Third..." structure, though it serves the encoding pattern. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("She was not merely climbing ten floors—she was ascending through memory"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor metaphor density in places ("wings," "liquid gold," "tiny lanterns") without clear pattern-teaching, and slight register elevation in final third ("proof that life persists").

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description + emotion + memory). Rhythm varies with scene needs—longer contemplative passages, shorter notations. Some figurative density in places ("frayed thread," "powdered memory") but serves the accumulative texture. Minor loops in cloud description patterns and some abstract emotional labeling reduce the score.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong syntactic variety and information density, with lines like "each groove translated to a brushstroke" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("ghost-light of dead astronomers") that borders on overwrought but serves the heightened tone. Minor repetition of "fractally precise" without full payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but some figurative density in non-peak moments ("murmurations...like living inkblots...like miniature dunes") and occasional redundancy ("diligently curious" stated rather than shown). Information density is high and momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The air hummed, not with magic, but memory—the driftwood nostalgia of lives half-lived"). Varied sentence structures create natural rhythm. Some mild repetition in mirror-description sequences, but generally clean prose with purposeful compression. The "not X, but Y" construction appears frequently but serves the thematic contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"Messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn. Not digital, not shouted—but handwritten, fragile, intimate." Minor overwriting appears in extended metaphors, but rhythm varies purposefully and no loops or scaffolding mar the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with most lines carrying multiple functions, and the prose maintains momentum through varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("bruised awe swelling in his chest"), some abstract phrasing ("nested patterns—fractal lullabies woven into clockwork spirals"), and filter constructions that could be more immediate. The closing sequence achieves strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("whistled—not a tune, but a sequence of pauses and pitches"). Strong syntactic variety and precise word choice. Minor repetition of "offhandedly exact" feels purposeful rather than artifactual.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("liquid gold," "watermark / Proof of contact"). However, repetitive sentence structures appear in clusters ("She'd spent years...," "She'd spent months...," "She traced...," "She scooped..."). Template cadence in the ending sequence ("She touched...," "She drove...," "She woke...") creates mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. Information density is high - most sentences advance both literal and thematic work. However, some abstract noun clusters like "glimmering parole" and "conditional release from the weight of memory" create opacity. The repeated "She [verb]" structure in the closing sequence creates mild template cadence that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but several instances of abstract phrasing dilute immediacy ("hollowed but whole," "petrichor and possibility"). Some figurative density in non-peak moments without clear payoff. The "sturdy brittle shell" oxymoron works but similar constructions accumulate. Information density is high and propulsion generally maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("boots echoing like metronome ticks against rusted rungs" = sound, comparison, texture, movement). Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (musical/temporal motifs throughout). Some elevated diction ("empathetically decisive," "calcify into silence") fits the lyrical mode, though occasional abstraction ("histories buried beneath chaff and concrete") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying both literal and metaphorical weight, though some passages loop conceptually ("She did not weep for the dreams; she modified them" followed by extended restatement). Template cadence appears in the "She had come..." / "She did not..." / "She modified..." sequence. The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("owls called in binary hoots") but occasionally strains metaphors beyond clarity ("helix-minded" never quite lands).

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Several instances of overwrought figurative language ("like a bat made of parchment," "sound like tearing silk") and repetitive use of "clandestinely luminous" variants. Template cadence appears in places ("She stepped...She seized it...She pressed...") though not pervasive enough for major penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language like "roots spiraled like frozen smoke" and "river deltas of sorrow" creates texture without overwhelming. However, repetitive structures appear ("He did not...but with," "not loud, not piercing, but deep") and some passages loop concepts (the final four paragraphs essentially restate the same insight about silence and potential).

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is moderate with purposeful rhythm variation, though several passages loop conceptually ("correlate," "translate silence" appear repetitively). The prose occasionally strains for profundity ("fractures let in light—and sometimes, magnetic fields") at the expense of clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose shows strong information density and varied rhythm but suffers from overwriting in places—"vault of stars," "petrified silence," "spectral halos." Some metaphors strain credibility (hummingbird vertebrae in a clasp). The piece maintains momentum but occasionally prioritizes poetic effect over clarity, particularly in abstract passages about empathy and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("flower unfurled like a velvet scream") but contains repetitive structures ("She didn't seek... She sought"). Some abstract phrasing ("undercurrent of wisdom") appears multiple times. Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong poetic density with lines doing multiple jobs: "branches unrooted from earth and reached for the sky" conveys both action and metaphor. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "It sang...It echoed" sequence and the extended "Waiting for" repetition. Some fragments like "Warm. Thrumming." work rhythmically but accumulate slightly past optimal density.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs (description advancing both atmosphere and technical understanding). Strong verb choices and varied sentence structures create natural rhythm. Minor repetition of "wind" could be varied, but prose remains clean and propulsive throughout with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.8)
    Severe overwriting pervades the piece with mixed metaphors ("spectral notation," "liquid sapphire," "velvet pressure") appearing in most sentences without payoff. Template cadence runs throughout ("She [verb], [participial phrase]"). Paraphrase loops are frequent—the concept of "unfettering" and "certifying wonder" restates without advancement. The density of figurative language actively obscures the action, particularly in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.7)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"gilded reed flute...brittle as old vows, yet humming with residual resonance" combines description, history, and potential. Some minor repetition occurs ("keeper" variations) but serves thematic purpose. Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but some paraphrase loops appear ("deliberate ambiguity" concept restated multiple times). Template cadence emerges in the "She never.../She didn't..." constructions. The mathematical metaphors occasionally strain coherence ("collapsed empathy-space"), though the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"jittery" establishes character while "aurora-lit ridgeway" sets scene and tone simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("germinate," "sympathetically") fits the fantastical register. Slight deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("across the fade from memory to myth").

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied sentence structure, particularly in the vision sequence. Information density is high in key passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("truthful lie," "wore briefly then returned with reverence"), some filter-verb clustering ("She felt," "She saw," "She knew"), and purple-prose moments that slow momentum without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong imagistic density but suffers from repetitive constructions—"raveling silence" appears four times, "stoically sparkling" three times, creating echo loops. Information density remains high with lines like "threading not wool, but strands of twilight and wind-chime echoes" doing multiple jobs. Some ornamental phrases ("luminous glyphs," "harmonic resonance") edge toward purple without quite tipping over.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("fruit-laden trees rooted in floating soil, their roots dangling through arches into nothing"), though some paraphrase loops appear ("to coax resilience from rubble, to prove that what was buried could still rise"). The final sequence from "He didn't need the silk anymore" forward shows exemplary propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The green shard flared, then dimmed—not broken, but fulfilled"). Varied sentence structures and rhythmic control. Deduction for occasional overwriting in metaphorical density ("film peeling from reality's surface") and some register drift into abstract philosophical territory that occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("bruised twilight sky," "cobalt blue, worn soft by tides"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of elevated diction ("spectral glow," "velvet dark," "luminescent") create mild register drift, and there's light redundancy in explaining the letter chain system.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure moments with dense figurative language that obscures rather than clarifies ("bent possibility, nudging the arc of human longing toward wonder instead of weariness"). Multiple paraphrase loops restate the same concepts ("stories were older than ink, older than stone"). The piece prioritizes lyrical density over narrative momentum, creating beautiful but static prose.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specific detail and good information density. Template cadence appears in lines 13-15 with repeated "She [verb]" structures (-0.4). Some paraphrase loops around magnetism concepts in the middle third (-0.2). Final passages achieve excellent propulsion with concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in discovery sequences ("how roots remember screams, how bark absorbs whispered confessions"). Some repetitive structures ("She saw how...How...How" tripling) and abstract phrases ("resonance," "mundane miracles") create minor drag, though the prose generally propels with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("dew-kissed moss that glowed faintly") and good rhythm variation. However, some passages edge toward overwriting ("apricot, rose, and honey-gold") and there's occasional abstraction ("rhythm of belonging"). The final paragraph contains some scaffold phrasing ("breath by breath, note by note").

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("liquid silver" moonlight), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("holding space for stories"), and minor template cadence in the middle section with repetitive "She had..." constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful variation in sentence length and structure, creating natural rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, or theme simultaneously. Some abstract phrases ("grammar of absolution," "quiet rebellions") edge toward purple prose but don't overwhelm. The closing image effectively recharges earlier motifs without overexplaining.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting/character/theme). Some template cadence in the vow descriptions ("One vow...Another...She found a third") and slight synonym churn around "measure/sample/record." Prose clarity and momentum remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"lanterns swaying like drunken fireflies" establishes setting while conveying instability. Some figurative density in places ("silence thicker now, like tar poured over whispers") but serves the atmosphere. Clean prose with varied sentence structures that maintain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("shimmering aurora that pulsed like a slow, celestial heartbeat"), some abstract phrasing around "emergent compass," and slight register drift in academic terms like "mycelial networks." No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but elevated diction occasionally obscures ("mnemonically sovereign," "resonance") and some metaphor mixing occurs ("memories like tombstones" shifts to "flood" to "uncork"). Template phrasing appears in "She remembers...She spent years...She needs it to" construction. No major loops but rhythmic monotony in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with vivid sensory detail. Information density is high—most sentences advance discovery or deepen atmosphere. Some figurative density in peak moments ("pooled like rain in hidden aquifers") and occasional abstract phrasing ("candor in small moments, preserved like pressed petals") reduce immediacy. The "drop by drop, word by word" ending uses template parallelism.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "calibrated to strike only when atmospheric pressure, temperature, and emotional gravity aligned." However, abstract phrases like "meteorology of soul" and "emotional gravity" edge toward purple prose. Some repetitive structures appear ("She'd smile then," "She'd pause," "The tuner nodded") creating mild template cadence that doesn't quite warrant the full penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though occasional overwriting ("frantic cursive against the glass," "fireflies made of dread") and some template patterns in the middle section. The final passages achieve genuine momentum with "petals—real, physical petals—drifted from its chest cavity."

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "trapped wing" envelope, but several template constructions ("She didn't... She simply waited") and repetitive "She didn't" openings. The "organic exhale" metaphor strains logic within the established realistic world.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("corroded consoles whispering in static hymns") but suffers from density overload and occasional mixed metaphors. Template cadence appears in middle sections ("Glyph One: dissolve... Glyph Three: purge..."). Information density is high but sometimes sacrifices clarity for atmospheric effect.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("knelt beside her workbench, fingers trembling not from cold but from the gravity pockets"). Strong verb choices and varied syntax create natural rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("gleaming silence," "memory as sedimentary gravity") and one instance of elevated register ("exhumed meaning"), but overall momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("constellations shaped like lullabies") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence carries figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("not as warrior, not as savior, but as listener"), and abstract compounds like "terrestrially cosmic" obscure rather than clarify.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong opening image and propulsive sentences like "The building knew she was coming. And it had stories to tell." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some mild overwriting in metaphorical descriptions ("fleeting silver scars," "velvet-lined cigar box") that don't quite justify their weight, though they support atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("memories go to be quarantined—locked away not by force, but by the soul's own mercy") but suffers from abstract passages about "resonance structures" and "geometries of grief" that slow momentum. Some phrases like "charmed skeptic" feel forced rather than organic. Filter verbs accumulate in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with strong sensory specificity, but hampered by the repetitive "as stalactites drip" construction and some overwritten passages. Mixed metaphors appear ("sanctuary trembled; fissures bloomed") and elevated diction sometimes drifts from the established voice ("calibrated treason in her marrow"). The prose scaffolding around the magical elements lacks the precision of the character work.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong rhythmic control in passages like "She sang of children who never got to say goodbye" but hampered by abstract loops ("echoes were not reflections but residues"), elevated diction drift ("serpentine nexus," "emotional payload"), and some template cadence in the middle revelations. Information density is high when concrete but dulled by philosophical abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong sentence-level propulsion with varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm, particularly in the dream-cameo listings and the final ripple effects. Information density is high with most lines serving multiple functions (character, atmosphere, theme). Deduction for two instances of mild overwriting ("bleeds violet over the glacier's crown," "ancient, blue-veined ice") and one paraphrase loop ("windows of connection—that's what the ghost whisperer calls them").

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density is high with most lines advancing atmosphere or theme, but figurative language appears too frequently ("like starlight caught in a spider's thread" followed immediately by "luminous, yet heavy"). Template cadence emerges in "She + verb" patterns across multiple paragraphs. The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but needs pruning of ornamental phrases that don't constrain choice.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, though figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("The Stillborn Star," "spat out madness"). Template cadence appears in the final third with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions across four consecutive paragraphs. Information flow maintains momentum despite some abstract phrasing ("reassembled truth humming in her ribs").

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("cobalt light spiraled outward, not as a weapon, but as a carrier wave"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("The storm wasn't weather—it was a veil" followed by similar metaphorical assertions). Template cadence emerges in the "She [verb]" pattern across multiple paragraphs, though the lyrical texture partially compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally strong prose with vivid phrases like "salt-wind slipping through cracks...like a whispered secret" and precise verb choices, but some passages lean toward overwriting ("sonic reliquaries," "vagrant penny poet" repeated) and the middle section summarizes exchanges that could be dramatized. The syntactic variety supports the lyric mode, though occasional purple patches ("positively wistful, endlessly bright") strain against the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in peak beats ("azure-coat," "logically emotional to her marrow," "sonic absolution"). Template cadence emerges in parallel structures ("She adapted... She had protected... she had reminded"). Mixed metaphors blur sense (ice simultaneously groans, sings, sighs, and screams). The phrase "logically emotional" appears three times, creating unnecessary repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("iron bones gleaming under a sky still bruised with storm memory") but suffers from repetitive structural patterns ("She had learned...She slept...She never claimed"). Information density is high but momentum occasionally stalls in conceptual passages rather than maintaining sensory grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine power ("shadows stretch like reaching fingers") but suffers from periodic abstraction and some repetitive constructions. The phrase "memory-field" and similar compounds feel artificially technical. Several sentences in the middle section loop similar concepts about memory and trauma without advancing pressure. Information density is generally strong but inconsistent.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("silent ballerinas and frozen lullabies"), though some template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("He deserved... He deserved... He deserved"). Information density is good but occasional ornamental phrases ("brass cradle," "wrinkled hand") and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with purposeful compression: "She was steadily curious, never frantic, never bored; curiosity was her rudder, her compass, her anti-grav stabilizer." Strong verb choices and specific technical imagery throughout. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("reverence like static") and one instance of telling about absurdity rather than showing it.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing discovery or atmosphere. Some conceptual abstraction ("temporal not spatial," "resonance not record") requires re-reading. Template cadence appears in the final "She lies" sequence but serves rhythmic purpose. Minor metaphor strain with "mausoleum" servers that also "hum."

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery like "frost crunching," "mirrors caught the light, each one holding a fragment of courage." Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("map empathy onto action," "reconstitute purpose") and repetitive use of "weighted breath" formula reduce clarity. Some template cadence in the mirror-glimpse sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with strong moments ("like someone gripping reality loosely, as if it might slip through her fingers like silt"), but figurative density occasionally overwhelms, particularly in opening and climactic sections. Some template cadence in "She'd..." constructions and metaphor clustering reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some overwriting appears ("pavilion glowing like a lantern," "honeyed light"). Template cadence in dialogue tags and mild synonym churn around "mismatch/difference" concepts. The closing sequence from "The pavilion dimmed" forward achieves strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions that advance both setting and emotional state. Some repetitive phrasing around "clearing" and "echo" creates minor loops. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across 3-4 consecutive sentences. The prose maintains momentum despite these artifacts, with strong syntactic variety overall.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose achieves moments of precision ("chimney swifts darted in synchronized arcs, their wings slicing twilight"), but template cadence runs ("She opened...She traced...She lingered...She studied") create mechanical rhythm (-0.6). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines about healing and transformation, and abstract phrasing like "slow alchemy performed in solitude" lacks concrete anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "She transcribed them not in letters, but in glyphs of pressure and pause" advances method, character, and theme simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph rhythm. Minor repetition in "weathered innocence" phrase but serves thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"junkyard prophet squatted in the fog sculpture garden" establishes character, setting, and tone simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("moon on wave," "breath on glass") approaches overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in "He rose... He didn't know... Didn't know" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("tears crystallizing in low gravity, drifting like miniature moons") but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("luminous ache" appears three times) and abstract constructions that slow momentum. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("not to freeze...but to restructure," "not with gears...but by the sound") and some sentences strain for profundity over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the cataloging of mundane sounds that carry emotional weight. However, several instances of synonym loops appear ("fractured/broken," "hymning/singing/humming") and some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("like honey on warm toast, like salt on a lover's skin"). The closing achieves propulsion despite occasional template cadence in the middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.2)
    Some repetitive phrasing ("quietly deliberate" appears 3 times, "closing loops" repeated). Information density generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs. Clear propulsion through the seventeen-night sequence. Minor template cadence in middle section listing what she learned reduces momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of abstract phrasing weaken momentum: "threads spun from apology," "patterns that shimmered with meaning," "living threshold between despair and devotion." The opening and closing sentences land effectively, though middle sections occasionally favor conceptual language over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, repetitive phrase structures appear ("She had," "She would") creating template cadence in places. Some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("pearl of stillness") without full payoff. The prose maintains momentum but occasional overwriting ("reflectively vibrant" used three times) creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, though some figurative density in early paragraphs ("moss-choked threshold," "steel-gray ruin," "emerald moss"). Minor template cadence in "She had... She moved... She knelt" sequence. Strong final line recharges earlier motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("time pooled in eddies of forgotten breath") but suffers from repetitive structures in the middle catalog of hopes and some abstract phrasing ("invisible geometries of longing"). The paraphrase loop around "cameo appearances" appearing three times and slight template cadence in the encounter descriptions ("One man...A girl...An old woman") dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some elevated diction borders on purple ("velvet over stone," "latent music"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor issues: "spun golden stories" feels forced for the prompt element; some filter constructions ("She didn't force") could be more immediate. The closing image of the wreath as "sacred space—ready to be filled" lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"flash-paper alchemist" immediately establishes profession and paradox. Some figurative density in places ("thick as velvet," "velvet" for waiting) and minor register elevation, but strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph structure that mirrors the ritual's progression.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"frost clung like regret" establishes both setting and emotional register. Rhythm varies purposefully between longer accumulative passages and shorter declaratives like "He didn't flinch." Some figurative density in places ("mercury—elusive, toxic if grasped too directly") but serves the oblique-perception theme. Minor repetition of "echo" concept but functions as pattern rather than loop.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative control ("whalebone reverie, soft and hollow and heavy") with varied syntax. Information density high—most sentences carry multiple functions. Deductions for repetitive "calcify" variants (8 instances) creating mild template cadence, and slight overwriting in metaphor density during the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("rain-beaded skylight," "fine as a lion's whisker") with strong information density. However, paraphrase loops appear ("grief had crystallized...something hauntingly practical" echoes the prompt), and some metaphors strain ("lens" extended across multiple paragraphs).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and purposeful compression, but some overwriting appears ("kinetic lagoon," "resolute scavenger," "calcified laughter"). Template cadence emerges in the "I regret" sequence and the metaphor density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple layers (character, setting, theme), particularly in action sequences like the steam redirection. However, several passages contain conceptual loops ("maze of intentions" repeated without development) and abstract philosophizing that slows momentum. The prose occasionally strains for effect with mixed metaphors ("breath returned to a corpse") that don't quite land.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.2)
    While prose shows moments of beauty, several phrases edge toward purple ("trembling like unborn stars," "composer of stillness") and the text occasionally loops concepts (multiple "bore" constructions, repeated silence/hush imagery). Information density is generally strong but some passages feel overwrought, particularly in describing the crystal.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density strong with lines doing multiple jobs—"brass worn smooth by generations who trusted shadows more than clocks" delivers object detail, history, and thematic setup simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("cathedral" of quiet, "tuned strings") but coherent to the architectural theme. Minor repetitive stems in "He had..." openings but pattern serves accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fingers gnarled like driftwood," "pebbles rolling in a receding wave"). Template cadence appears in the knot-learning section with repeated "The [name]" structures. Some paraphrase loops around patience and waiting concepts. Information density high in dialogue exchanges but occasionally diluted in transitional passages.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but repetitive structures appear: "Perhaps they'd think... Perhaps they'd weep... Perhaps they'd carry." Some metaphor strain in "forests where roots whispered forgiveness to fallen leaves" reduces clarity. The piece avoids loops but has moments of overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though some figurative density approaches overwriting ("like reunion shadowed by loss"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence appears in the "He [verb]" patterns mid-story but doesn't pervade. The closing sequence maintains momentum well despite complex imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of abstract language ("unyielding compassion" appears twice, "grace of tide-pulled kelp") and mild overwriting in the lagoon sequence ("harmonic waves, each crest a note, each trough a breath") prevent higher scoring. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with transformed imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong figurative control with purposeful imagery ("trapped auroras," "sidereal patience"). Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and concept simultaneously. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("liberation was not hers to claim") and slight register elevation in places.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though occasional density issues ("cathedral of gas and dust where petals of ionized plasma fell in slow, silent arcs across the quiet sigh of falling petals" repeats petal-falling). Some elevated diction borders on purple ("troubling serenity of success"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("wings brushing panes like parchment against stone") with good rhythm variation. However, abstract passages about grief's "geometry" and "angles of absence" create momentary opacity. Some filter verb clustering mid-story ("realized," "believed," "began") dulls propulsion, though the ending recovers momentum well.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythmic control and imagery density, though several instances of overwriting detract: "liquid night," "searing reverie," and extended metaphorical chains occasionally obscure rather than clarify. The prose achieves moments of excellence like "each step echoed not in stone but in bone" but sometimes prioritizes lyricism over clarity. Template phrases like "not merely...but" appear multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythmic variation and vivid imagery throughout, particularly in physical descriptions. Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. However, several abstract passages dilute momentum ("Intentions were not destinations, she realized, but gestures") and some metaphorical vehicles stretch coherence (the silo "trembled—not with quake, but with release"). The piece avoids major loops but occasionally paraphrases concepts rather than advancing them.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions, and the read-aloud test reveals varied rhythm. However, register drift appears in phrases like "groundedly imaginative constructs" and "probabilistic landscapes into human gesture" that clash with the otherwise lyric voice. Some conceptual redundancy exists between "coaxed not conquered" and similar restatements, though the pattern serves accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The glow guided her—not with light, but with heat, a secret beacon against the famine's chill"). Some figurative density in places ("mist curling at the threshold like a sigh") but serves the accumulative mode rather than obscuring.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around safety/fragments/absence that creates mild loops. "The mirage of safety" appears three times with similar framing. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("frozen screams," "bleeding light") without consistent payoff. The powder ritual section maintains better concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "He cataloged them in waterproof journals, cross-referenced by depth, material, and decay-rate." Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph rhythms. Minor deductions for occasional abstract philosophizing ("methodology incarnate") and some repetitive phrasing around "narrative" that borders on conceptual loop.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with lines doing multiple jobs ("vanished luthiers who once tuned wood to weep and sing"). Information unfolds through selective detail rather than exposition. Deducted for occasional overwriting ("the slow erosion of vanishing arts") and some template phrasing in reflection passages that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The vines weren't enemies—they were archives"). Some figurative density in peak moments edges toward overwriting ("stars stitched silver threads"), and occasional abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("letting synaptic plasticity rewire"). No major loops or scaffolding, but register occasionally drifts academic.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose achieves strong imagery ("hummingbees frozen mid-flight," "drinking lightning") but suffers from template cadence in middle passages ("She followed...At the third platform...But their abdomens"). Information density remains high, with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"reeds whispered secrets to the tide"—with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, overwrought figurative language appears too frequently ("butter-yellow glow," "pollen to the inside of her ribs"), and some phrases edge toward template mysticism. The closing suffers from slight redundancy in restating the sanctification mission.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "coral grew where hearts beat" achieve poetic compression. But repetitive structures appear: "Not collapse, but transformation. Not failure, but choice." The "cascading revelations" metaphor gets worked too explicitly. Some purple patches ("ribbons of luminescence spiraled upward") slow momentum without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance both external climbing and internal reckoning simultaneously. The prose achieves clarity through specific anchors (chipped die, 37 steps, neon arcade) while maintaining momentum through varied syntax that mirrors the endless ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in ritual descriptions that build world and character simultaneously. Some figurative density in early passages ("pooled like spilled ink," "confession booth for colors") without full payoff. Minor template cadence in middle exposition about the brush's history reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("bread shaped like initials—her grandmother's recipe, kneaded with lavender and grief"). Some metaphor density in early sections ("moss on its damp stone arches," "echoes remembered songs") and occasional register elevation ("mnemonic architecture") create minor friction without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("petals of obsidian unfolding") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears in lines like "He reached in. / His fingers closed around the gear. / Cold. / Alive." which feels artificially fragmented. Some metaphors strain credibility ("fate's cruel arithmetic," "time's underbelly"). Information density is high but clarity occasionally suffers from elevated diction that obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rich figurative language mostly serves pressure ("pixels" of dissolving fear, "photographically cursed" memories). Some density issues with stacked metaphors in places. Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor loops in the fear description sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The black sea softened, lightened, became translucent again, humming with afterglow" tracks transformation while maintaining sonic focus. Some figurative density in peak beats ("fractal generating spirals... recursive and urgent") but serves the pattern. Minor template cadence in "The Prophet smiled... Kael stared... The orchard sighed" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The whistle's melody wasn't music—it was a pattern language." Minor metaphor strain in "spirals that collapsed inward like failed lungs" and occasional elevated diction ("electric certainty") that slightly exceeds the established register.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("roots cracking through concrete like veins of forgotten time") but several abstract runs weaken momentum. The metaphor "truth is a lantern in a hurricane" works well, but phrases like "convenient myth" and "curated silence" feel slightly templated. Information density varies—strong in descriptive passages, thinner in some reflective sections. No major artifacts but could tighten conceptual repetition in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("drawbridge rose with groan of rust and resolve"). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("interlaced absence," "layered silence") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density, though it serves the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Truth, she knew, rarely roared—it seeped"). However, several abstract formulations ("To give the silenced a syntax," "purpose luminous") and some template-like parallel constructions in the middle section. Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting with stacked modifiers.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "gravity wept and time curled like steam from a teacup." Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("luminous torment—a glow that warmed nothing"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and slight register drift in peak moments ("satiation," "translucent"). The clarity at closure remains strong despite these minor frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong images ("wound turning in its sleep"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("unused potential pools"), some filter verbs ("She felt exhilarated"), and slight overwriting in metaphorical density that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the discovery sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, several template patterns appear: "She [verb]" constructions cluster in paragraphs 8-10, and abstract phrasing like "fragments of self she'd shed" dulls immediacy. The "brilliant dimness" paradox works but similar constructions accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and purposeful rhythm, though some metaphorical density in peak beats ("tiles cool beneath bare feet" followed immediately by "stretched like a bruise"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deduction for repetitive "She [verb]" openings in the final third and slight overwriting in places ("gnawed at driftwood carvings half-buried in salt and sand").

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence: "peace is never signed in ink but carved in silence." Information density generally high. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("lead of loss into something that could bear weight") and some abstract phrasing that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Deductions for repetitive "She [verb]" structures in several passages and some overwriting in metaphorical density ("merrily melancholic," "pilgrim," "barnacles shaken loose"). Information density high but occasionally tips into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"the water glowing faintly turquoise like forgotten neon" establishes setting while evoking loss. Some metaphor density in peak moments ("ghostly relief against the cavern's ribs") occasionally tips toward overwriting. Information flows cleanly with strong propulsion through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good information density. However, some overwriting appears in figurative language ("smoke serpents," "crackling parchment and distant chimes") and occasional template structures ("not fully phoenix, not fully woman"). The closing sequence has some paraphrase loops ("The end was never the point. The bond was.") that slightly diminish impact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, but figurative language appears too frequently in peak beats without clear payoff ("spectral hands," "roots rose like veins"). Some register drift into elevated diction ("archive of evaporated seconds") that doesn't fully match the intimate POV. The prose maintains momentum despite occasional overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("tears...refracted not memory but possibility—the coordinates of locked dimensions"), though occasional overwriting appears ("meadow under twin moons, populated by translucent figures"). The figurative language occasionally strains ("kelp in zero-G tide") but momentum sustains through varied rhythm and purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good momentum. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some figurative density in places ("bent time like taffy," "mist that curled around her ankles like loyal cats") that occasionally feels stacked. A few instances of slight redundancy ("whispering hush—a vibrant hush") but overall propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("winking hush," "cradle of sparks") without becoming overwrought. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She knelt... She pressed... She folded...") deducts from otherwise strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"silver-throated, bioluminescent kind that slipped through rock like ghosts" establishes eel properties while advancing mystical tone. Some elevated diction ("sacred syntax," "resonant reconfiguration") occasionally drifts from the herder's established register but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers, but abstract passages like "to rarefy was to refine pain until it gleamed" create paraphrase loops that explain rather than dramatize. Template structures appear ("She had not come to chart stars, but scars") alongside some overwrought metaphors, though the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied syntax. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("prismatic shards...silent herald") and occasional template phrasing ("She smiled—not in victory, but in partnership"). The mechanical/organic imagery effectively mirrors the protagonist's nature but occasionally strains.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments like "words stuck like burrs in her coat lining" and varied sentence structures, though some passages accumulate figurative language densely ("moonlight stitching the fractures"). Minor template cadence appears in the seed-planting sequence but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The horizon didn't just invite night—it shattered into dawn"). Some metaphorical density in early passages ("mist that curled like forgotten melodies") and occasional abstract phrasing ("strategically creative") create minor drag. The final sequence from "She lifted her hands" through the ending is exemplary in rhythm and control.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in world-building passages. However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("luminous and sharp," "empirically whimsical") and occasional abstract phrasing ("memory's quiet insistence") create mild opacity. The ending achieves propulsion despite heavy modification, and no significant loops or scaffolding appear.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("brass tarnished by centuries of spectral salt"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths. Minor deduction for occasional elevated diction ("liturgical stole") that slightly exceeds necessity, but no loops or scaffolding.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts. Rhythm is masterful, varying naturally with the scene's needs. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("like tides adjusting to a receding moon"). Every sentence advances character and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, though a single instance of slightly stacked modification ("drifting resonance of memory and land entwined") momentarily slows momentum. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.5)
    Exceptional line-level control with high information density and zero artifacts. Syntax and rhythm are masterful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. Figurative language ("laughter, fossilized in frost") is precise, coherent, and deeply integrated, never muddying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and vivid, precise imagery ("prisms fractured like frozen lightning"). Sentence-level rhythm and syntax are expertly controlled to modulate with the scene's needs. There is a minor tendency toward dense metaphor clusters in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a tidal pull of unfinished business"), which creates a slight drag on momentum but does not obscure clarity or harm the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("amplified quiet"). A single minor rhythm stumble in the phrase "gentle, persistent, untraceable" creates a slight list-like effect, but it does not harm closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. Sentence-level rhythm is masterful and varies naturally with scene needs. A minor instance of potential scaffold exists ("Petals became faces. Archways became arms.") but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. The prose is largely pristine, though a minor instance of potential register drift occurs with the phrase "retrocognitively trapped," which feels slightly clinical amidst the otherwise lush, embodied diction. Momentum is never lost.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lush, precise, and highly evocative, with excellent rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. A minor, hairline deduction for a moment of potential density ("danced like pollen") in a high-pressure beat, though it is pattern-taught and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting appears in peak beats—e.g., "the sigh of surrender when love chooses to let go" slightly explains the exquisite "brittle snap of a vow." This creates a hairline figurative muddle, preventing a 9+ score. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are superb, with zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exquisitely crafted with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("shadows pooled like spilled ink") is consistently vivid and coherent. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "luminous disbelief," which feels slightly outside the thief's lexicon, but it is a single, isolated moment in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and taught ("ice whispered its retreat"). Sentence-level propulsion varies perfectly with the ritual's cadence. Read-aloud rhythm is masterful. A single minor loop: "thaw" appears frequently, but the pattern is taught and paid off thematically.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "forged in betrayal, baptized in trembling certainty" risks synonym churn) prevents a higher score, though clarity is never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats, e.g., "its brittle pages whispering against her palms like moth wings brushing glass," though the pattern is taught and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; every sentence advances atmosphere and character.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and poetic precision. A minor register drift occurs with "bruised twilight," which feels slightly elevated for the POV, but this is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a risk of overwriting in the description of the doodles, but the pattern is taught and purposeful, serving the accumulative design. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle in the peak closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.8)
    Prose is exceptionally concise and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere; there is zero scaffolding or looped phrasing. Figurative language is precise, pattern-taught, and pays off, such as the wrist-band "dangling like a shed snakeskin." The final image is clear and potent, undulled by any artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("pulsing like a dormant heart," "like layers of an onion") is purposeful and consistent, enhancing clarity rather than obscuring it. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift detract from the closure's power.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally controlled and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion that mirrors the unseen symphony. Figurative language ("music stands leaned like broken reeds") is purposeful and consistent. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. A single minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on the visual sense in early paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the "auroral sorrow" personification slightly strains clarity in an otherwise flawless peak beat. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact exists: the phrase "drowsy alertness" is used twice in close proximity, creating a slight echo that slightly dulls the specificity of the opening line. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure but prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a slight density in the middle ("Forests grew teeth...") creates a minor, momentary drag on momentum. No loops, scaffold, or muddle. Read-aloud quality is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety that accelerates and breathes with scene needs. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("slow tides," "velvet pause"). Zero loops, scaffold, or artifice. Closure image is crystal clear.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and enhances clarity ("glow pooled like liquid metal"). No artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, accelerating with discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.6)

    Prose is dense, precise, and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent and legible, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity ("orbits of regret," "bureaucratic fog"). Sentence-level rhythm expertly modulates to match the protagonist's focused intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat with the parallel clauses "Static dissolved into sighs. Screams unraveled into yawns," which creates a slight template cadence and softens the impact of the closure moment. This prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and sensory density. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "the soft, lavender-tinted discomfort of standing at the edge of revelation"), which momentarily risks clarity. However, the propulsion never stalls, and the closure image is crystal clear.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is superb, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative density artifact appears in the peak beat: "mercy without consequence was theater; aberrant mercy bled, and in bleeding, bound." The stacked metaphors, while thematically resonant, create a slight muddle in an otherwise crystalline moment, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor figurative overloading occurs in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "like a half-remembered aria caught in twilight" followed closely by another metaphor), slightly obscuring immediacy but not causality. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the clarity of the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without artifacts. Figurative language like "frozen lightning" and "willowglass hope" is pattern-taught and pays off. No loops, scaffold, or synonym churn. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with somatic cues.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical yet maintains clarity and propulsion, with every sentence advancing story or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise and pattern-taught, avoiding muddle. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful. A minor deduction for a potential register elevation in "pure affect," though it is largely voice-motivated and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.7)
    Exemplary line-level craft with high information density, zero loops or scaffold, and masterful figurative language that never muddles sense. The prose accelerates and breathes in perfect step with the scene’s needs, and the final sentences are flawlessly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic variation. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats ("scattered pages of an unread book" feels slightly decorative). However, clarity and momentum are never obscured, and the closure image is piercingly clear.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor artifact: the phrase "spindrift serenity" risks register drift in the final paragraph, slightly softening the closure's impact. Otherwise, every sentence advances story and atmosphere without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. Sentences often do multiple jobs, advancing character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously ("Time here was not linear but layered — a palimpsest of summers stacked like honeycomb"). Rhythm varies naturally, breathing with the scene's needs. A minor instance of potentially decorative phrasing ("liquid regret") is outweighed by overwhelming precision and purpose. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "luminous, trembling, temporary" in the final third has a slight list-like quality. However, this does not obscure closure or causality, and the sentence-level propulsion remains flawless throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "atomically reflective skin flaring cobalt with ancestral recognition" advances character, theme, and action). Minor deduction for slight density in peak beats: phrases like "translating isolation into independence not by forgetting, but by reshaping solitude into sovereignty" approach thematic statement but are anchored in character voice. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward abstraction in phrases like "keeper of secrets too tender for daylight" and "pulse of the thread," which momentarily soften the concrete vividness. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally strong with high information density and clear propulsion, though a minor artifact exists: the slightly repetitive phrasing of "cosmic tricksters" (though it functions as a necessary term of art). The final paragraph's rhythm is perfectly controlled to land the Charged Poise with immense power. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddles.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and vivid, concrete imagery ("dust motes that danced like forgotten spirits"). Rhythm is purposeful and varies effectively. One minor artifact: "It transfix her instantly" should be "transfixed." This is a small, isolated grammatical slip.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("mist coiling around her ankles like guilt made visible") is purposeful and powerful, not ornamental. A single, minor instance of potential scaffold exists ("beauty and brutality, celebration and silence, mask and void"), but it is brief, pattern-taught, and pays off, causing no momentum loss or clarity issue.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of overwriting occurs in the climax with the short, declarative sentences ("It was memory. It was grief."), which slightly disrupt the established lyrical flow under peak pressure, though clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety. A minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "pixelated amnesty" itself is a complex metaphor), though it remains coherent and serves the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Minor overwriting in a few phrases ("strangely sacred," "polished calm like a lens") creates slight figurative muddle, but clarity is never harmed.

Not with violence, but with grace." Read-aloud rhythm is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly deliberate, with excellent rhythmic control. Minor artifacting occurs in a few adjacent, metaphor-rich sentences (e.g., "like old bones welcoming rain" followed by "liquid moonlight pooled like mercury"), creating a slight density overload that momentarily stalls momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.7)
    Exquisite line-level control. Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with every sentence advancing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "silence was not absence but presence—an entity that curled around ankles") which, while beautiful, momentarily slows the meticulous momentum of the infusion ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle. Minor deduction for the slightly repetitive use of "vineyard hush," a near-duplicate that slightly dulls the final image's uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly crafted with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythm. Minor scaffold appears in phrases like "lacks spark" and "resists protocol," and a slight register drift occurs in the description of the glyph-engines, momentarily distancing from Lior's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("cerulean streaked with amber"). A single minor abstraction ("signifying") in the final line is the only hairline slip, but it is earned by the prior concretes and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in a high-pressure beat ("like a dying pulsar," "like sugar in hot tea," "like fallen stars") which, while beautiful, momentarily risks pattern overload before clarity is restored.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.0)
    Exquisite line-level craft with high information density and purposeful, vivid sensory detail. The prose is propulsive and largely free of artifacts, though a very slight rhythmical stumble occurs in the paragraph beginning "I began to note patterns," which prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor line-level artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats ("spectral tears") and a paraphrase loop near the end ("beautiful and terrifying" / "silent, spectral, strangely trustworthy"). These do not, however, obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose is flawless, achieving high information density and rhythmic propulsion without a single artifact.

    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and virtually flawless. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("owls called in binary hoots"). A single, hairline instance of potential register drift ("synaptic terrain") prevents a perfect score, but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Most sentences advance multiple goals. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for the "synaptic thread glowing" line, which is a slightly mixed metaphor that dulls clarity in a key beat.

Sentence-level propulsion is exquisite, accelerating toward the climax and breathing into the resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor pattern of stacked modifiers and complex syntax creates occasional density that slightly obscures immediacy in peak beats (e.g., "the elegant tension between attraction and repulsion, the hidden symmetry in chaos"). No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor tendency toward ornate description ("velvet cobwebs," "petrified silence") flirts with overwriting in the opening, though it remains purposeful and never obscures causality.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat: "swirling around her ankles like silk scarves woven from silence and starlight" slightly strains the established physical logic of the hush. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion with zero loops or scaffold.

Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence-level craft supports the accumulative drive without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, but this density is purposeful and pattern-taught, serving the accumulative drive. There is a minor risk of figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "whispered equation," "lucid turbulence"), but clarity is never broken and the closure image lands with power. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. A minor deduction for occasional overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "wisdom often blooms brightest in the compost of error" edges toward pseudo-profundity), but the closure image remains unclouded and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly lyrical with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduct for occasional over-written phrases ("the grammar of absolution") that slightly elevate diction beyond the POV's likely lexicon in peak beats, creating a minor register drift without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose is flawless, with high information density and zero artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and legible, enhancing clarity and momentum rather than obscuring it. Rhythm varies purposefully with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Figurative language is generally purposeful but occasionally dense in peak beats (e.g., "ligatures of longing, marginalia of memory" risks slight overload). No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Minor deduction for two instances of near-redundant phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exquisite, with high information density, rhythmic control, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is coherent, purposeful, and heightens pressure without obscuring clarity. A very minor tendency toward similar sentence lengths in a few passages prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Sentences are propulsive and multi-tasking ("Its joints creaked with the memory of a child’s laughter, now decades dust"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles, even in the high-pressure climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere simultaneously. There is a single, minor artifact: the phrase "emotional resonance" is a slight register drift into therapeutic lexicon that feels mildly out of step with the otherwise concrete, embodied voice. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly polished, with virtually no scaffold or loops. Minor deductions for occasional over-stacked metaphors ("static hymns," "tide-bound ghost") that, while beautiful, slightly risk clarity in the opening beats. However, the line-level propulsion is impeccable, and the closure is crystal clear.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for potential overwriting in high-pressure beats, such as "ribs arching like cathedral buttresses against the bruised horizon," which, while beautiful, slightly risks pattern density without immediate payoff. However, no loops or artifacts obscure closure, and the final paragraphs are flawlessly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and purposeful, varied syntax. A very minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in the opening paragraph ("parchment older than the trees," "weight of unsaid futures"), though it quickly coheres into the story's taught pattern and does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly crafted with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for slight density in the opening paragraph ("dead as in retired, forgotten") and a near-paraphrase loop ("whispered warnings or welcomed rain"/"syntax in their mortar, grammar in their gables"). However, these do not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly coherent (e.g., "petals that sighed like forgotten lullabies," "memories were tragically radiant... with the brilliance of supernovas collapsing").

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Most sentences advance multiple jobs of character, atmosphere, and plot. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "stalactites drip" is repeated four times, creating a slight template cadence. However, this repetition also functions as a purposeful rhythmic motif, teaching a pattern that pays off in the accelerated dripping during the climax, mitigating the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, without muddle. A single minor artifact: the phrase "reed-blown melancholy" is a slightly overt thematic label in an otherwise shown narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, enhancing clarity rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density. A minor deduction for a cluster of dense figurative language in the opening paragraph ("stormlit observatory above clouds," "frost-glazed metal grates," "thunder growled like a caged beast") which, while beautiful, slightly risks ornamentation in a high-pressure beat. Momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without a single muddled metaphor or loop, achieving high information density and rhythmic control.

The final lines demonstrate perfect syntactic variety and propulsion toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for density: the high concentration of figurative language in peak beats, while often effective, occasionally risks slight over-writing (e.g., "gentle as a mother’s lullaby, fierce as a glacier’s birth"). However, it never obscures causality or closure, and the sentence-level propulsion remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and controlled, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, avoiding muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly inventive ("a bell no one hears yet"). A single minor artifact: the phrase "with the devotion of a mechanic..." is a slightly self-conscious summary that briefly pauses momentum. Otherwise, line-level craft is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptional, with high information density and zero artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere.

    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density, rhythmic control, and zero artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and never muddled, even in peak beats ("the universe remembered how to breathe"). Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or story. A hairline deduction for minor alliterative excess ("luminous with ache, let it").

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional. The prose is dense, lyrical, and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("like honey on warm toast, like salt on a lover’s skin") is precise, purposeful, and consistently legible, even in peak beats. The read-aloud rhythm is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, minor artifacting occurs, including a tendency toward synonym churn ("unraveled," "excised," "sealed") and a few stacked modifiers in peak beats ("quietly deliberate even as the world unraveled"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density ("a nostalgic innovation, as if time itself had been gently rewired"). Rhythm varies naturally and supports the accumulative drive. A minor instance of elevated diction ("nostalgic innovation") is voice-motivated and does not clash. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs.

No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues; every sentence advances the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional figurative overcrowding in high-pressure beats (e.g., "rain that tasted of ink and salt" following a dense sequence of metaphors), which slightly mutes the clarity of individual images. However, the pattern is taught and overall propulsion is maintained, with no loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly polished, with excellent rhythm and sensory density. However, a minor tendency toward overwriting is detected in a few high-pressure beats with stacked metaphors (e.g., "whispers folded between ticks," "silence wasn’t absence, but presence thick as velvet"). While beautiful, this slightly risks blurring sense and creates a detectable pattern, preventing a higher score despite otherwise exceptional craft.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional overwriting, such as "serene upheaval" feeling slightly didactic and the stacked modifiers in "thoughtfully clear, his instincts humming like tuned strings" nearing ornamentation.

    Prose is exceptional, with high information density, zero loops or scaffold, and masterful figurative language that consistently advances sense and atmosphere. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. Read-aloud quality is superb. No figurative muddle in peak beats; every image is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exquisite, with high information density, rhythmic control, and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("like honey laced with salt, like reunion shadowed by loss") creates a slight risk of overloading the reader's sensorium, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves closure ("grace of tide-pulled kelp" → "wrapping her in... kelp-drift peace"). A single, minor artifact: "Firefighter by trade, arsonist’s daughter by blood" has a slight template cadence, but it's purposeful and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic variety. However, a minor artifact exists: a slight over-reliance on complex figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like static to wool," "like trapped auroras") creates a subtle drag on momentum, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic variation. However, slight overwriting occurs in peak beats, such as "the troubling serenity of success," where abstract phrasing momentarily dulls immediacy. Figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful, but this minor lapse prevents a higher score. No loops or scaffolding artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor overwriting in phrases like "vibrating with quiet intensity" is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

There are zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; every sentence advances character and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a very minor tendency toward decorative phrasing (e.g., "velveteen gloom") that slightly inflates texture without advancing sense, preventing a perfect score. However, every sentence advances the story, and there are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddles in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight risk of overwriting in the peak beat ("pregnant... fertile"), which momentarily verges on abstraction. However, the clarity and propulsion never falter, and the closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and zero scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("thistled calm") is inventive, consistent, and serves the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is superb, with high information density and rhythmic control. The read-aloud test passes flawlessly. A minor deduction for a potential instance of density in the line "their art now archived, unplayed, untaught, another casualty in the slow erosion of vanishing arts," where the stacked modifiers slightly risk abstraction. However, this is a hairline slip that does not obscure clarity or momentum. The final paragraph is a masterclass in concise, resonant propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical yet maintains propulsion, with high information density and figurative language that is consistent and purposeful ("leaves unfolding like scrolls").

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise ("crystallized nectar," "harmonic resonance"). A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the opening paragraph ("like sap," "skeletal spire") which, while beautiful, creates a small density bump before the cleaner, more propulsive prose that follows. No artifacts harm clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. One minor figurative strain exists: "silence pooled like spilled ink" slightly muddles auditory and visual senses, but this is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, marked by a confident rhythm and high information density where every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and theme. Line-level craft is exceptional, balancing poetic language with clarity and propulsion. A minor redundancy exists in the reuse of "thoughtfully spirited," but this is a tiny flaw in an otherwise impeccably polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is muscular and evocative, with strong verbs and varied syntax. However, the high density of figurative language—while consistent with the voice—borders on overwriting, particularly in moments of high tension. This relentless layering of metaphor and simile can occasionally blunt the immediacy of the action rather than sharpening it, showing a minor lack of restraint in an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, a style that carries high risk but is executed with precision and clarity. While verging on overwriting, the figurative language consistently serves to build the specific, strange reality of the scene rather than merely decorate it. Sentence structure is varied, propulsion is excellent, and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding; every line contributes to the story's textural density and forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates high information density. However, a few phrases like "ambiguously clear clarity" or the explanation that the lens absorbs "the collective release of withheld truths" momentarily lapse into telling. While minor, these slips slightly mar an otherwise impeccable line-level execution by over-explaining the story's magic.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with figurative language that consistently serves the story's theme and atmosphere. Every sentence feels crafted, creating a distinct rhythm that mirrors the protagonist’s deliberate, ritualistic actions.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is outstanding: dense, lyrical, and precise without a single wasted word or overwrought image.

It passes the read-aloud test with ease, its syntax and cadence modulating perfectly with the rising tension and final, quiet resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is the story's greatest asset: dense, rhythmic, and highly figurative without becoming obscure.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and confident, marked by striking and original metaphors like "silence grew teeth" and "ash still clung like regret."

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and a memorable, rhythmic cadence. Sentences like “his subconscious knew the island’s secrets before he did” and “the cryptic was merely familiar enigma dressed in paper” are both elegant and functional. There are no discernible loops or scaffolding; every line contributes to the story's momentum and atmospheric density.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and largely successful, characterized by high information density and potent, inventive metaphors ("cassock, stitched from frayed audio tape," "paradoxes that bloom like wounds"). While the prose is exceptionally strong, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally verges on being overwrought, though it never quite breaks coherence or momentum. It's a performance of immense skill that avoids any significant loops or artifacts, but a touch more restraint would have perfected it.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, striking imagery, and rhythmic precision. Figurative language ("last stars like trapped breath," "a seam...stitched between what was and what might still sing") is both original and purposeful, enhancing meaning without becoming ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are moments where the conceptual language becomes slightly too dense and abstract, bordering on academic register ("procedural generation," "algorithmically derived"). While this largely fits the story's speculative nature, it occasionally reads more like an explanation of the premise than an embodied experience, slightly slowing the momentum in those specific lines.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and striking, purposeful imagery ("melodies inverted into question marks, harmonies dissolving like sugar in cold tea").

The language is sophisticated without ever breaking from the established tone or POV.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, precise, and highly effective, with strong momentum and information density. However, a few phrases like "credibly curious rather than paranoid" and "layered tranquility" have a slightly writerly finish that feels more like authorial summary than the character's immediate perception. Similarly, the line "Solitude had nurtured his integrity; now, movement would weaponize it," while thematically resonant, functions as an explicit statement that slightly lessens the power of what has just been shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is central to the story's effect. However, a few phrases like "avalanche of memory" and "sorrow’s weight" lean on familiar constructions. The primary flaw is a very high density of figurative language in peak moments, which, while beautiful, occasionally verges on overwriting and slightly slows the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is meticulously crafted, with a confident rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is strong and purposeful, such as the rope's story seeping "into her palms like tea into bone."

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and precise, evocative language. Figurative language is consistently inventive and world-appropriate ("peeling instants like petals from frozen blossoms," "vibrations curled like embryos").

The read-aloud test reveals a varied, compelling rhythm throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptional: dense, rhythmic, and precise. Figurative language is both original and purposeful, as in "droplets from stalactites struck mossy earth like metronomes counting down to nothing." There is zero scaffolding or redundancy; every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, and the central conceptual inquiry with a rare combination of intellectual rigor and emotional depth. The line-level craft is nearly flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful, such as the brooch “glowing like a trapped sunset” or shutters rattling “like teeth.” There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every sentence serves to advance atmosphere, character, or knowledge. The final paragraph demonstrates exceptional control of cadence, bringing the story to a close with both finality and a sense of continuation.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in most lines. Figurative language is fresh and effective ("like ink spilled in water, then pulled back into impossible shapes"). A minor flaw appears in the final paragraph, where the line "And the clairvoyant—who didn’t see it coming—finally understood:" acts as scaffolding for the thematic summary, a slight dip in craft at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, syntactic variety, and precisely chosen language. Figurative language, like "mapping grief into geography," is both beautiful and functional, advancing the story’s core concept. The prose is exceptionally clean, with no evidence of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, resulting in a momentum that is both deliberate and compelling.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and dense with powerful, evocative imagery. The sentence-level craft is superb, creating a propulsive yet dreamlike momentum. There is a very minor register drift with phrases like "emotional triangulation," which feel slightly more academic than the surrounding lyrical prose. The main flaw, the thematic summary at the end, reads more like a thematic misstep (scored in Q5) than a line-level failure, but it does create a slight drag on the final paragraph's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Word choice is precise and sensory ("calloused," "brittle," "silvered"), while sentence structure varies to create a compelling rhythm that carries the reader effortlessly. There are no discernible loops or prose artifacts; every line serves to deepen the atmosphere or advance Elira's internal journey. The clarity and elegance of the language are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, but its relentless density of figurative language occasionally tips into overwriting. Lines like "whips of ionized regret" or "gravity apologized and stepped aside" are stylistically overwrought, momentarily distracting from an otherwise controlled and powerful tone. More restraint would allow the truly exceptional images to land with greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, confident, and often lyrical, with phrases like "the viscosity of human distraction" and "deathly vitality" demonstrating a high level of craft. The momentum is excellent, driven by clean, purposeful sentences. The score is held just below the 9+ band by a few sentences in the final section that slip into thematic summary, slightly restating what the preceding actions have already powerfully demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense with figurative language but remains clear and purposeful, with each sentence contributing to the story's unique atmosphere. The rhythm is controlled, accelerating with the character's discovery and settling into a quiet cadence at the end. While verging on maximalist, the style is a deliberate and effective choice that avoids overwritten clichés, instead building a world through its rich, specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.9)
    The line-level craft is immaculate, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality. Sentences are dense with meaning and rhythmically controlled, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, avoiding overwriting by being deeply integrated into the story's voice and core conceits. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the craft is clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently beautiful, with high information density and striking figurative language. However, a few moments verge on overwriting, where the prose summarizes the emotional state or theme directly (e.g., "Hopeful desperation fuels her nights..."). While minor, these instances momentarily substitute telling for the otherwise powerful showing, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and lyrical, with nearly every sentence serving multiple functions. Word choice is precise and evocative, avoiding overwriting while creating vivid imagery. The rhythm is expertly controlled, slowing for reflection and holding its breath at the climax. There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding; the craft is seamless and propels the quiet narrative with understated grace.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and rhythmic, with high information density and vivid, original imagery. The sentences propel the narrative forward with a calm, deliberate momentum that matches the protagonist's actions. The craft is nearly flawless until the final two sentences, which are abstract summaries that break the "show, don't tell" principle and slightly flatten the powerful closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly lyrical, achieving a nearly flawless execution. The sentences are rhythmically varied and packed with information and atmosphere. While the high density of figurative language ("compass disguised as grammar," "bookmark in the fabric of reality") borders on overwriting, it remains consistent with the character's intellectual and myth-infused worldview. The piece is remarkably clean of scaffolding or redundant phrasing, showcasing immense line-level control.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is nearly flawless. Word choice is precise and evocative, sentence structures are varied and rhythmic, and the density of meaning in each line is exceptionally high. The piece is highly polished, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or overwriting; every word serves the story's momentum and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exquisite and demonstrates superb rhythmic control and information density. The high concentration of figurative language is a bold stylistic choice that largely succeeds in creating a dreamlike, intense atmosphere. A minor deduction is warranted for a slightly mechanical repetition of the phrase "touches memories," which briefly breaks the otherwise seamless flow.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality, marked by its rhythmic precision, information density, and evocative figurative language. Sentences like "Wind gnawed at the jagged reef below" and "the wood groaning like a throat that hadn’t spoken since the ’37 storm" are both beautiful and functional. The piece avoids clutter and scaffolding, maintaining momentum and clarity even with its elevated style. A rare instance of grammatical variance ("it hover") reads as a deliberate, effective choice.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense with powerful imagery and rhythmic control, especially in the staccato sentences of the climax ("Glass panes hummed. Stems straightened."). While generally superb, the prose occasionally tips into overwriting with its sheer density of figurative language, and a minor paraphrase loop occurs in the explanation of the curse ("devotion twisted into obligation...love so potent it curdled into duty"). These are minor issues in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density and exquisite figurative language. The prose propels the narrative through its rhythmic and syntactic control. The score is held back slightly by the final paragraph, which contains a few phrases ("hold the map to their own becoming," "proof that reverence grows best...") that feel more like thematic assertions than the sharp, concrete imagery that characterizes the rest of the piece, introducing a minor register shift at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic, with high information density in its best moments ("gnarled roots threading between femurs and skulls like fingers reclaiming forgotten prayers"). However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly slowing momentum. The final paragraph, while thematically resonant, contains a few abstract phrases ("time itself learned to bloom again") that feel less sharp than the concrete imagery preceding them.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and exceptionally crafted. Word choice is precise and evocative, and the syntax varies to create a compelling rhythm that mirrors the story's deliberate pace. Figurative language is fresh and integrated seamlessly, as in "brass mail chutes polished to nostalgia." There are no prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or theme with remarkable economy.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished to a mirror shine. The highly metaphorical style is a deliberate and successful choice that defines the story's reality rather than merely describing it. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied with musical precision, accelerating during the crisis and settling into a quiet, steady cadence at the close. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; the information density is remarkable.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both precision and evocative power. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as wax cracking "like frozen regret" and the shard pulsing "like a heartbeat restarting." There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought passages; every sentence propels the narrative forward while simultaneously deepening atmosphere and character.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs employ a repetitive syntactic structure (“not X, but Y”; “Let it… Let it…”) that feels slightly mechanical and overly explanatory. This template cadence in the crucial final moments slightly flattens the landing, replacing the earlier organic flow with a more structured summary and creating a prose artifact that affects the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, with high information density and exquisite figurative language that feels integral, not decorative. Phrases like "reading braille left by forgotten hands" and "tapestries from fog-thread" are both evocative and efficient. The extended metaphor comparing the light projection to exposed film is a moment of conceptual brilliance that provides a satisfying logic to the story's central magic. The line-level craft is nearly flawless, with varied sentence structures that propel the narrative forward beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is simply flawless—dense with meaning, rhythmically sophisticated, and stunningly original in its figurative language (e.g., “grief made basslines brittle, joy turned treble to dust”). Every sentence serves a purpose, advancing character, atmosphere, or plot with remarkable economy. The synesthetic descriptions during the climax are handled with a control that makes an impossible experience feel viscerally real.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense and evocative without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Line-level craft is superb, with high information density and rhythmic syntax ("its hollow rattle a metronome for rebellion, a vessel for the secret language club’s last unrecorded dialect"). While the language is highly stylized, it remains consistent with the "rogue scholar" voice and avoids overwriting, instead building a cohesive and immersive textual world. There are no wasted words or technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and precise. Every sentence works to advance atmosphere and character. While rich with figurative language, it avoids overwriting by ensuring each image serves a clear purpose, such as "nebulae swirling as cherry petals caught mid-fall." There are no loops, scaffolding, or clutter; the information density is high, and the rhythm is impeccably controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and dense with precisely chosen imagery, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Figurative language, such as "grief bound in vellum, joy pressed between glass," is not ornamental but serves to build the world and theme with remarkable economy.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with sentences that consistently perform multiple functions. Figurative language, such as "Reknitting the social fabric with syntax and song," is both beautiful and precise. While the register is consistently elevated, it avoids feeling overwritten by staying true to the character's voice and the story's specific, intellectual world, resulting in a piece with exceptional line-level craft and zero technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and dense with imagery, demonstrating high-level craft. Sentences are intricately constructed, and word choice is precise and evocative. The only hesitation for a higher score is the sheer density of figurative language; while it supports the accumulative mode, a few moments verge on feeling overwritten, slightly impeding momentum rather than accelerating it. However, there are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet it maintains clarity and propulsion, a difficult balance to strike. While verging on overwriting, the elevated style feels integral to the story's magical realist tone rather than being merely decorative. There are no loops or redundancies; every line works to build atmosphere or advance the delicate plot, culminating in a final paragraph that is both clean and emotionally resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is consistently stellar, with high information density and a varied, compelling rhythm. Figurative language is inventive and purposeful, creating vivid, memorable images. The only slight hesitation is the sheer density of the lyricism, which occasionally borders on being overwritten but always pulls back to serve the story's momentum and clarity, especially in the powerful, focused final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and often brilliant, with high information density and evocative figurative language. However, a significant flaw occurs at the climax: "...in that shared exhale, spotting the first fireflies of summer, she captivated not them, but herself." The phrase "spotting the first fireflies of summer" is a jarring, logic-breaking artifact in a deep-sea setting, momentarily shattering the story's carefully constructed world and reading as an unintegrated external constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating exceptional command of rhythm, syntax, and figurative language without becoming overwrought. Information density is high, with nearly every sentence serving character, atmosphere, and momentum. The only minor flaw is the slight shift toward a more declarative, explanatory register in the final paragraph, which momentarily breaks from the otherwise consistently "shown" narrative style.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and varied sentence structure creating a compelling rhythm. Figurative language is strong and purposeful. A minor penalty is applied for a few instances of scaffolding, particularly the sentence beginning "Everything happened...", which summarizes the core concept rather than letting the action carry the meaning alone.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, elegant, and almost entirely flawless. Every sentence serves to advance atmosphere, character, or theme, achieving remarkable information density without feeling cluttered. While the figurative language is exceptionally rich and constant, it remains coherent and serves the story's mythic tone, managing to stay just on the right side of overwriting through its consistency and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, lyrical precision, and rhythmic control. Phrasing like "fracturing dawn’s gold into spectral shards" is both beautiful and functional. The prose is elevated without ever feeling overwritten, maintaining its integrity even at peak moments of reflection. There are no loops, scaffolding, or other artifacts; every sentence serves a clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and information-dense, with striking figurative language ("ember-kisses," "alchemy of ache"). The line-level craft is superb, with varied sentence structures and strong momentum. The only slight weakness is a tendency toward aphoristic summary ("He didn’t need resolution. He needed resonance"), which, while fitting the reflective voice, occasionally tells the emotional state rather than letting the concrete action carry its full weight. This is a minor issue of stylistic balance rather than a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and a controlled, evocative rhythm. The prose is precise and often beautiful. A minor deduction is warranted for a faint paraphrase loop ("Her lucidly watchful gaze... Her lucid watchfulness...") and a tendency towards dense clusters of conceptual metaphors that, while tonally consistent, occasionally border on abstraction over embodiment. These are hairline faults in an otherwise masterfully polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating exceptional control of rhythm, syntax, and imagery. Information density is high, with every sentence serving multiple functions of character, atmosphere, and theme. Figurative language is fresh and precise ("curled like unborn birds," "moonlight, sharp as a scalpel") and entirely free of overwriting or cliché. There are no prose artifacts; the piece is polished to a flawless finish.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and rhythmic, successfully navigating the risk of overwriting to achieve a powerful atmospheric effect. Sentence structure is varied for momentum, and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding. A minor deduction is for the sheer density of figurative language, which, while beautiful and coherent, occasionally prioritizes texture over the sharpest possible propulsion in a few lines.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft with no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language, such as the clipboard as "both shield and scripture," is precise and powerful. While the diction is elevated ("iridescent ink, brewed from crushed meteorite and midnight orchid"), it establishes a coherent mythic tone that serves the story's ambition without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control on every line.

There are no loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles; the language is clean, propulsive, and serves the story's tone and momentum with flawless integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is superb, with high information density and rhythmic, varied syntax. The prose is thick with figurative language, a stylistic choice that largely succeeds due to its consistency and quality. A single, slightly jarring simile ("dissolved like sugar in tea") creates a minor register shift against the otherwise mythic language, a hairline flaw in an otherwise immaculate piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and frequently stunning, marked by high information density and rhythmic control. However, it occasionally tips into being slightly overwritten or too thematically explicit, as with the phrase “violence as punctuation, not interruption,” which reads more like an authorial thesis than an organic character thought. Similarly, "meteor hush" feels a bit strained. These are minor imperfections in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece, but they prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and demonstrates a high level of craft, with precise word choice and evocative imagery. However, the piece relies on a recurring syntactic structure—parallel phrases and constructions like "a [noun] of [abstract noun]"—that occasionally reads as a stylistic tic or template. While this creates a distinct rhythm, its frequency slightly mutes the overall effect and prevents the prose from reaching the highest echelon of variety and effortlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are crafted with a jeweler's precision. The piece is held back from a higher score by a few instances of thematic scaffolding that feel slightly less organic than the surrounding prose, such as "This is preservation." These moments, while poetically phrased, function as slight authorial intrusions that explain what the rest of the story so beautifully shows.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, polished, and powerful, with strong verbs and evocative figurative language. Each sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere and internal state. The sheer density of metaphors borders on overwriting in a few places, creating a texture so rich it risks slowing momentum, but it never crosses the line into obscuring clarity and ultimately serves the story's unique voice.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise language. Sentences are constructed with a poet's ear for rhythm and syntax, accelerating and slowing with the scene's needs. While the prose is highly figurative, the metaphors ("time slowed like syrup under moonlight," "devotion pulsed like a neutron star") are coherent and serve the story's tone without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is a standout strength, marked by high information density, varied sentence structure, and precise, evocative language ("a cathedral of instability," "the body’s quiet archive"). The rhythm and flow are excellent, accelerating and slowing with the character's internal state. There are no discernible loops or scaffolding. The piece is highly polished, with only a very occasional phrase that feels slightly more writerly than the surrounding text, a minor point in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is the story's crowning achievement: dense, rhythmic, and luminous. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing the narrative while building a thick, tangible atmosphere. Word choice is precise and evocative ("petrified sentinels," "opalescent" fog, "bruised violet sky"). There are no wasted words, scaffold phrases, or loops; the information density is extremely high, and the syntax modulates perfectly to match the ritual's cadence, achieving a rare level of stylistic and narrative fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is luminous and precise for the most part. However, a significant line-level artifact mars the otherwise polished craft: the exact phrase “her forgotten bag’s contents” is repeated verbatim. This repetition is jarring and reads like an unedited tic rather than an intentional echo. While the rest of the prose is strong, with excellent sentence variety and information density, this noticeable flaw prevents a higher score in a category that demands line-level perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, imagistic, and flawlessly executed. Every sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere, character, or concept. Phrases like "origami traps" and "absurdity was the midwife of revelation" demonstrate both precision and imaginative flair. The language is sophisticated without being overwrought, and the rhythm of the sentences modulates perfectly between the dreamlike orchard and the stark bathroom. There are no wasted words, loops, or clunky constructions; the craft is pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language, such as "syntax that bent causality" and "gravity seemed to stutter," is both beautiful and functional, advancing atmosphere and world rules simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is crafted at an extremely high level, with remarkable density and precision. Figurative language is inventive and generally serves the story's atmosphere and themes well. While the sheer lushness occasionally verges on overwhelming, it remains controlled and purposeful, avoiding critical flaws like mixed metaphors or rhythmic monotony, ultimately contributing to the story's unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative word choice ("dormant syntax," "dissonant whole"). The prose is clean and elegant, with no scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts. Every sentence serves to advance the story's purpose, resulting in a piece that is both concise and deeply atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic propulsion. Figurative language is both vivid and functional, as in "a shattered mirror refusing to fall," which conveys visual information and thematic tension simultaneously. There are no wasted words, scaffold phrases, or loops; every line serves to build atmosphere or advance the accumulative pressure toward the climax. The line-level craft is polished to a professional standard.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptional, demonstrating high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative word choice in every line. Figurative language, such as "the air thickened like cooling honey," is vivid without becoming overwrought. The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or syntactic monotony, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and highly polished, demonstrating superior line-level craft. Figurative language is consistently original and effective, such as shadows being “slow hands of a clock counting griefs” and memories pressed into stone like “fossils of feeling.” There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every sentence serves to build atmosphere and deepen the story's conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and lyrical, yet it maintains clarity, especially during the crucial climax where the language becomes more direct and percussive. Sentences are information-rich, performing multiple functions of characterization, world-building, and atmosphere. The piece is free of noticeable scaffolding or loops; its lushness is a deliberate and controlled feature that defines the story's texture without obscuring its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: elegant, dense, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as moonlight like "memory shards." There are no wasted words, redundancies, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or thematic development. The piece is a model of concision and evocative power.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exquisite, with high information density and precise, evocative language. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, particularly the sustained metaphor of silence having flavors. There are no notable overwriting artifacts, loops, or scaffolding. The sentences are rhythmically varied and propel the narrative with a dreamlike momentum. The only minor imperfection is the slight shift in register for the single expository thematic sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—luminous, controlled, and rhythmically complex. Word choice is consistently surprising yet apt ("iridescent tiles that shimmered like frozen auroras," "a clockwork sigh"). There are no wasted words, prose artifacts, or overwriting; every sentence works to build atmosphere and advance the delicate internal plot with grace and power.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is consistently strong, characterized by high information density, precise word choice, and evocative imagery. Sentences are rhythmically varied and propulsive. While the style verges on ornate, it avoids becoming overwritten by ensuring that figurative language serves character and atmosphere. The summary in the penultimate paragraph ("She understood then...") is a strategic and efficient choice for denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is superb, with high information density and powerful, rhythmic sentences. The prose is clear despite its metaphorical richness. A minor deduction is for a slight tendency toward overwriting in a few spots, where the density of figurative language is so high it risks becoming a uniform texture. For example, "its outline blurring like ink in rain, as though the world itself refused to hold the boundary any longer" is a beautiful but conceptually dense pairing that slightly slows propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly effective, with strong verbs and specific, evocative imagery from the opening sentence. Information density is high, with nearly every line contributing to character, atmosphere, and momentum. While the language is elevated ("shadowseam wonder," "liquid potential"), it remains coherent with the story's speculative tone and avoids becoming overwrought, demonstrating confident line-level craft without any notable artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant, with a strong, varied rhythm and high information density. However, there are a few moments where the figurative language becomes slightly too abstract and dense, bordering on overwritten, such as the description of intuition as a “living lattice of memory and resonance.” While the overall quality is exceptional, these brief instances slightly impede momentum in what is otherwise a flawless piece.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is rich and inventive ("glass bent like breath," "laughter caught in the throat of sorrow") but always serves to clarify and deepen the scene rather than obscure it. The piece is free of scaffolding or loops; every sentence works to advance the accumulative pressure toward the climax, resulting in a text that is both beautiful and relentlessly propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in most lines. Sentences like "...stories ended in ellipses, not epilogues" are masterful. The momentum flags slightly in the penultimate paragraph, which summarizes the outcome ("And so, day by day, shelf by shelf...") rather than letting the prior scene's power stand on its own. It's a minor piece of scaffolding that slightly softens an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative, well-integrated figurative language ("wires like veins drained of life"). The sentence and paragraph structure varies effectively to control pacing. The score is held just below the 9-band due to a few phrases that feel like thematic labels ("simple, brutal, pure," "weren't lies — they were restorations"), slightly breaking the immersive texture of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet remains clear, purposeful, and propulsive. Each sentence is meticulously crafted to advance atmosphere and meaning, with high information density and a varied, musical rhythm. While the style verges on ornate, it never feels overwritten; instead, it is the precise and necessary vehicle for the story's specific tone and ambition. There are no wasted words or line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that prevent a top score. The phrase "...from the soil emerged transformed always..." is syntactically awkward and feels like an inorganic insertion. While the rich figurative language is mostly a strength, it occasionally verges on being overwritten, slightly impeding momentum without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control in every line. Figurative language is both original and precise, such as vines swallowing iron frames "like green teeth." There are no wasted words, no boilerplate phrases, and no instances of overwriting; every sentence propels the story's mood and meaning forward. The piece is a model of clarity, concision, and evocative power.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with powerful imagery and a strong rhythmic sense. However, the score is held back by a few instances of register drift into abstract, explanatory language, such as "factually mystical in its resonance" and "magic as consequence." These phrases momentarily break the narrative spell by explaining the concept rather than purely dramatizing it, feeling like authorial intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and often stunning. However, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally risks becoming overwrought, slightly dulling the impact through saturation. More critically, the final paragraph functions as a summary loop, restating the story's premise in abstract terms rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, a stylistic risk that succeeds completely by creating the story's immersive, otherworldly atmosphere. Sentence structure and rhythm are expertly controlled, mirroring the protagonist's internal state of tension and release. Information density is high, with nearly every line advancing character, world, and theme simultaneously, and there are no discernible prose artifacts or loops to break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is rich and purposeful, particularly in the opening, establishing a world that operates on metaphoric logic. Crucially, the prose strategically simplifies at the story’s climax ("Tiny figures emerge..."), allowing the power of the event to land with clarity and force. There are no notable line-level artifacts, loops, or redundancies; the piece is polished to a very high standard.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and often stunning, with phrases like "a sigh woven into the settling of old timber." It demonstrates excellent rhythm and syntactic variety. The score is held back slightly by a few instances that feel overly written or explanatory, such as "his skillfully observant eyes" and the analytical summary of his burden. These moments momentarily break the otherwise immersive and concrete texture of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, precise, and highly figurative without becoming overwrought. Each sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere and conceptual weight, showcasing high information density with no scaffolding or redundancy. The rhythm is varied and controlled, accelerating during the rupture and settling into a quiet cadence at the end. The line-level craft is nearly flawless, with strong verbs and specific imagery throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, polished, and consistently purposeful. Figurative language like "rosary of regrets" and "marble veined with fossilized starlight" builds the atmosphere while also doing character work. While lush, the writing avoids becoming overwritten by ensuring each sentence advances the story's emotional or narrative state. There are no discernible loops, redundancies, or scaffolding; the propulsion is steady and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and rhythmically sophisticated. However, its greatest strength—its imagistic density—occasionally borders on being overwritten. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, and while they are individually strong, their sheer volume can feel slightly strenuous in moments of high tension. A touch more restraint would allow the most powerful images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly evocative, with consistently strong verbs and specific, sensory nouns that carry the story's momentum. Figurative language, such as the factory whistle's "dying breath" or the stone sealing with a "sound like a closing eyelid," is both beautiful and functional. The piece is almost entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, demonstrating a high degree of line-level polish and confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong, evocative verbs and a varied, compelling rhythm. Sentences are crafted for propulsion and impact, doing significant work to build atmosphere and character simultaneously. A few phrases lean towards abstraction ("scaffold complexity with simplicity"), but the line-level execution is overwhelmingly clear, specific, and free of loops or other artifacts, especially during the crucial climactic beats.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with a varied sentence rhythm that shifts effectively in the final paragraphs to create a powerful cadence. While the figurative language is consistently vivid ("dusk bruised the horizon," "icicles weeping"), its sheer density occasionally verges on overwriting, with metaphors appearing in nearly every sentence in some passages. This high density slightly encumbers the momentum but does not create incoherence or obscure the story's powerful final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is distinguished by its rhythmic, evocative prose and high information density. However, the relentless density of figurative language occasionally verges on being overwritten, and a few phrases lean towards the cliché (e.g., "tears carving paths"). The line "a fitting metaphor for truth itself" is a minor piece of authorial scaffolding that a demanding editor would trim.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic, with a high information density that makes nearly every line work to advance atmosphere or theme. While the density of figurative language verges on overwriting, it remains coherent and powerful, establishing a distinct and effective rhythm. The craftsmanship is clean, with no verbal tics, loops, or scaffolding to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, varied syntax, and evocative, precise language. Figurative language, such as "the hush like a dropped stitch in the world’s fabric," is fresh and purposeful, enhancing meaning without clutter. The prose is the story's greatest strength, propelling the narrative with an elegant momentum from start to finish, with no visible scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is dense with original, evocative imagery (“stillness screams,” “seams of release,” “ice began to weep”). While the language is consistently figurative, it avoids feeling overwritten by maintaining a coherent vision and emotional logic. There are no wasted words or clunky phrases; every sentence contributes to the story’s propulsion and atmosphere. The rhythm and cadence are masterfully controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language. However, the final paragraph contains a significant prose artifact; it shifts from showing to telling, summarizing the character's calling and the story's theme in abstract terms. This scaffolding in the final moments dulls the impact of the otherwise stellar prose and prevents a score in the 9+ range.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, poetic, and demonstrates high information density without feeling cluttered. Figurative language is inventive and purposeful, as in "vulnerability wearing its most radiant armor." The piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, and its sentence structures vary to create a compelling, hypnotic rhythm that supports the meditative tone. The line-level craft is exceptional and serves the story's aims at every turn.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, beautiful, and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft. Information density is high, with sentences that are both evocative and purposeful. While the elevated, figurative language is consistently maintained and stylistically coherent, its sheer density approaches the edge of being overwrought. It never crosses into muddle, but a slight variance in texture might have heightened the impact of its most powerful moments.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate, with high information density and evocative, precise language. Figurative language is consistently strong and fresh (“cracked open the earth like an old book”). The rhythm of the sentences modulates perfectly with the story's pacing, and there are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. It’s a polished, professional piece of writing at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious, with a varied, poetic rhythm and high information density. While many images are stunning ("a falling star made of twine"), the sheer density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly dulling the impact of individual metaphors. A few lines also create conceptual loops by restating the core theme, preventing the line-level craft from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in most lines (e.g., "architecture not built, but coaxed"). The rhythm is controlled and deliberate, mirroring the protagonist's movements and mindset. While the quality is exceptionally high, a few phrases like "whispered to the trees, urging them into new geometries" verge on being slightly abstract in a story otherwise grounded in concrete action, a hairline flaw preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is dense with meaning yet clear and propulsive, balancing complex sentences with short, impactful statements. Figurative language is consistently fresh and integral to the theme ("longing had a molecular weight," "the grammar of solitude"). The piece is entirely free of loops, scaffolding, or overwriting, demonstrating a rare level of polish and control.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating remarkable density and precision. Figurative language is consistently striking and purposeful, as in "the sun bled orange into indigo" or seeds with a "latent green scream." While richly poetic, the language rarely feels overwritten, instead serving the accumulative, incantatory rhythm of the piece. The syntax is varied, the word choice is inspired, and there are no discernible loops or scaffolding to weaken its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and imagistic, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. The language is a significant asset, creating a memorable atmosphere from the first sentence. The only minor weakness is the sheer density of figurative language, which, while beautiful, occasionally borders on overwriting and slightly slows the momentum in moments of discovery. However, the craft is overwhelmingly strong, with no technical errors, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is vivid, original, and purposeful, enhancing the atmosphere without ever feeling overwritten or obscuring meaning ("each star’s passage lingering like a held note in a silent cathedral"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and textural depth. The piece is a masterclass in concision and evocative detail.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and stunningly original figurative language ("wind howled like a choir of forgotten gods," "endgames that wept like widows"). There are zero technical flaws, loops, or overwrought passages; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere with precision and poetic force. The prose is the story’s most significant achievement, demonstrating a rare level of mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with each sentence carrying significant weight. Figurative language, such as "silences shaped like breaths," is consistently original and purposeful. Despite its lyrical quality, the writing remains clear and propulsive, with no discernible scaffolding or overwriting. The final lines, in particular, demonstrate immense control and deliver the story's emotional and thematic payload with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and flawlessly executed. Figurative language is consistently original and effective, as in "memory... slicing through her like obsidian wind" or shelves shifting "like tectonic plates." There is zero scaffolding, redundancy, or syntactic monotony; every line serves to build atmosphere, advance the internal state, and propel the reader toward the resonant conclusion. The piece is a testament to the power of precise, poetic language.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—lyrical, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative ("cobblestones held their breath," "presence compressed," "triumph that tasted like ash"). The piece demonstrates exceptional syntactic variety and rhythmic control, with not a single wasted word or sentence. There are no loops or overwritten passages; every line serves to heighten atmosphere, advance the internal journey, and charge the final, resonant images.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and powerful, specific imagery ("porcelain smiles," "glue that never dries"). The sentence-level propulsion is strong, carrying the story's poetic logic forward with a steady rhythm. There is a slight tendency towards abstraction in a few key phrases ("devotion to complexity") that could have been rendered more concretely, but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise polished and impactful piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with powerful imagery throughout. Sentences are well-crafted for propulsive momentum. A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances where the lyrical voice gives way to slightly more prosaic phrasing, such as "metaphorically and literally." The final paragraph, while thematically impactful, leans into summary, a slight departure from the otherwise consistently imagistic and action-oriented prose.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is the story's greatest strength: it is dense, precise, and resonant. Every sentence serves a purpose, and the figurative language is both original and illuminating ("temporary eternity, where moments pooled like tidepools"). The piece is free of line-level artifacts, achieving a rare level of polish.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently luminous and demonstrates high information density. Word choice is precise and evocative, with strong verbs and striking figurative language. The rhythm is controlled, creating a humming, resonant effect that mirrors the story's core concept. A minor deduction is made for a few instances of patterned phrasing, like the anaphora in the final paragraph ("This was her lighthouse. This was her language."), which, while stylistically deliberate, feels slightly less organic than the prose preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by its density, precision, and rhythmic beauty. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful (e.g., "her intuition bleeds sideways," "cathedrals of missed connections"), elevating the concept rather than merely decorating it. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or the accumulative pressure. The final line is a perfectly tuned cadence that lands with immense weight.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: elegant, dense with meaning, and rhythmically controlled. Word choice is precise and evocative, and figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful ("roots that arched like ribs," "orchard sighing behind her like a lung"). The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts; every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or action with remarkable concision and power.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery ("a whisper of alpine wind trapped in coastal gloom") that builds a powerful atmosphere. Sentence structure and rhythm vary effectively, creating a momentum that is both quiet and compelling, with no discernible technical flaws, loops, or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and economical, with high information density in every sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative ("lodestone," "petrichor," "phosphorescent"), and the rhythm of the sentences modulates effectively with the story's pacing. The comparison of the world inverting "like a page turning in a well-bound book" is a perfect, story-specific simile. The execution is nearly flawless, with only the minor thematic telling in the final paragraph creating a slight drag on an otherwise propulsive and polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, its greatest strength is also a minor flaw; the prose is so consistently figurative that it borders on being overwritten. The density of similes and metaphors in nearly every sentence ("whispered against her skin like regret," "curling its fingers," "like mercury wine") slightly dulls the impact of the most powerful images. It's a high-level execution, but a more judicious use of figurative language would have increased its power.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and a controlled, elegant rhythm. The prose is rich with metaphor ("chromatic echoes of courage," "liquid starlight"), but the figures are coherent and serve the central concept rather than feeling decorative. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or wasted words; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and atmosphere, building to a powerful and polished finish.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and exceptionally clean, with no discernible scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is consistently fresh and integrated, serving to heighten the story's atmosphere and psychological stakes (e.g., "the frosting blue as glacier ice, then watch it rot in real-time"). The propulsion is steady, carried by a varied and confident sentence structure that is a pleasure to read.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is of a very high caliber, characterized by dense, evocative imagery and a controlled, poetic rhythm. Sentences are constructed for both meaning and music, such as "calm as moonlit water" or "a quiet monument to labor, both mechanical and mortal." The prose avoids overwriting by ensuring each metaphor serves the story's core thematic concerns, resulting in a piece that is both beautiful and propelled by its language.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with vivid, precise word choice and varied sentence structures that mirror the narrative tension. Figurative language is strong and avoids cliché, such as the air feeling like "wool soaked in honey." The final sentence, while thematically slightly on-the-nose, also feels a little too perfectly alliterative, a minor slip in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with evocative imagery from the very first line. The introduction of the "induced currents" generator is a high-risk conceptual leap, and while the prose carries it, the shift in reality feels slightly abrupt. This moment, where the scent becomes visible, borders on overwriting, but it is a minor friction in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is ambitious, elegant, and highly effective, characterized by high information density and evocative figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, dense, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, propelling the narrative forward. The main weakness is a slight tendency toward overwriting in the final paragraphs, where abstract, high-register phrases ("cracked open time itself," "mercy flowed—not as absolution, but as continuation") feel less grounded than the potent, concrete details that precede them, creating a minor register drift at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and dense, yet maintains exceptional clarity and momentum. Figurative language, such as memories being "auroras trapped in glass," is consistently inventive and thematically resonant rather than merely decorative.

There are no wasted words or scaffold phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Lines like "The wind carried his guilt upward, soft as falling ash" are exceptional. The rhythm is well-paced, and the word choice is precise. The score is held back slightly by the same issue noted in Q5: a few sentences feel like thematic scaffolding, stating what the story is otherwise showing, which momentarily breaks the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is stunning, with high information density and evocative, precise language from the very first sentence. However, the prose is so consistently rich and figurative that it occasionally borders on being overwritten, particularly with phrases like "spiralingly calm." While this dense style is largely effective for the story's mythic mode, a slight pull-back in a few places would have heightened the impact of the most crucial images.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.3)

    The prose is polished to a mirror shine—dense, rhythmic, and devoid of extraneous words. Figurative language is fresh and potent ("shavings curling like ghosts," "petals the color of old bruises"). The sentence structure varies to control momentum, and the short, declarative statements used for the character's narrations land with force. There are no loops, scaffolding, or overwriting; every line serves to advance the story's atmosphere and meaning with remarkable efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often breathtaking in its precision and rhythm. However, it is marked by one conspicuous flaw: the overuse of the "not X, but Y" construction. This repetitive syntactic template appears multiple times, creating a cadence that, while initially effective, becomes a noticeable authorial tic that slightly undermines the prose's otherwise organic and innovative quality.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous, precise, and controlled. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to create a compelling cadence that mirrors the story's quiet, deliberate pace.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences like "Her conviction—once sturdy as oak—had cracked like thin ice beneath her boots" are precise and powerful. The score is tempered by a few instances of register drift, where abstract, academic phrasing ("redemption implied erasure," "compassion no longer required naivety") feels imposed upon the narrative rather than emerging organically from the character's perspective.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished and demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and figurative language, with very high information density. There are no wasted words or scaffolding. The only minor slip is a brief drift into abstraction ("rewriting its tale from tragedy to threshold") in a story that is otherwise grounded in concrete, powerful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is strong, characterized by high information density, varied sentence structures, and powerful, concrete imagery. The prose is clean, avoiding common artifacts like loops or scaffolding.

    The prose is luminous and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft, with high information density and a varied, compelling rhythm. Figurative language is rich but remains coherent and in service of the established voice and atmosphere. While the density of metaphor borders on overwriting, it's a consistent stylistic choice taught early and sustained effectively, resulting in a piece with virtually no wasted words or unforced errors.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and precise, unusual word choices. The rhythm and syntax support the story's somber, hopeful mood. The final sentence ("But silence, unpardonable as it was, could be broken—and in breaking, remade.") feels slightly like authorial summary, a piece of scaffolding that states the theme too directly after the action has already shown it so powerfully, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is highly polished, with evocative, rhythmic sentences and high information density. There are no technical errors like loops or scaffolding. The prose occasionally verges on being overwritten due to the sheer density of its metaphors ("dense as grief," "ink bleeding through parchment"), which, while beautiful, slightly tempers the propulsion in a few moments.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic variation, and precise, evocative language. Sentences are constructed with an architect's care, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, the repeated use of anaphora (“not peace, but clarity,” “not from clouds, but from the earth”) creates a noticeable template cadence that, while stylistic, slightly reduces sentence-level propulsion. This pattern, while controlled, constitutes a recurring prose artifact that prevents the piece from achieving true line-level flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, operating at a very high level of craft. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful ("cracks spiderwebbed across its surface—not breaking, but blooming"). Sentences are varied and propulsive, with no evidence of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting. Every line works to build atmosphere, character, and momentum toward the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, precise imagery, and a varied, elegant rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly effective, with memorable and original phrasing ("Is grief just gravity wearing a different name?"). While the figurative language is occasionally stacked heavily, it remains coherent within the story's established lyric mode and serves the accumulative structure. The rhythm and sentence variety are excellent, propelling the narrative with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb. Information density is high, with sentences like "The camp around her was a sculpture of erosion" doing immense work in a few words. The prose is clean, propulsive, and free of artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding that slightly mar the prose, such as the direct statement, "Her motivation was not rebellion, not glory, but to provoke an unspoken conversation." While the prose is largely excellent, these few moments of telling over showing create a small drag on momentum and prevent a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with striking and precise imagery ("liquid gold," "engraved quiet"). The line-level craft is generally exceptional, with varied sentence structures and strong momentum. A minor weakness is a tendency towards abstraction in a few key phrases, such as "She inculcated plants with values," which tells what could be more fully shown, momentarily thinning the otherwise rich texture.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and almost flawless, with high information density in every line. Figurative language is not an adornment but the fundamental medium of world-building ("silence hummed louder than any storm," "The sky became floor. The silence became teeth.").

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by a strong, varied rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative, with powerful constructions like "silence corrodes faster than ink." While the figurative language is consistently strong, a few moments verge on being overwritten, slightly weighing down the momentum with their poetic density, such as the initial description of the stars' "orbits of regret."

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, musical, and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft. Figurative language is inventive and consistent with the story's internal logic ("broken gramophones spun static into symphonies").

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, marked by evocative imagery and a confident, rhythmic cadence. Sentences are dense with meaning and propulsion. A minor weakness is a tendency towards occasional overwriting, where figurative language is stacked heavily, such as describing the "lilac unease" as "soft, lavender-tinted discomfort." While beautiful, these moments can slightly impede momentum by over-defining an emotion that is already well-established.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic cadence that supports the solemn tone. Figurative language is consistently strong ("wind whispered... as if mourning aloud," "survivors emerged like shoots after frost"). There is a slight tendency toward schematic parallelism in the "renaming" section (noun to "noun of noun"), but it's stylistically justified by the ritualistic nature of the act itself and does not detract from momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, a high-risk style that succeeds due to its consistency and purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, a few key moments dip into thematic summary, slightly undermining the otherwise flawless "show, don't tell" execution. Phrases like "The transitional object had become a conduit" state the concept directly, where the preceding action had already made it beautifully clear.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is elegant and dense with purposeful imagery, creating a rich, immersive texture. The prose demonstrates excellent rhythmic control and syntactic variety, propelling the reflective narrative forward without a single wasted word. While the figurative language is exceptionally dense, it remains coherent and serves the story's atmospheric goals.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are well-crafted and propel the narrative with a quiet intensity. The score is slightly tempered by a tendency toward a high density of figurative language and a recurring use of parallel negative constructions ("not X, but Y") that occasionally feels like a stylistic tic rather than an organic expression.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates exceptional control of rhythm and imagery. However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, occasionally creating a texture so rich it borders on overwriting. Phrases like "percolated truth," "palimpsest promise," and "unpicking the seams of memory" are powerful individually but their close clustering creates a slight sense of artifice. This is a hairline flaw in an otherwise masterful performance, but it prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and striking, original metaphors ("dunes that shifted like liquid regret," "summers stacked like honeycomb"). There is a high degree of information density and rhythmic control, with sentence and paragraph lengths varied for effect. While the figurative language is pervasive, it rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story's accumulative power and textural richness. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or proofreading errors.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence advancing atmosphere, character, and action simultaneously. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, avoiding cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere with precision. Word choice is impeccable and the rhythm of the sentences modulates beautifully with the pacing of the scene. Despite its lushness, the writing avoids overwriting; its metaphors are coherent and consistently build upon the story's core concepts, like memory as light and the library as a living being.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control. Phrasing like "stitching longing into syntax" and "silence pooled like liquid light" is both beautiful and functional. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, even during the fantastical climax. The final paragraph risks abstraction but lands effectively due to the strength of the preceding concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with fresh and effective figurative language ("peeling skin from an apple"). Sentences are crafted with a strong rhythm and clarity. A minor deduction is made for a few phrases, like "the physics of hope," that verge on thematic labels in a narrative that otherwise demonstrates its ideas with superb subtlety through action and image.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense with information, demonstrating strong rhythmic control and syntactic variety. Word choice is precise and evocative, contributing significantly to the powerful atmosphere. While the density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwritten ("each chord a lament for lost geometry"), it remains coherent and serves the story's elevated, fantastical tone without sacrificing clarity at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and evocative, with many powerful images ("mist coiling around her ankles like guilt made visible"). However, it occasionally strays into overwriting, with abstract summations that feel less grounded than the sensory details, such as "She lanced the mystery not with accusation, but by unifying opposites." While generally excellent, these few moments of abstraction slightly soften the otherwise sharp, tactile prose, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and high-impact, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-paced, building momentum effectively toward the climax. The score is slightly tempered by a tendency toward overwriting in the final beats, where a cascade of figurative language ("dawn itself were being rewound," "charted...by mercy") risks blunting the sharpness of the resolution with abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking, original imagery. However, a minor but noticeable artifact prevents a perfect score: the repetition of the phrase “dynamically observant” to describe both the hands and the gaze. In a piece striving for this level of polish, such a repetition stands out as a slight misstep that an editor would flag for refinement, momentarily breaking the otherwise seamless flow.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with high-quality figurative language. However, the intentional repetition of key phrases like "polished calm" and "dusky harmony," while creating a motif, feels slightly heavy-handed by the end. The sheer density of metaphor occasionally risks becoming overwrought, pulling back from perfect line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both lyrical beauty and high information density without a single wasted word. Sentences like "to transmute sorrow into syntax" and "meteor showers of mercy" are stunningly crafted and thematically potent.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly polished, demonstrating a command of rhythm and imagery. Sentences like "her guarded heart a fortress of moss and marrow, built to withstand the erosion of memory, the siege of regret" are both beautiful and purposeful. While the language is consistently elevated and metaphorical, it avoids feeling overwritten by staying anchored to the story's core emotional and thematic concerns. There are no wasted words or line-level artifacts; the craft is clean and confident.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and evocative, with a strong, confident rhythm. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, consistently building atmosphere and meaning, as in "a time-rift stitched with static and smoke." While the style verges on being overwritten, it remains controlled and avoids muddle, and there are no discernible scaffold phrases or repetitive loops, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lush, rhythmic, and dense with evocative imagery ("roots threading through femurs and skulls like lovers reconciling after war"). While consistently beautiful, the sheer density of figurative language is relentless, occasionally feeling overwrought and leaving little room to breathe. There are no technical flaws, but the uniform richness slightly dampens the impact of the most powerful images.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of immaculate quality—dense, rhythmic, and precise. Every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or theme, with zero scaffolding or redundancy. Phrasing like "The question didn’t arrive as epiphany, but as erosion" and "a vessel for resonance without source" demonstrates extraordinary line-level craft and conceptual clarity. The syntax and rhythm shift beautifully from the clipped, factual tone of the beginning to the more lyrical, open-ended feel of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, with high information density and striking imagery ("halos that hovered like unfinished thoughts"). The syntax is varied and supports the story's meditative, deliberate momentum. A minor deduction is for a few phrases that lean slightly into thematic summary, such as "The physics of transition wasn’t in the leaving. It was in the lingering," which slightly abstracts an insight that was already being powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and largely brilliant, with high information density and a varied, compelling rhythm. The figurative language is potent and original. However, a few moments verge on cliché ("creaking like old bones," "smiled, not with lips, but with soul"), and the sheer density of metaphor occasionally risks becoming overwrought, representing a hairline fracture in an otherwise flawless surface that prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise language ("smooth as a held breath," "trembling halos").

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language. Sentences like "mist coiled into grammatical structures, punctuation marks floated like fireflies" demonstrate a mastery of image and rhythm. The prose is consistently elegant and purposeful, free of scaffolding or redundancy, ensuring that every word contributes to the story's momentum and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is simply stunning, with near-flawless execution at the line level. Figurative language is dense but always purposeful and coherent, as in "constellations that shimmered like bruised mulberries against indigo silk." The piece demonstrates exceptional information density and syntactic variety, creating a propulsive reading experience with zero overwritten passages or prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating superior rhythm, density, and precision. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful ("pooled like liquid radiance, never evaporating, never dimming"). There are no line-level artifacts, loops, or wasted words; every sentence contributes to the story's "radiant hush" and moves the ritual forward. The elevated, incantatory style feels perfectly matched to the subject matter.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, rich with sensory detail, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. While the density of figurative language is high, it generally serves the story's lyrical tone. There are a few moments where the prose feels slightly overwritten or self-conscious (e.g., "scalloped the edges of her thoughts"), but there are no technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, and the clarity of the closure scene remains untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong rhythm and word choice. However, a few minor blemishes—a slightly common simile ("like a long-held breath") and a touch of abstract labeling ("Protected vulnerability")—prevent a higher score. While the overall craft is very strong, these small slips slightly dull the edge of an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly polished. Word choice is consistently strong, favoring specific, evocative language (“slab of obsidian,” “cobalt and pearl”) over ornamentation. Sentence structure varies to control rhythm, accelerating with the gust of wind and settling back into the contemplative hush. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the progression of Kael’s understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and highly polished, with striking and memorable phrases like "physics dressed in reverence." The rhythm is controlled and deliberate, mirroring the skimmer's stillness. There is a slight over-reliance on parallelism as a rhetorical structure (e.g., "each groove a prayer, each facet a plea" followed later by "Each bird was a note; each turn, a chord"), which marks the prose as highly stylized but slightly patterned.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density and a varied, poetic rhythm. Sentences like "...lingering luminance, the ghost-light of spells long expired, still clinging to surfaces like memory to regret" demonstrate exceptional craft. There are no significant loops, overwriting, or scaffolding; the language serves the story with clarity and momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with precise word choice and evocative imagery that drive the story's momentum. Sentences are crafted with a poet's ear for rhythm. The only notable flaw is the series of thematic statements in the penultimate paragraph, which reads like a scaffold explaining the story's meaning. While consistent with the voice, this brief lapse into abstraction is a small but distinct prose artifact in the final third, slightly dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative. However, the density of similes and metaphors ("like a dying pulsar," "like sugar in hot tea," "like a bell forged in zero gravity," "like fallen stars") occasionally verges on overwriting. While each comparison is individually strong, their high frequency slightly thickens the texture of the prose, momentarily drawing attention to the craft itself rather than the experience. This is a minor flaw in an otherwise stellar piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with high information density and powerful, precise imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the solemn mood perfectly. The only minor flaw is the direct repetition of the phrase "echoes forgotten phrases," which, while likely intentional, feels slightly less elegant than the surrounding text and breaks the otherwise flawless surface of the prose in its second appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is immaculate. The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with sentences like "equations curling like vines around support beams" demonstrating a perfect fusion of imagery and information. There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and no awkward rhythms. Figurative language is fresh and precise, particularly the final description of the fish as a "question mark against the dawn," which lands with stunning impact. The piece is flawless on a technical level.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—polished, evocative, and efficient. Information density is high, with sentences that simultaneously advance plot, build atmosphere, and reveal character. Figurative language, such as “stitching dignity into disappearance,” is original and precise. The rhythm of the sentences varies to match the narrative's quiet, deliberate pace, and there are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies. It is a piece that demonstrates supreme confidence at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of a very high literary quality, characterized by its high information density, lyrical precision, and rhythmic control. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, consistently reinforcing character and theme ("wings stitching the sky into living runes"). There are no discernible text artifacts, loops, or scaffold; every sentence propels the narrative forward, building a cohesive and immersive atmosphere without a single wasted word.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language ("silence screamed," "silence shaped into reassurance") is purposeful and tonally consistent, reinforcing the central themes. The final sentences achieve a powerful cadence, landing the story’s emotional weight with grace and precision. The piece is free of any distracting line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in most sentences. The rhythm and syntax support the story’s contemplative and climactic moments effectively. A notable flaw is the final sentence, which functions as an explanatory summary, a prose artifact that slightly flattens the momentum of the powerful final image. This minor lapse into abstraction in the final beat is the only significant issue in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and dense with meaning. Figurative language, such as "a question mark made flesh," is consistently striking and purposeful, enhancing atmosphere without becoming overwrought. Sentence structure is varied and rhythmic, propelling the narrative through a decades-long summary with grace and momentum. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no wasted words or line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely brilliant, with a high degree of figurative language that defines the story's texture. Word choices like "macerates" and "dirges" are potent and precise. While the rhythmic parallelism and anaphora are highly effective, a few moments verge on being slightly too self-consciously writerly (e.g., "pendulum counting down to nothing, or perhaps to everything"). These are minor, hairline imperfections in an otherwise stunning and propulsive execution.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, syntactic variety, and startlingly original figurative language that never feels overwrought. Sentences like "light, the guardian had learned, has edges sharper than any blade—and softer than any sigh" are world-class. There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and the prose propels the narrative with a powerful, hypnotic rhythm that is the story's single greatest strength.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from an over-saturation of figurative language. The relentless density of similes and metaphors ("indigo syrup," "petals of frozen bloom," "frost...like lace"), especially in moments of high tension, crosses the line into overwriting. This stylistic choice occasionally blurs focus rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly effective, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, consistently reinforcing atmosphere and theme without becoming overwrought. The line-level craft is exceptionally clean, with varied sentence structures that propel the narrative forward to a powerful, uncluttered climax.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The rhythm and sentence structure vary effectively to match the story's momentum, creating a compelling read-aloud quality. However, a demanding editor would note a slight tendency toward overwriting in a few places, with figurative language or abstract concepts occasionally stacked so densely that they slightly blur an otherwise sharp image ("patient, permanent transience," while thematic, is a prime example).

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=10.0)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep. Figurative language is consistently fresh, purposeful, and integrated into the story's internal logic ("peeled open like an eyelid," "cracked into lace"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence propels the narrative with precision and elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, elegant syntax, and evocative, precise word choice ("unseen architectures draped across spacetime like invisible lace"). There are no textual artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves a purpose. The rhythm of the prose is controlled and contributes significantly to the story's atmosphere, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft without becoming overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong verbs. However, a few phrases lean toward well-worn literary descriptions ("marble veined with forgotten histories," "voice low as falling ash"), which momentarily softens the otherwise sharp and original language. The final paragraph shifts slightly into a summary cadence, explaining the meaning of the preceding actions rather than letting them resonate on their own, a minor but noticeable flaw at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished to a high sheen. Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and varied sentence structures that create a powerful rhythm. Figurative language, such as "claustrophobia a live wire sparking against stone," is fresh and precise. The piece avoids scaffolding, loops, or any textual artifacts, demonstrating a clean and purposeful momentum from the first sentence to the last. The language is elevated but remains anchored to the concrete, sensory details of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and highly controlled, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft with no discernible artifacts or scaffolding. While the figurative language is abundant, it rarely feels overwritten; instead, it serves the story's accumulative strategy, building a thick, coherent atmosphere. Sentences like "frost feathered the glass like breath on a mirror" are both beautiful and precise, advancing tone and setting simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and propelled by strong, clear syntax. Word choice is impeccable, with every image doing multiple jobs, such as the diamond's fractures catching light "like trapped screams." There is zero scaffolding, redundancy, or overwriting; the piece demonstrates remarkable economy and confidence. The rhythm of the sentences perfectly modulates the story’s tension, culminating in the short, impactful lines describing the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, a risk that pays off with startlingly original and evocative imagery ("gravitational giggles," "apologies from abandoned satellites"). Sentence structure is varied and propulsive, accelerating into the climax and settling into a calmer cadence at the end. The language is free of scaffolding or loops, demonstrating high information density and precise word choice throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmically controlled. However, a few minor conceptual loops prevent a 9+ score. The phrasing "uproot the silence... note by note" is echoed later in "uprooted their obedience note by note," a repetition that slightly dulls the impact. This small redundancy, a rare slip in an otherwise pristine piece, is the only element holding it back from near perfection at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and evocative, original figurative language that is integral to the story's meaning. The prose is both lyrical and concise, with no evidence of overwriting, scaffolding, or repetitive phrasing. Every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere, demonstrating a rare level of polish and control.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is luminous and highly crafted, with a density of imagery that sustains the magical atmosphere throughout. Sentences are varied in structure and length, creating a propulsive yet meditative rhythm. While the figurative language is consistently strong ("mist curling around his boots like curious cats"), a few phrases like "cathedral of whimsy" feel slightly overwrought. However, these are minor slips in an otherwise impeccably polished piece with no discernible scaffolding or redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, syntactic variety, and a complete absence of scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language is both beautiful and precise, consistently drawing from the story's unique lexicon of science and literature. Short, declarative sentences ("It shivered. Not metaphorically.") are used to tremendous effect, grounding the fantastical events with undeniable weight. The prose is polished to a mirror shine.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating exceptional rhythm, clarity, and information density on every line. Figurative language is rich but never overwrought, consistently serving the world-building and emotional tone without obscuring momentum. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, showcasing a level of polish and precision that is immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is elegant and rhythmic, but it suffers from a pervasive density of figurative language that verges on being overwritten. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, which, while often beautiful, can slow momentum and feel strenuous. This consistent lack of prose variation, where even simple actions are couched in elaborate phrasing, constitutes a stylistic artifact that slightly dulls the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is of exceptional quality: dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing character, atmosphere, or plot with no wasted words or overwrought flourishes. Figurative language, like the greenhouse as a "cathedral of lost seasons," is both beautiful and precise. The line-level craft demonstrates a rare confidence, trusting potent imagery over lengthy explanation, especially in the climactic sensory return.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating both lyricism and precision. Information density is high, with every sentence serving multiple functions—advancing the atmospheric plot, revealing character, and reinforcing theme. The language is controlled, the rhythm is deliberate, and there are no prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies. It's a polished, confident, and highly effective piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lush, dense, and highly figurative, a bold stylistic choice that succeeds in creating a mythic tone. While risking "overwriting," it maintains coherence and propulsion, with each sentence working to build atmosphere and deepen the central magical act. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The sentence structure varies to create a lyrical, incantatory rhythm that perfectly matches the story's content, particularly during the weaving sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with a strong, controlled rhythm. Figurative language is the story’s lifeblood, though it occasionally strays toward being overwrought (e.g., "moon-silk spun from the last sigh of a drowned lullaby"). However, for the most part, the rich imagery serves the atmosphere and concept effectively. The piece is free of technical errors, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and polish, though the sheer density of metaphor holds it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly figurative, yet remains clear and purposeful. While walking the line of overwriting, it succeeds by ensuring each metaphor (the "cartographic wound," the "grammar" of the stones) serves the central theme and advances understanding. The sentences are elegantly constructed with varied rhythms, propelling the quiet narrative forward with grace and precision; there are no loops or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is lyrical, confident, and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft. It achieves high information density with striking, original imagery and a compelling rhythm. Sentences are varied and purposeful, accelerating or decelerating in step with the narrative's needs. The piece is remarkably clean, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or overwriting; every word serves the story's tightly controlled atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, precise, and consistently beautiful. Figurative language, such as "silence rang like struck crystal" and "You are not error. You are elegy," is both original and emotionally exact. The piece demonstrates remarkable economy, with no wasted words, scaffolding, or rhythmic monotony. Every line works to advance atmosphere, character, and feeling, resulting in a polished, propulsive, and deeply resonant reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly beautiful, with precise, evocative language ("spiraling like breath on ice") and varied sentence structures that propel the narrative. However, the final third contains moments of summary that slightly flatten the prose, such as being told an entry is "a stitch in the fabric of survival." Additionally, a few images, like tears as "tiny lanterns refusing to dim," lean toward being overwrought, preventing an otherwise exceptional piece of writing from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in nearly every line. The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative, methodical pacing, and figurative language is consistently strong ("starlight that clung like powdered memory"). A slight deduction is warranted for the final line's move toward abstraction ("...categorize not just clouds, but courage"), a minor conceptual stutter after a sequence of immaculate, concrete imagery. Otherwise, the line-level craft is free of artifacts and demonstrates exceptional control.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by its precision, rhythm, and high information density. Figurative language is consistently evocative and purposeful, such as "dawn bled through leaves like watercolor on vellum." The piece avoids overwriting; its lushness serves the accumulative build-up of texture and atmosphere. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a seamless and propulsive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, evocative imagery, and a strong, poetic rhythm. Sentences like "light caught mid-flight, never quite landing" are both beautiful and functional. The prose is clean, with no evidence of scaffolding or redundancy, propelling the narrative with grace and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is rich but remains purposeful, contributing to the story's otherworldly atmosphere without veering into overwriting. There are no notable loops, redundancies, or scaffolding. The language is consistently elevated yet clear, propelling the narrative forward with a quiet, confident momentum that culminates in a powerful and clean final line.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and carries high information density without feeling overwrought. The rhythm is expertly controlled, moving from descriptive passages to the propulsive climax with ease. Sentences like "Her whispers didn’t echo; they rooted" and "hope was brambled but blooming" are both beautiful and purposeful. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, even in the most heightened moments.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and poetically charged, achieving moments of stunning beauty ("gulls hung frozen in descent"). It demonstrates exceptional control over rhythm and syntax, creating a propulsive yet stately momentum. While it avoids clear errors like mixed metaphors or loops, the sheer density of figurative language in almost every sentence is a high-risk stylistic choice that borders on overwriting. This prevents a higher score, as it slightly compromises clarity for richness in a few moments.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of immaculate quality, exhibiting high information density and rhythmic grace in every sentence. Word choice is consistently strong and evocative ("crunched brittle shale," "sun bled orange into violet," "last light guttered out"). The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and highly polished narrative surface.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is ambitious, lyrical, and almost flawless, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language. While the density of figurative language is immense, it remains coherent and serves the "symphonically minded" characterization rather than devolving into purple prose. There are no loops or technical errors; the sentences propel the narrative forward with a controlled, musical rhythm that is a pleasure to read.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is immaculate, exhibiting high information density and rhythmic propulsion without a single wasted word or clichéd phrase. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful, seamlessly integrated into the narrative fabric rather than feeling ornamental. There are no loops, scaffolding, or other prose artifacts; the clarity and concision are of the highest caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and evocative, precise language. The prose maintains a very high level of figurative density ("bruised twilight sky," "calcified sea-life frozen mid-bloom") that it successfully sustains, but this high-risk style verges on being overwritten, slightly impeding momentum in a few places.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft. Figurative language is rich but remains coherent and purposeful, building the story's unique atmosphere.

The rhythm and syntax vary beautifully, creating a propulsive yet poetic momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and propelled by a strong internal rhythm. Word choice is precise and evocative, with powerful and consistent metaphors. The piece is almost flawless at the line level. A minor deduction is warranted for a few phrases in the final paragraphs that summarize the theme, slightly slowing the momentum by telling the reader what has just been shown. This minor scaffolding is the only element holding the prose back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, dense, and confident, using specific, strong verbs and vivid imagery to build its world. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the reader forward without any significant loops or scaffolding in the main body of the text. The only weakness is a tendency towards adjectival density ("clandestinely luminous," "fractured cognition," "spectral halos") that occasionally borders on being overwritten, though it largely serves the fantastical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and often stunning, with high information density and precise, evocative imagery. The rhythm and flow are excellent. The score is held back from the highest tier by a slight tendency towards overwriting; the density of figurative language is consistently high, and the final paragraphs stack abstract pairings ("fracture into frequency, silence into song") which, while resonant, feel more like a summary than a final, concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and demonstrates strong command of language. However, it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of abstract nouns and metaphors that occasionally obscure meaning rather than clarify it. Sentences like "...a threshold, an eclipsed covenant between earth and sky, between reason and resonance" stack concepts so heavily that they risk losing their grounding, slightly dulling the momentum with their intellectual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous, dense with inventive and evocative imagery ("blind cartographer mapping unseen coastlines"). The line-level craft is mostly superb, with strong verbs and varied sentence structures that propel the narrative forward. While the high density of figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting, it largely serves the story's lyrical tone without obscuring clarity or momentum in the pivotal closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with vivid figurative language that rarely feels overwrought ("unfurled like a velvet scream"). Sentences are constructed with a clear sense of rhythm and purpose, propelling the accumulative structure forward. There are no notable text artifacts or loops. The only minor weakness is that the very final lines, in their aphoristic perfection, feel slightly less organic than the richly textured prose that precedes them.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm is well-controlled, creating a sense of both wonder and urgency. The only minor flaw is the slight authorial intrusion at the very end, where thematic statements ("Waiting for an intrepid orchard pilot...") replace the pure sensory experience that characterized the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is a model of clarity, precision, and momentum. Sentence structure is varied for rhythmic effect, and word choice is consistently strong and evocative without becoming overwrought. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, demonstrating a high level of craft where every sentence serves character, atmosphere, or the narrative's forward drive.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in every line. However, the sheer, unrelenting density of figurative language—a simile or metaphor in nearly every sentence—occasionally borders on overwriting. This intense lyricism, while consistent with the voice, can slightly blunt the momentum in peak moments by prioritizing texture over propulsion. There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffolds, but the richness is almost overwhelming.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptional: elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as silence falling “like snow after a storm” and shadows pooling “like spilled ink.” There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or momentum. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, demonstrating a high level of line-level mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, precise, and rhythmically complex. However, its immense figurative density occasionally risks becoming overwrought, with nearly every sentence containing a high-concept metaphor ("the slope of a sigh, the integral of a sob"). While this establishes the story's unique voice, a few moments of plainer language might have allowed the most powerful images to land with even greater force. It is virtuosic but verges on overwhelming the narrative action in brief passages.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic propulsion without a single wasted word. Figurative language, such as "routine had calcified her routes" and "the sky bled violet and emerald," is evocative and establishes a consistent, elevated register from the outset. The prose is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, resulting in a clean, polished, and immersive read.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly evocative, with figurative language that consistently deepens atmosphere and meaning without becoming overwrought. Sentence structures are varied, creating a rhythm that mirrors the story’s building intensity and eventual quiet release. There are no discernible loops, scaffolding, or redundancies; every line works to advance the story's accumulative effect, resulting in a piece with exceptional clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is overwhelmingly beautiful, with rich, evocative sentences and a strong rhythmic sense. However, it is marred by a few distinct, mechanical-sounding artifacts that a top-tier publication would not permit. The phrase "a tapestry fraying through the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry" is a clumsy loop, and the clunky repetition in "...etched along their jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box" breaks the otherwise seamless lyricism.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and generally concise, with high information density in its imagery. The line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax and powerful verbs. A handful of phrases feel slightly overwritten or aphoristic ("magic never did when shared without greed"), momentarily pulling back from the immersive prose, but these are minor slips that do not disrupt the story's momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative figurative language, such as "viscous, like stepping through syrup made of memory." The rhythm is controlled and purposeful. A few phrases like "cyclically spontaneous failure" feel slightly more abstract and less grounded than the surrounding prose, but these are minor issues in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless. The prose is both concise and incredibly dense with meaning, achieving a poetic quality through precise word choice and varied sentence structures ("feathered tax collectors," "a draft where safety used to sit"). There are no wasted words, loops, or overwrought metaphors; every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, and the story’s quiet momentum, demonstrating an exceptional command of language.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet it avoids becoming overwrought by maintaining a consistent, earned, mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and propelled by a powerful internal rhythm. Figurative language is sophisticated and precise, never decorative ("patience detonates," "iridescent caution made manifest"). There are no wasted words, scaffold, or loops; every sentence works to advance the story's textural and thematic aims. The final line provides a perfect, resonant closure that exemplifies the piece's masterful craft.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and dense with meaning, propelling the narrative with confidence. Figurative language is generally strong and integrated, such as a chime like "wind through hollow bone." A few phrases, like moonlight being a "blessing" or the slightly programmatic triple-adjective ending, dip into more familiar patterns, but these are rare blemishes on an otherwise polished and evocative piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous and dense with evocative, original imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the dreamlike atmosphere beautifully. A few sentences in the final paragraph approach a paraphrase loop, slightly restating the keeper's achievement and the story's theme in different terms ("She had not fixed the world. She had reminded it..."). This minor redundancy is the only element preventing a near-perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and dense with well-crafted imagery. However, the story occasionally risks becoming overwritten with a high concentration of figurative language that can feel more decorative than propulsive. Furthermore, the final paragraph's shift to abstract summary ("the quiet certainty that...") represents a minor but distinct lapse in craft from showing to telling at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is both lyrical and precise, with high information density in every sentence ("vines swallow marble statues," "crust hardened like old promises"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, consistently reinforcing character and theme without ever feeling overwritten. The rhythm of the sentences shifts appropriately with the character's actions and thoughts, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently stunning, with inventive figurative language and a strong, rhythmic cadence. However, its greatest strength is also a minor weakness; the sheer density of ornamentation is relentless, with nearly every noun modified by a striking adjective. A demanding editor would note this as bordering on overwritten, as the lack of plainer sentences removes opportunities for contrast and can slightly exhaust the reader's palate.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Phrasing is both poetic and precise, with standout lines like "her smile sharp enough to fillet hope" and "fear had long since calcified into purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control. Word choice is consistently surprising and precise ("democracy written in chlorophyll and decay," "bioluminescent ballot-counters"). There are zero textual artifacts; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the atmosphere without a wasted syllable. The figurative language is coherent, fresh, and fully integrated into the story's unique logic.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently strong, marked by high information density and evocative, specific imagery ("praise that tasted like dust," "a tiny bloom of steam and salt"). While the figurative language is dense, it rarely feels overwritten, instead building a coherent, heightened atmosphere. The only minor weakness is a slight tendency toward direct explanation in a few key moments, such as naming the force "resonance," which momentarily pulls back from the otherwise seamless "showing" of the story's magic.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and impeccably polished, with high information density in every line. Word choice is precise and memorable, and sentence structures vary to create a compelling rhythm that carries the story's momentum effortlessly. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwriting; the craft is virtually flawless and transparent.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is consistently elegant and precise, with high information density in its imagery. However, the prose verges on being overwritten; the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally lessens the impact of key moments by removing contrast. Lines like "each shimmer a stanza in the ballad of vanishing cold" are beautiful but ubiquitous, creating a uniform texture that sacrifices some narrative propulsion for poetic effect. There are no technical errors, but a touch more restraint would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative, original imagery ("fireflies made of dread," "frantic cursive against the glass"). Sentence structure and paragraphing vary effectively to control rhythm. There are no notable textual artifacts like loops or scaffolding. The piece is exceptionally clean, though a few phrases lean towards the abstract ("planetary sigh," "world's dissonance") where a more concrete, character-filtered perception might have been even stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in its imagery. Sentences are well-crafted and propel the quiet narrative forward with confidence. The language is precise and avoids overwriting, creating a clear and immersive reading experience. The only minor weakness is that a few similes, like "rough as unwashed linen," feel slightly familiar, though they do not detract significantly from the overall high quality of the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, beautiful, and highly effective, with exceptional information density and syntactic variety. However, its relentless lyricism occasionally tips into abstraction, such as in the line “to weave fragility into cipher so potent that even collapse became a coded triumph.” While powerful, this momentarily steps back from the concrete scene to state a theme, a minor friction in an otherwise stellar performance.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control in every line. Figurative language, such as the whale's ribs like "cathedral buttresses" and salt crystals like "frozen chandeliers," is vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with a strong, varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistently inventive and supports the story's textural aims, as in "a velvet void where meaning pooled and clarified." While the density verges on being overwrought, it ultimately succeeds as a stylistic choice for this specific narrative. The deliberate repetition of key phrases like "terrestrially cosmic" functions as a successful leitmotif rather than a flaw, reinforcing the story's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.9)
    The line-level craft is of the highest caliber, with virtually no wasted words or weak constructions. The prose is elegant and dense with meaning, featuring fresh, evocative figurative language ("grammar in their gables," "fleeting silver scars") that enhances rather than clutters.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, the density of figurative language is relentless, occasionally bordering on overwritten and slowing momentum. A few phrases use a template cadence ("Pain became pattern. Isolation became architecture."), which, while effective, is a minor prose artifact that keeps it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and almost entirely free of artifacts. Every sentence is load-bearing, advancing plot, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. The language is elevated without feeling overwrought, and figurative language, such as the marble vault sighing “open like a held breath released,” is both beautiful and precise. The deliberate repetition of “stalactites drip” and “pearl twilight” creates a resonant, incantatory rhythm that enhances the story's fairy-tale quality.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense with powerful imagery ("woven from silence itself," "shrunk to a sigh curled in the roots of a petrified willow"). While the figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, a few phrases like "through progressive disclosure" and "Her motivation crystallized" lean slightly towards telling and feel a bit more clinical than the surrounding prose. This is a minor friction in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density, precise word choice, and a controlled, poetic rhythm. Sentences like "its miniature town now a slumped, dreamlike smear" and "dawn bleeds violet over the glacier’s crown" are both beautiful and efficient. The prose is free of artifacts, scaffolding, or overwriting, demonstrating a polish and confidence that elevates the entire piece.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.6)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless, exhibiting high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language, such as "starlight caught in a spider’s thread — luminous, yet heavy with the weight of unsung labor," is consistently fresh, precise, and thematically resonant. The prose is clean and propulsive despite its lyrical quality, with no evidence of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, even in its most elevated moments. Every sentence serves character, atmosphere, and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is a significant strength, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative language. Sentences like "each petal’s tremor, each branch’s lean, whispering data beneath the wind’s howl" do immense work in establishing character, setting, and tone simultaneously. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, and its momentum is carried effortlessly by the clarity and propulsion of its line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished, demonstrating a superb command of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are crafted for maximum impact, doing multiple jobs at once to build character, setting, and mood.

There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every line propels the narrative forward with confidence.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and evocative imagery ("sonic reliquaries," "spidery script"). The prose is clean and propulsive, varying sentence structure to create a compelling rhythm. There are no notable scaffold or loop artifacts. A minor deduction is for the final line of the poem ("positively wistful, endlessly bright"), where the adverbs feel slightly less grounded and more sentimental than the story's established salt-stung texture.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lyrical, dense, and propulsive, with vivid imagery and a strong rhythmic quality. Word choice is precise and evocative ("pressure ridges softened like sighs"). The piece avoids scaffolding or loops, maintaining clarity even with its high density of figurative language. The final paragraph's move into summary is a minor blemish on an otherwise stellar line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that verges on being overwritten. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or simile, which, while individually strong, creates a uniform texture that dulls the impact of key moments. A more strategic deployment of this lyricism would have allowed high-pressure beats to stand out with greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished to a fine edge—dense, evocative, and ruthlessly efficient. Every sentence carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, or understanding. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, as in "data wrapped in sorrow, physics steeped in trauma."

    The line-level craft is superb, marked by clarity, concision, and a lyrical rhythm. Figurative language is consistently strong and organic to the story’s world.

Otherwise, the prose is polished, purposeful, and free of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, with figurative language that consistently deepens meaning rather than merely decorating the surface ("a strangely honest concession to the duality of truth and silence").

The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and precise, evocative imagery. The rhythm is controlled, slowing and quickening with the character's focus. While the figurative language is consistently strong, a few moments verge on being overwritten, with abstractions like "whimsy wrapped in earnestness was the truest magic." These are minor slips in an otherwise beautifully crafted piece with no significant artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, striking original metaphors ("origami made of breath"), and a precise, elegant rhythm.

It demonstrates craft of the highest order.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is consistently beautiful, with high information density and varied sentence structures. However, its relentless lyricism occasionally borders on overwriting. In several passages, figurative language is stacked so densely ("curling around ankles and wrists, clinging like dew to spiderwebs at dawn—fragile, luminous, undeniable") that it slightly softens the impact rather than sharpening it. While a clear stylistic choice, a more judicious use of such dense metaphor in high-pressure moments would elevate the craft further.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and possesses a high information density. Word choice is precise and imagery is strong. A minor, recurring stylistic tic of declarative clarification ("Not metaphorically. Not poetically. Literally.") and parallel sentence structures ("She recorded.

    The prose is luminous and dense, with a varied sentence structure that creates a powerful rhythm.

A slight deduction is made for the triple repetition of "reflectively vibrant," which, while thematically central, feels a touch programmatic and momentarily breaks the otherwise seamless craft.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and resonant imagery. The rhythm is well-controlled, supporting the story's quiet momentum. The piece is marred only by a few instances of slightly overwrought phrasing ("honeyed hush," "quietly proactive") and the thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph, which feels like an unnecessary scaffold on an otherwise strong structure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional control over rhythm and imagery. Figurative language like "reality frayed like old parchment" and "gulls crying like editors demanding revisions" is fresh and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.3)

    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and vivid, specific imagery ("breath returned to a corpse of concrete and steel"). The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled. A minor weakness is the slight tendency toward summary in the concluding paragraphs ("Her motivation had never been restoration. It had been revelation."), which momentarily steps back from the scene to explain the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and propelled by a powerful internal rhythm. Figurative language is consistently inventive and purposeful ("time pooled like mercury," "spine curved like a question mark"). The patterned repetition of key phrases like "He bore" and "excruciatingly gentle" is not a flaw but a sophisticated and effective rhetorical device that structures the character's entire emotional arc.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates high information density, but it verges on being overwritten. Nearly every sentence contains a metaphor or abstraction, creating a rich but unvarying rhythm that can feel heavy.

The line-level craft is strong but lacks the final restraint that would make it truly exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic precision, and stunningly original figurative language ("whale-song trapped in glass"). While immensely lyrical, a few moments of direct summary ("She didn’t understand then. She does now.") slightly break the otherwise seamless "show, don't tell" execution. These are minor points in an otherwise flawless performance, preventing a perfect score but not detracting from the overall power.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elevated, marked by dense, evocative imagery and a strong, varied rhythm. While mostly a strength, the sheer density of figurative language occasionally verges on being overwritten, slightly taxing the reader's attention.

Not to stop the creep, but to walk beside it..."), which introduces a hint of scaffold-like structure into an otherwise fluid piece.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose contains moments of striking beauty ("scalpel dipped in honey," "dissolving like sugar in tea") but is marred by noticeable repetition. The phrase "incisively kind" appears three times, functioning as a prose artifact or scaffold that should have been revised. While rhythm and sentence structure are generally strong, these small instances of redundancy prevent the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional tier.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by high information density and precise, evocative language ("a silent scream in the shape of absence"). The prose is lyrical yet propulsive, with figurative language that consistently deepens the story's conceptual framework rather than merely decorating it. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the whole.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in its imagery. However, the sheer density of figurative language, while beautiful, verges on overwriting; nearly every line contains a metaphor or simile. While this supports the lyrical mode, a few moments of plainer language might have provided contrast and allowed the most critical images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and efficient, marked by evocative, original figurative language that enhances the atmosphere without becoming overwrought. The line-level craft is exceptional, with varied syntax and a strong rhythm that propels the narrative. A single phrase, "historically oriented denizens," reads as slightly abstract compared to the surrounding concrete detail, a minor blemish on otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often evocative, the prose suffers from a tendency toward overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and figurative language that can bog down moments of high tension ("threads of consequence snapping like over-tuned violin strings"). Several phrases lean on abstraction where concrete detail would be stronger ("glow that cast no shadow yet bent perception"). The piece would be elevated further by a rigorous line edit to enhance clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly effective, with powerful, original figurative language that rarely falters. Sentences are syntactically varied and propulsive, advancing the story while building atmosphere. While the prose is ambitious and consistently rich, it avoids becoming overwrought or obscuring the narrative's clear momentum and causality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet remains clear and propulsive, a difficult balance to achieve. Each sentence is packed with information and atmosphere, contributing to the story’s "restless euphony." Word choice is consistently precise and evocative ("cumulus swell a fermata," "spiraling staves," "mandalas of audible geometry"), demonstrating exceptional line-level craft with no discernible artifacts or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, as in "spirals that collapsed inward like failed lungs" or the watcher's pivot "like tectonic stone grinding against stone." There is no overwriting or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or momentum. The read-aloud quality is excellent, with varied syntax creating a rhythm that mirrors the story's quiet, dreadful tension.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are crafted with precision and elegance, such as "roots cracking through the platform’s concrete like veins of forgotten time." There are no loops, redundancies, or overwritten passages; every word serves character, atmosphere, or theme. The language is elevated but remains clear and purposeful, accelerating and decelerating in perfect sync with the story's quiet, intense momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is the story's powerhouse, with luminous, precise imagery and a confident rhythm. Lines like "tiles shifting like teeth in a slack jaw" are unforgettable. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally feels overworked, approaching a decorative quality that slightly impedes momentum. A few abstract phrases ("chiseling meaning from interlaced absence") feel less grounded than the potent, concrete details surrounding them, but these are minor flaws in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and exceptionally dense, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. Figurative language, such as "shadows that moved like hesitant thoughts," is both beautiful and functional. A recurring syntactic pattern ("not X, but Y") is used as a deliberate stylistic device to refine concepts, creating a cadence that reinforces the character's methodical mind rather than feeling like a repetitive artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and figurative, yet it maintains clarity and propulsion throughout. While walking the edge of being overwritten, its richness is purposeful, establishing the story's lyric mode from the first line. There are no wasted words, technical flaws, or dissonant metaphors; every sentence works to build the singular, luminous atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of a very high caliber, characterized by its density, precision, and evocative figurative language (“Earth rotate beneath her like a wound turning in its sleep”).

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong verbs and precise, memorable imagery. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to create a compelling narrative flow. A slight deduction is applied for the final few paragraphs, where the prose shifts from showing to strategic telling that borders on thematic summary, slightly slowing the momentum of the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with a strong, consistent rhythm. However, it occasionally displays a tendency towards excessive aphorism and metaphor that slightly lessens its impact. The line, "She synchronized her breaths with the rhythm of the moon phases—not literally, of course, but metaphorically," contains a small, clarifying hedge ("not literally, of course") that is unnecessary. While the line-level execution is superb overall, these minor instances of over-articulation prevent a perfect score in this category.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, muscular, and polished, with virtually every sentence performing multiple functions. Figurative language is inventive and consistent with the character's voice.

The prose is polished, propulsive, and entirely free of scaffolding or redundancy, achieving a rare balance of poetic richness and narrative clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a significant, pervasive structural tic. The "not X, but Y" construction appears over a dozen times, creating a noticeable template cadence that flattens rhythm and feels mechanical ("not grief, nor vengeance"; "not with chants or circles"; "not fear, not excitement"; etc.). This repetitive scaffold, combined with some thematic restatements at the end, constitutes a major line-level artifact that compromises an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, but it remains purposeful and controlled, directly contributing to the story’s atmosphere of "choking beauty."

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is exceptional: dense, precise, and rhythmically controlled. Sentences are crafted for maximum impact and information density, advancing atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously.

Figurative language intensifies pressure without muddle ("regret had magnetized the air"). Final line’s cadence ("beneath a sky that remembered how to hold her") charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor density issues: "vessel scrubbed raw, yet haunted by residue" overlaps abstraction; final paragraph’s "fiercely alive" risks purple prose. No fatal loops, but scaffold lingers in reflection ("Their journey hadn’t begun with steps...") without altering present tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops/scaffold; every line multi-tasks (e.g., "petals fell like slow snow" establishes time/mood/stakes); final line's fractured cadence ("blooming. Still. Always.") heightens closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero scaffold loops; "burnt sugar" and "onyx ink smudged with earth" exemplify textural specificity. Minor deduction for verbatim "choking beauty" repetition in high-pressure beats, slightly muddling emotional escalation at 72%.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; sentences vary rhythm to mirror emotional shifts ("She felt herself lighten, toes lifting..."). "Tears welling—not from sorrow, but release" avoids cliché. Closure beat immaculate; "needle-fine intent" borderline purple but justified by focus.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor mixed metaphor ("waltz of stars... bent time like taffy") and slightly forced simile ("mist curled like loyal cats") create subtle line-level artifacts, but propulsion remains clean with no scaffold loops in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "slant of moonless shadow" does triple duty (atmosphere/action/theme); minor deduction for "dagger points/lullabies" metaphor tension in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; high density in "ribbons of emerald and violet pulsed across the sky, not as spectacle but as scripture" advances atmosphere and theme simultaneously; no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor overwriting ("quartz fractured to reveal its inner fire") slightly muddles peak-beat clarity, but zero loops and high density propel momentum; final line’s "silence was enough" exemplifies strategic telling.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    No loops or scaffold; "prismatic shards across the marble floor—each one a silent herald" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor overwriting in "dignified chaos" description, but figurative language serves accumulative lens without muddling closure’s precision.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "felt the old skin of cynicism peel away" uses cliché phrasing that slightly dulls the climax image; otherwise impeccable rhythm and specificity ("charcoal on torn laundry list") drive momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "emotion conducted physics here more reliably than equations" risks thematic abstraction in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling sensory immediacy despite otherwise masterful propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("smooth as obsidian and humming with latent resonance" does triple duty) but minor register drift in "empirically whimsical" risks abstraction; final line’s "beautifully awake" avoids sentimentality via concrete charge.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "bruised indigo bleeding upward" exemplifies high-density propulsion. One borderline dense phrase ("chromatic echo of words swallowed before they could bloom") slightly muddles but pays off in closure.
