  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, particularly in descriptions linking cosmic and terrestrial phenomena. Some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("Gradual change... but never predictable" restates earlier material). Minor filter-verb accumulation ("she found herself," "she'd begun") dulls immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong imagery and varied syntax, but contains scaffold phrases ("She realized," "She sensed") and one template run in the penultimate paragraph ("She would... she'd craft... she'd teach"). Information density is generally high with purposeful rhythm variation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("silent language of feeling" / "silently expressive"). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance the story but could pack more work. Some filter constructions ("she saw," "Lirael thought") dull immediacy in places without serving voice.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("light erupted—a beam slicing through the water, piercing the surface like a silver sword") but suffers from repetitive constructions and occasional overwriting. Template cadence appears in sequences like "He saw... He woke... He'd booked" and metaphor density occasionally obscures clarity ("tidepool's whisper"). The opening and closing lines effectively frame the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("sanctioned moon," "mosaic of needs") but suffers from tell-heavy passages and abstract metaphors. Several paraphrase loops appear: "fear won't feed us/Trust will" followed immediately by similar sentiment. Filter-heavy construction in middle section ("Mira had noticed," "Mira had told," "Mira disagreed") dulls immediacy during crucial development.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("twilight's magic," "embers carried on the wind," "collective well of unused love") without pattern-teaching, creating purple prose in peak moments. Template constructions like "She knew this was" and "Lira felt" accumulate, while the extended denouement after the pool discovery dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures, but overwriting appears in peak moments ("shower of sparks," "swarm of fireflies"). The fragment "Legend claimed... Elara didn't care about legends" effectively establishes voice. Some figurative density without clear payoff ("like veins," "like dry leaves," "like a question mark") creates mild ornamental excess.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows variety in sentence structure and paragraph length, with strong verbs like "rattled," "clung," "wrenched." However, several template constructions appear ("She'd been... She'd spent... She reached...") and metaphors occasionally strain ("clung to corners like a ghost's whisper"). The phrase "resilience had been planted" abstracts rather than embodies.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "ghostly static of rusted hulls pressing against glass panes" and effective variation in sentence structure. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("She'd harvested them from the shipwrecks" followed by itemized list; "memories fracture" echoed in later passages) and some elevated diction ("ephemeral resonance") occasionally drifts from Lira's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("amber streaks across the platform") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without always advancing pressure. Template cadence in "She'd stolen... She'd learned... She placed it" creates mild repetition. The paraphrase loop "The end, she thought, was just another beginning" following the already-clear transformation dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm shifts, but several instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "contemplative glassblower with fingers calloused from shaping molten silica" could be tighter, and abstract passages like "Abandonment, he mused, was rarely sudden. It was a slow retreat, a chipping away of resolve" create scaffold that tells rather than shows. The final paragraph particularly suffers from explicit theme summary.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose clarity suffers from repetitive structures ("She'd come here after," "She'd found it," "She knelt") and filter-heavy constructions. Template phrases like "trembling certainty" and "rough with emotion" lack specificity. The enforcer section contains multiple filter verbs ("she saw," "She recognized") that dull immediacy during peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The fort's walls groaned, as if annoyed by her intrusion" conveys both setting decay and narrative pressure. Some figurative density in peak moments ("marbled hush," "palimpsest of echoes") but serves the accumulative pattern. Clean propulsion with varied sentence structures maintaining momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean with evocative imagery like "fountains frozen mid-splash" and good syntactic variety. Some overwriting appears in abstract passages ("thoughts were patterns, then time was a tapestry of overlapping threads") and the repeated "remarkably composed" feels mechanical rather than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful details like "frayed gold ticket" and "lens-shaped circle." Information density is solid—most sentences advance discovery or atmosphere. However, repetitive structures appear ("Elias [verb]" patterns) and abstract phrases like "resonant hush that masked something unresolved" lack concrete anchoring. The phrase "ambiguously clear" appears forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose is generally clean with some effective images (marbles as "ledger of resilience"), but suffers from repetitive phrasing around key concepts—"gardens know their gardeners" appears verbatim three times. The final two paragraphs contain exposition that restates rather than advances ("it was not the algorithms that defined success").

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures. Information density is solid—most lines advance plot or atmosphere. Minor redundancy appears in "subdued awakenings" explanation and some filter constructions ("Veyra watched," "Veyra thought"), but these don't touch closure or create loops.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose has strong moments ("sheet music floating like lost confessions") but suffers from filter verb accumulation and some template phrasing ("Clara's breath quickened," "hands trembled"). Information density is generally good but some paraphrase loops exist (water/flooding mentioned redundantly).

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some passages lean toward overwriting ("celestial shroud," "auroral sorrow"). Template cadence appears in "She'd started... She'd dreamed... She'd forgotten" sequence. Information density is good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence lengths and vivid verbs ("yawned," "gnawed," "crescendoed"), though several filter constructions dull immediacy ("Elias's throat tightened," "Elias stood alone"). The paraphrase loop "Some truths, he thought, were too heavy to carry" restates the earlier "weight of a swallowed truth" without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and strategic repetition ("becoming silence, becoming change, becoming nothing"). Some metaphorical density in early paragraphs ("festered like rot beneath moss-choked stone") borders on overwriting, and "across the drift of untold seasons" appears twice identically.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("notes spiraled upward, soft as moth wings") with varied sentence structure and purposeful repetition. However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy ("softly adaptive to Mara's bluntness"), and the final paragraph's "promise of lifelong wonder" slips into elevated register that doesn't quite match earlier texture.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm modulation. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some metaphorical density in the opening ("bones of a forgotten god") and occasional filter verbs ("he wondered," "he realized") create minor drag but don't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery, particularly in atmospheric passages. Some overwriting appears ("slow-burn revolution," "roots twisting through governments and hearts") and the phrase "The game was afoot" feels derivative, but overall the line-level craft serves the story's aims with good momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose has momentum and varies rhythm effectively, particularly in the loop-building sequences. However, several instances of overwriting harm clarity: "muffled clarity" is oxymoronic without payoff, "origami" time-folding remains ornamental, and abstract phrases like "rhetorical devices" and "hidden assumptions" recur without concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "fortunes that weren't predictions but invitations" but suffers from repetitive structures ("She'd grown up," "She'd found it," "She'd learned"). Some abstract telling ("chronological homesickness pulsed") lacks concrete embodiment. Template cadence appears in the fortune-writing sequence with multiple "She [verb]" openings that create monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose alternates between evocative imagery and expository scaffolding. Strong opening creates momentum, but middle sections bog down in conceptual explanation ("The labyrinth wasn't physical—it was temporal"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around Mara's disconnection theme. The final paragraph contains unnecessary summary that diminishes the grounding image's power.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally flows with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition of "hush" that serves the accumulative pattern. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. However, several template constructions appear ("She thought of her students... She thought of her mother") and some abstract phrasing dilutes immediacy ("The cavern's air shifting from crisp to damp to crisp once more").

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("ivy-choked trellis," "oppressive stillness"). Minor template cadence in middle section with repetitive "He [verb]" constructions. The phrase "credibly curious" reads awkwardly as forced element insertion. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"crystal shadows dancing across the walls, shifting hues that mirrored emotions rather than objects"—but suffers from abstract telling in places ("grief wasn't something to be feared"). Some redundancy appears in the explanation of inherited sorrow. The filter verb "she saw" in the vision sequence dulls immediacy where direct perception would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("sky in streaks of violet and molten gold") but suffers from abstract philosophical declarations and repetitive dialogue stems ("The being said," "Kael said"). Template cadence appears in the unraveling sequence, and several passages loop concepts without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("The sunken orchard greenhouse stood like a glass cathedral") with strong sensory layering. Some figurative density in peak beats ("tapestry of memory and hope") and occasional abstraction ("beauty in the unfinished") create minor drag. Information density generally high, though "magnificent simplicity" in the final paragraph reads slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. However, several instances of ornamental language don't advance the story ("dusk's first sigh"), and some phrases edge toward purple prose ("liquid moonlight"). The piece maintains momentum but includes decorative elements that could be trimmed for greater density.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose competence shows in varied sentence structures and clean grammar, but several issues accumulate: redundant phrasing ("paper-scented calm" / "whispers of old stories"), overwritten metaphors ("lighthouse eyes under a crescent moon"), and the abstract "cycles of compassion" that becomes repetitive. The final paragraph's "closed her eyes, listening" attempts profundity through vague gesture rather than specific image.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structure and purposeful imagery. However, several overwrought phrases appear: "where time pooled like liquid mercury," "vibrant tapestry of traders." The metaphor density in the opening paragraph doesn't serve pressure. Some redundancy: "boldly sympathetic, a trait that drew others to him."

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Some figurative density in peak beats ("tunnel was not a passage but a moment") works thematically but occasionally slows momentum. Minor template patterns ("She saw... she saw... she saw") and filter constructions ("Lila knew") reduce immediacy in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Deductions for template phrases ("tears mixing with," "fingers trembling"), some filter constructions ("she saw it," "she felt"), and mild overwriting in figurative density during the ritual sequence. Information density high but occasional redundancy ("secretive conjurer" restated as concept).

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with vivid moments like "dawn crept through...staining the air a sapphire hush." Some repetitive structures ("She'd found," "She'd mapped," "She'd dismissed") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages. The ending risks slight redundancy with both "felt seen" and "become visible" hitting similar notes.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful botanical vocabulary. Information density is good - most sentences advance both external observation and internal realization. Deductions for repetitive "She'd [verb]" constructions in paragraph 6, and some paraphrase loops around the control/release theme that restate without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but several instances of overwriting: "frayed at the edges like a watercolor left too long in the sun" strains the metaphor, and phrases like "haggard awe" feel forced. Some redundancy in description ("black mirror" pooling, multiple water/drowning metaphors) creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and strong sensory specificity. Some overwriting appears ("shadowed figure, a tremor in the earth's song") and occasional elevated diction ("unseen forces are fickle") creates minor register drift, but momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows clearly but suffers from repetitive structure ("Her first stop...Next, she ventured...Her final site") and abstract phrasing ("navigating those absences"). The "mosaic/symphony" metaphors in the closing paragraph feel forced. Information density is moderate—many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates solid craftsmanship with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the opening's long, atmospheric sentence. Some figurative language works well ("like the breath of a sleeping giant"). However, abstract phrases like "trembling certainty" appear multiple times, and several sentences use filter constructions ("he felt," "he'd seen") that dull immediacy. The final paragraph contains some redundancy in describing the updated map.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several paraphrase loops weaken density: "songs meant for ears long gone"/"unheard symphonies" and repeated whale song descriptions. Template cadence appears in "She'd come here... She traced... She picked up" sequence. Information density could be higher in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied syntax and selective detail, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("hushed thunder," "defiant moon") and one instance of mixed metaphor ("walls bled crimson"). The closing image lands cleanly despite these frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose generally maintains clarity and momentum, though some metaphorical language feels forced ("echo of a con artist's honest child"). The ink pot descriptions effectively track emotional beats through color changes. Minor redundancies appear ("waited actively—not passively, but alert"), and the final paragraph's summative quality weakens impact.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.9)
    Repetitive phrasing patterns emerge ("She was here to...", "Althea was not just...") and abstract descriptors proliferate ("quiet energy," "magical glow"). The prose achieves moments of precision but relies heavily on telling through labels like "earnestly studious" and "incandescent restraint" rather than embodied demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some figurative density in non-peak moments ("containers loomed like steel mountains...clawed at the bruised sky"). Minor template cadence appears in "Kael's mind reeled. The fragments he'd collected...They were clues" sequence. Information density stays high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong moments ("dust motes swirled in the slanting light of a dying sun") but suffers from occasional abstraction and mild overwriting. Several metaphors feel strained ("fossilized question," "memory trying to reform"). Information density is generally good, though some passages loop conceptually (the explanation of what the shell does appears multiple times in slightly different forms).

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, though some scaffolding appears ("Over the next week," "For a moment"). Information density is solid—most sentences advance multiple elements. Minor template cadence in middle section ("She'd spent years...She'd begun...") but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("the dawning hush, that fleeting moment when the moon's cold silence softened") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She'd come here," "She'd prove it," "she'd smile"). Some passages edge toward purple ("dawnlit melancholy lingered—a quiet, persistent truth") and the recurring "She'd [verb]" pattern creates monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum through the repair sequence. Several instances of explanatory scaffolding ("She'd initially scoffed, but now she relied on the method") and some purple touches ("mist clung...like a second skin"). The "somewhere, a ship sailed on" construction in the final paragraph feels artificially elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.9)
    Strong moments like "Clara didn't turn" and "his version of solidarity" show efficient characterization. However, several abstractions weaken line-level craft: "knowing" as undefined concept, "collision of forces," and the vague "Years later" transition that compresses without detail. The phrase "somewhere, a falcon laughed" anthropomorphizes oddly. Information density varies—the discovery scene builds well, but the epilogue-style ending summarizes rather than dramatizes Clara's transformed practice.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery. Information density is generally high, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("Now, the archway was a skeleton, its purpose erased by time" could be compressed). The "wild hush" motif bookends effectively, and technical clarity remains strong throughout despite the lyrical mode.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, but several abstract phrases weaken precision: "lonesome splendor," "harnessing the ephemeral," "collective grief." Some redundancy in explaining the temple's purpose twice. The metaphor "whispers coiled like eels" works well, but "mirror" for the hush feels less grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.5)
    Strong moments of imagistic precision ("The prison, perched off a jagged reef, was a skeleton of stone and regret"). However, abstract phrases proliferate: "sustained impossibilities," "thread a labyrinth," "copperlight repose" appear without concrete grounding. Template structures emerge in the ghost encounter ("The ghost laughed, a sound like shattering glass"). The piece achieves atmospheric density but sacrifices clarity, particularly around the hovering mechanics and the bodies reference.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong atmospheric prose with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery. Information density high in opening paragraph. Deductions for synonym loops ("centuries"/"centuries ago"), some filter constructions ("believed the gifts to be"), and occasional overwriting in metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good sentence variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("ghost of hope," "memories, perhaps"), some abstract phrasing ("devotion through endurance"), and minor redundancy in describing the weaving process.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Some figurative density in places ("roots twisting like serpents," "pulsed like a heartbeat") without becoming purple. Deduction for occasional abstraction ("faith...as a thread") and slight repetitive phrasing around roots/trees that dulls momentum in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves clarity with occasional elevation ("dawn's first light," "honeyed streaks"). Some repetitive structures appear ("Lira knelt," "Lira frowned," "Lira hurried"). Information density varies—the opening's rich description contrasts with more functional middle passages. The hologram section contains slight paraphrase loops ("if you're watching this" followed by explanatory summary).

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows strong moments ("needles darted like comets") but suffers from repetitive constructions and abstract declarations. Template phrases appear ("Zara nodded," "Jaxon frowned," "she said softly"). The ending's explicit theme statements ("The truth...is never what it seems") and "echoed silence of revelation" feel heavy-handed rather than earned through image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, several paraphrase loops diminish momentum: "unsent letters trapped in the space between worlds, letters that lingered like ghosts" and the redundant explanation of healing. Some figurative language edges toward purple prose ("keening songs of spirits who'd long since forgotten their names").

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction ("atrium's twilight," "alchemy") occasionally slows momentum. Clear propulsion through varied sentence structures, though a few abstract phrases ("bridges gaps," "frayed metaphors") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands—"fog clung to her like a second skin," "silence had seeped into her bones"—though occasional elevation risks purple prose ("reckless, giddy hope"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, as when "The orchard's silence had seeped into her bones, turning her art into quiet elegies." Minor repetition of "fog" and "light" stays purposeful given thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, especially in accumulative passages like "The mural's dancers began to dissolve, replaced by a single figure." Some phrases edge toward overwriting ("pigments mixed from crushed minerals and dreams") without pattern-teaching. Information density remains high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching ("snap-jaws glinting," "steam rising," "chaos converged"). Template cadence emerges in the greenhouse description sequence. However, the final image of Elias sipping coffee while watching moths effectively compresses denouement, and technical terminology (lepidopterist, pheromones, Fibonacci) reads accurately.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Her room was a cavern within the shell, lined with moss that glowed like captured starlight"). Some elevated diction ("ensconced," "caprice") fits the poetic narrator. Minor repetition of "centuries" could be varied, but overall momentum and clarity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density serves the accumulative design, though some passages edge toward overwriting—"cascade of opalescent static" could be simpler. Strong propulsion in key beats like "She mounted the repaired chime (for it was repaired, though not as it had been)" but occasional template phrasing weakens momentum ("Lirael nodded, though her chest tightened").

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Strong moments like "The archive's curator, a wizened man named Henrik, had scoffed" show efficient characterization. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "symphonies of truth" metaphor strains, and phrases like "her heart a river finally unblocked" echo the translated letter too directly. Some repetitive structures in the interconnected promises paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("dappled resolve shimmering like volcanic glass") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Information density is moderate; several passages restate rather than advance (the adhesive holding "urgency, fear, hope" repeats the encryption concept).

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("dust motes swirled in the sunlight like tiny galaxies") but suffers from paraphrase loops ("Balance, he'd learned, came from observing chaos" followed by extended examples repeating the same concept). The filter-heavy construction "Elias's chest tightened" and "Elias reached for a pen" dulls immediacy in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "The prisms above shifted, and for a moment, the terrace aligned with the horizon," though some passages lean heavily on abstract constructions ("necessary distances—the spaces between safety and the unknown"). Minor redundancy appears in explaining concepts already shown through action, and "featherly determined" creates an awkward neologism.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, particularly in describing the bioluminescent display. However, several instances of abstract philosophizing dilute momentum: "belonging was not about fitting into a preconceived mold but about finding one's place." The phrase "shadowseam wonder" appears forced rather than organic. Some repetitive structures emerge in the reflection passages.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("light fractured into prismatic whispers") but suffers from repetitive structures. Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. The paraphrase loop "Why?" she whispered.../"But why?" she repeated adds little pressure. Information density is moderate—many sentences do single duty describing without advancing conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence rhythm and selective detail. Strong opening image and satisfying closure with the arcade pulsing on. Some overwriting appears ("jagged collision of folk tunes and jazz riffs") and occasional abstract phrasing ("orchestrate serendipity") but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("moss that pulsed like a second heartbeat") but suffers from overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern or payoff. Template structures appear ("She began to write... She had done it... She stood..."). The phrase "obsidian grace" repeats without evolution, and abstract descriptors like "celestial cloak" and "cosmic verse" lack textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation and strong sensory specificity ("cold biting her ankles," "breath visible in the mist"). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or character state. Deductions for repetitive "She [verb]" openings across five consecutive paragraphs mid-story (-0.4) and some redundancy between "illuminate value in the mundane" stated twice with minimal variation (-0.2).

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful repetition ("slow and deliberate" echoes effectively). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("choreographed by some unseen hand") and one instance of abstraction ("translate pain into a universal language") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in describing the grotto's responsive atmosphere. Some figurative density in the opening ("saltwater pooled like liquid mercury") and middle sections approaches overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("equations for hope," "vectors") and slight repetition of "trial balloon" concept without varied language.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density high in discoveries: "brittle paper, melted wax, the jagged edge of a copper locket." Some metaphorical density in opening ("curved like a question mark," "spine of a forgotten map") serves accumulative design. Minor template cadence in "She'd come... She carried... She stopped" sequence and slight overwriting in "ancient and alive."

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Some figurative density in places ("embedded coded lullabies within the melody") but serves the accumulative design. Minor repetition of "coded lullabies" (3x) and some filter constructions ("Lirael smiled," "she knew") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in passages like "Each mark was a testament to the fragile line between peace and ruin." Some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("shadow stretching across the terrace like a bridge between enmity and hope") but generally serves the accumulative mode. Minor redundancy appears in repeated "price of redemption" formulations.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("The egg's shell was iridescent, a ghostly blue that shimmered like a mirage") but suffers from repetitive "He'd [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs. Some paraphrase loops appear ("The egg's fate didn't matter. What mattered was..."). Information density is strong in descriptive passages but thins during summary sections about his reputation.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong rhythm and imagery but suffers from overwriting in peak beats. Mixed metaphors appear ("unravel the very air," "body a living archive") and figurative density overwhelms some passages. Template phrasing emerges in "She reached out, and one orb drifted into her palm" and the final paragraph's somewhat predictable cadence diminishes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages ("The decommissioned radar dome loomed like a rusted crown"). Information density is generally high, though some passages contain mild redundancy (the puppet show description could be tighter). No significant loops or scaffolding detected, but occasional abstract declarations ("ethical storytelling isn't about hiding the dark") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting issues: elevated diction clashes with intimate moments ("verdant grotto," "iridescent," "hymn"), creating register drift throughout. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the moth's death ("died mid-flight"/"life ending not with a bang but a whisper"/"How often did such deaths occur"). The prose prioritizes poetic effect over momentum, with density of figurative language in most sentences without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    Lines often do multiple jobs, as in "The vendor had shrugged, 'Trash from the old quarter. Worthless.'" which establishes setting, conflict, and irony. Some overwriting appears ("glowed faintly, as if remembering sunlight") and occasional template phrasing ("Kael sat back, his hands raw but steady"). The prose maintains momentum but includes some figurative excess that doesn't always serve pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff ("vine-draped," "rewilded," "living tapestry," "river eroding banks" in rapid succession). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She'd always believed...but now she saw"). The epilogue contains multiple paraphrase loops restating the path/walker concept. Information density is compromised by conceptual redundancy, though some images like "raindrops clung to her lashes like diamonds" land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Strong opening and closing lines. However, several instances of telling over showing ("The irony wasn't lost on her"), some abstract phrasing ("infinitely patient, like a star waiting for its orbit"), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.4)
    Template cadence appears in visitor sequences ("She stared... she asked... she reached out"). Multiple paraphrase loops dilute momentum: "letting go was not weakness, but strength" echoes the same concept as "release was possible." Filter verbs accumulate ("she felt," "she knew," "she hoped"). The prose is functional but lacks the density and propulsion needed for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with purposeful repetition of frost/shimmer/glass imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional elevated diction ("testament to time's indifference") and slight redundancy in describing the synchronized work.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting issues: mixed metaphors ("deciduous vows" concept strains logic), repetitive phrasing about mending/persistence, and abstract constructions that slow momentum. Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the theme of persistence. The phrase "forgotten bag contents" repeats mechanically. Some lovely individual images but density of figurative language overwhelms clarity in places.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves clarity with selective vivid moments ("blossoms whispering," "waterfall of liquid light") but suffers from occasional filter verb stacks and abstract telling ("driven by a hunger to understand"). The template cadence of "She'd [verb]" appears multiple times, and some metaphors feel slightly strained ("threads," "fractal of possibilities").

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows competent variety but suffers from overwriting in places - "unheard symphony of whispers from books that shifted when unwatched" piles on modifiers. The final paragraph contains abstract proclamations ("dance of ignorance and discovery") that replace concrete resolution. Some effective moments like "voice like rustling parchment" demonstrate capability.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Deductions for template cadence in descriptive passages ("She saw...She'd found...She'd pieced") and some overwriting in figurative language ("living contradiction, a symbiosis of chaos and order"). Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks that track discovery beats. Some figurative language feels forced ("groaned like a ghost's whisper," "shadows elongated") and the phrase "her heart pounding" represents stock emotional shorthand. Information density remains high, with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "The bloom materialized. It hovered above the spiral" could be one sentence; "The caves would sing again, but now, they would know the weight of silence too" restates the prior paragraph's resolution. Some filter constructions ("she sought," "she'd learned") could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though several template-cadence runs appear ("She saw...She showed...She spoke"). Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("threads to follow—constellations to track, shards to piece together" conflates three vehicles), and some passages lean toward purple prose without clear POV justification.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("fog condense into pearl-like droplets") and rhythm variation. However, repetitive structures appear ("She + verb" opens multiple paragraphs) and some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("participating" followed by "part of that life"). The "sculpt identity from experience" phrase recurs without sufficient evolution. Information density is moderate; several passages could compress without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("tapestry of color," "living embers," "velvet void" in quick succession). The repetition of "chants" works as pattern but some metaphors strain ("hopelessness is a gravity").

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "transition periods" (used 3 times) and "pause" (7 times). Some sentences carry multiple jobs effectively, like the opening's world-building plus atmosphere. Filter constructions like "she realized" and "she wondered" accumulate unnecessarily, dulling immediacy in places.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=6.8)
    Template cadence appears in "She'd learned to... She'd heard the warning... She pushed through..." sequence. Metaphor coherence wobbles with "sprout wings of patience" mixing botanical/avian vehicles. Information density generally strong, though "intangibly tangible" and some philosophical abstractions ("stretching contracted possibilities") create mild opacity. The prose artifacts don't touch closure directly.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong sensory density and varied syntax, but several overwrought phrases reduce clarity ("catalyze a solution," "fluidly logical"). The piece avoids loops and maintains momentum, though abstract declarations like "she'd learned to dance with it" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages ("The orchard beyond was a cathedral of shadows, its trees bending in patterns that mirrored constellations long forgotten"). Some metaphoric density in high-pressure beats ("Fear was a luxury she couldn't afford") and occasional template phrasing ("breath hitched," "ground trembled") prevent higher scoring, though no major artifacts obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from occasional abstraction and repetitive phrasing around "threshold" and "sanctuary." Information density is moderate—some passages do double work while others feel ornamental. Template cadence appears in "She had [verb]" constructions. The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece, though middle sections sometimes favor atmosphere over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments ("The farm's owner, Dr. Voss, had hired her to monitor the 'conceptual pressure' in the air") but suffers from occasional abstraction and some repetitive phrasing around "pressure" and "diamonds." The opening paragraph attempts density but creates slight opacity with multiple concept introductions.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose demonstrates strong moments of clarity and momentum, particularly in the gramophone sequence. However, several issues accumulate: redundant phrasing ("hidden truth" appears twice, "golden shadows" repeats), abstract constructions ("bridge of intuition," "veil of ignorance"), and some overwritten passages that slow momentum. The opening paragraph contains three complex clauses that could be streamlined, and filter constructions like "she realized" and "she swore she saw" dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("strings snapping taut," "heat haze over summer pave") but occasional overwriting in figurative density ("captive stars," "shivering bliss," "ghostly breeze" cluster densely). Some abstract telling ("Reality shifted") could be more concrete, and the final inscription reads slightly too tidy, though momentum generally holds.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from paraphrase loops (multiple restatements about forgotten children) and abstract scaffolding. Template cadence appears in "He imagined... He imagined... And then he imagined" sequence. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("silent tombs," "labyrinth of half-truths") without pattern-teaching dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing plot or atmosphere. However, some template phrasing appears ("burst into," "shower of sparks") and filter verbs cluster in action sequences. The opening and closing images connect effectively through the lagoon's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density varies—strong in sensory passages but diluted by redundant phrases like "eerie nostalgia" appearing multiple times and the paraphrase loop of "some truths were meant to stay hidden, at least for now" restating the same concept. The "ghost's whisper"/"quietly vivid" cluster in paragraph one creates figurative congestion, though the saxophone-playing sequences maintain good propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic variety and information density, with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Particularly effective: "Her hands, calloused from decades of sorting grains and seeds by weight, color, and origin, knew the rhythm of the floating island's heart." Some minor repetitive phrasing around "she knew" in the final paragraphs. Opening and closing lines effectively bracket the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during action. Information density is adequate with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "ashes" metaphor, some filter-verb clustering ("he realized," "he thought"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("ghost of fertilizer and neglect").

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("its light seeping into the molten metal like ink into water") but suffers from occasional overwriting and mixed metaphors. "Factually mystical" creates conceptual confusion, and phrases like "a expression both luminous and sad" contain basic errors. Some filter constructions ("Kael wondered," "he felt the truth") dull immediacy in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variety and atmospheric density, with effective shorter sentences during tension ("Lira hesitated"). Information density is generally high, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("modestly fearless, a quiet resolve"). The "luminous ache" phrase works but edges toward purple prose. Clean grammar and punctuation throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong sensory density and rhythm variation, though figurative language occasionally overwhelms ("shadows shifted like liquid," "halo of forgiveness"). The phrase "mathematics of mercy" appears four times, creating mild redundancy. Information density remains high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Information density high in passages like the ink's effects. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("between childhood and now" repeated without concrete anchor) and some filter constructions that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures, though some figurative language verges on overwriting ("shadows stretch like old, thin hands"). Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Notable scaffold appears in adjacent metaphors for the ghosts ("weightless burden," "second skin") and some filter constructions ("Elias could feel them"). The "flickering like a heartbeat" simile in the closing strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose clarity suffers from density without precision—phrases like "negotiable reality" and "fractured versions of themselves" accumulate without sharp specificity. Some metaphors strain ("swirling sea of clouds," "cathedral-like aisles") and the text loops conceptually around rupture/awakening without varied articulation. The final third maintains momentum despite these frictions.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("time had only recently become visible as a shimmering cobalt haze") but occasionally tips into purple territory. Some metaphor density in non-peak beats ("burnished with sorrow," "seed of doubt, a fungus of revolution") without clear pattern-teaching. Information density generally high with purposeful imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with phrases like "ghosts of forgotten harmonies" and concrete tool descriptions. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("mending what isn't torn" concept restated multiple ways) and some metaphors strain clarity ("air thickening into a syrup of sound").

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "shadows stretching like ancient fingers," though several filter-verb clusters appear in high-pressure beats ("Lira felt a prickle," "she felt the expedition's fear"). Some explanatory redundancy in the lagoon discovery sequence slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("fractured timelines," "scaffold complexity") and repetitive structures. Template phrases like "She'd scaffold the island's secrets with her art, one sculpture, one slide, one alliance at a time" and overuse of triadic patterns reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high without overwriting. Some mild template patterns in the middle section ("She noticed how," "Mara found," "She'd started") but momentum remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("obsidian water reflecting her face like a distorted mirror") but suffers from filter-verb clusters ("she saw it," "she also saw") and some template phrasing. The tunnel sequence maintains momentum despite occasional redundancy in description.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the transformation sequence. However, several instances of telling rather than showing ("His motivation burned fierce," "tears mixing with the salt spray") and some overwriting in descriptive passages ("hues of amber and violet"). The phrase "not a resurrection, but a reimagining" effectively crystallizes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong sensory detail. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some overwriting appears ("bruise-purple twilight," "defiant green thumbprint") and mild redundancy in explaining the prophecy's meaning. The Chinese character "皱纹" breaks immersion unnecessarily.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("leaves unfurling like green flames") but suffers from density issues - figurative language appears in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching. Some redundancy exists ("The vortex inheritance was a dance... To decrease entropy, Lirael had to introduce disorder"). Template cadence appears in the "She saw... She could hear..." sequence during the vortex journey.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror action beats. Strong specific verbs ("pried," "churned," "agitating") and concrete nouns avoid overwriting. Minor issues include the clichéd "howled like lost souls" and slight repetition in "listening, always listening," but information density remains high and no significant loops appear.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("shooting stars streaked like tears from the heavens") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "stillness" and "hush" that becomes loop-like. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She believed... She carried... She reached"). Information density varies; some passages advance atmosphere without plot momentum. The final paragraph's explicit theme summary dulls impact (-0.5).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("tangled covenant between the land and its forgotten keepers"), some filter-verb clustering ("he saw," "he felt," "he understood"), and occasional overwriting in the metaphysical descriptions that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("emerald silo stood like a sentinel") but suffers from density issues—abstract concepts pile up without breathing room. Template cadence appears in the cataloguing sequence ("The coil became...The mercury was...The urn fragment?"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "timelessness wasn't an absence of time—it was a layering" followed immediately by similar abstraction about the architect's intent.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("silver veins of falling droplets") but suffers from abstract philosophical passages ("beauty was not a fixed state but a process") that tell rather than show. Some paraphrase loops appear ("harmonize the world's discord" echoes across multiple variations) though line-level clarity remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Several paraphrase loops appear ("gentle and systematic" echoed without variation, repeated "brazen calm"). Template cadence in middle sections ("She unspooled... She wound... She recalled") creates mild drag, though the closing sequence regains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation and selective detail. "The bronze quiet lingered" and "somewhere in the distance, a door creaked open" provide excellent closure cadence. Minor figurative excess in "dying star" glow and "liquid mercury" eyes that slightly clutters peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good - most lines advance multiple story elements. Some overwriting appears ("tiny, pale roots," "sharp and insistent") and metaphorical density occasionally peaks high ("The earth remembers" following extensive garden metaphor). Template cadence emerges briefly ("He reached... He tilted... He reached") but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.3)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "Hush's nose twitched"/"her nose twitching"/"her nose following"/"her nose still twitching" creates repetitive texture. Mixed metaphors ("wild hush" as both wasteland descriptor and sound quality) and some template phrasing ("The settlement was," "The leaf had been," "The next cylinder held") reduce propulsion, though key images like "grooves humming with forgotten melodies" land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the apparition sequence where short, fragmented sentences convey Elio's disorientation. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some overwriting appears ("blessed pariah," "gilded compass rose applique") and occasional abstract phrasing ("adriftness was a kind of freedom") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum through the heist sequence. Information density is solid with most lines advancing plot or atmosphere. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("cold, otherworldly light," "sacredly playful") and some template fantasy phrasing. The "guardian of wonder" repetition and philosophical ending weaken line-level impact.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of striking clarity ("crisis actor named Elara paced in a pattern that spelled *unbind*") but occasionally loops concepts ("benevolently ruthless" appears twice without evolution). Some passages edge toward purple ("liminal period...when the museum's rules frayed like old lace") without always earning the elevation through specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("her mercury skin substituted reality, unraveling her dreams") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("labyrinthine bookstore occupying the entire mountain") and abstract phrasing. The cavern sequence contains logical leaps (stones becoming feathers) that strain clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("threads pulsed like living veins," "soft as a whisper") and occasional redundancy ("eerie stillness," then "silence pressed in"). The "fidgeted productively" phrase feels forced. Information density is good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("bruised sky," "canyon's throat"). Information density is generally strong. Minor template cadence in the resolution sequence ("The elders screamed... but the villagers... stood rapt") and some filter constructions ("he realized," "he believed") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The acid sea lapped at the workshop's copper hull, its fumes eating the air like a thief") but some paraphrase loops ("Between breaths" repeated three times) and filter-verb clusters ("She'd seen," "she felt," "she saw"). Information density is good but occasional redundancy ("time blurred by the acid's stench and the statue's silent judgment") prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm, though some phrases feel overwrought ("accusatory light," "symphony of silence" implied but not stated). Several template constructions appear: "He'd kept it...He'd promised himself...He'd been drawn." Information density is moderate with some redundancy around the shell's significance.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose rhythm varies effectively between long atmospheric sentences and short declaratives ("Elara froze"). Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. However, some figurative density in descriptive passages ("bruised sky," "ghost of a storm") and occasional template constructions ("She'd learned to," "She imagined") create minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic control, particularly in the building sequence. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("tide dragging pebbles," "silver sliver") that occasionally obscures clarity. The repeated "geography of loss" phrase borders on becoming a loop, and filter constructions ("she felt," "she knew") occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of overwriting appear ("chandelier of green," "methodical grace") without pattern-teaching. Some paraphrase loops exist ("The truth had become dangerous, a commodity to be hoarded or destroyed" followed by similar restatements) that reduce momentum without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("bruise-purple sky," "gold halo that frayed at the edges"). Some overwriting in metaphors ("brittle as moth wings," "rasp like sandpaper") creates slight density issues. The abstract handling of memory return mechanism prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong specific verbs. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("frozen tears," "ghostly figures") and the abstract final metaphor. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and evocative imagery ("fireflies...drifted upward, their glow soft and erratic, guiding her like tiny lanterns"). Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("lacy menace") and the redundant "genuine thing" after "rare," but momentum remains strong throughout with no significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good—most lines advance multiple story elements. Deductions for repetitive "she'd been trying" construction, some filter verbs ("she realized"), and the slightly overwrought "thousand crickets waking" simile that doesn't quite land.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing atmosphere or reflection. Deductions for abstract emotional labeling ("jaded wonder," "feral nostalgia clawed at my ribs"), some filter-verb clustering ("I realized," "I wondered," "I hated"), and the final paragraph's shift to more abstract diction that dulls the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is solid—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or discovery. However, paraphrase loops appear ("reading between lines" / "interpreting clients' unspoken emotions"), and the final paragraph's abstract summary ("threads in a tapestry of resilience") creates momentum drag at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, though some redundancy appears ("shed meant more than casting off skin; it meant unraveling"). Template cadence emerges in places ("He walked... He breathed..."). The metaphorical density occasionally obscures concrete action, particularly in the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments like "gossip-column exorcist" and "the archive's dust smelled of regret." Some overwriting appears ("the hush before the orchard's trees were cut down, a silence so thick it seemed to vibrate"). Minor redundancy in explaining the copper-electricity-music connection weakens momentum in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from abstract philosophizing that reduces momentum: "The Witness's path was not linear" followed by description rather than dramatized wandering. Overwriting appears in stacked metaphors ("swirling vortex of light and darkness, chaos and order entwined in a dance as old as time"). The "resounding hush" repetition works as pattern but becomes mechanical. Information density drops when abstract concepts replace concrete action, particularly in the middle sections describing the journey.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose maintains atmospheric density with varied rhythm and strong sensory detail. Some figurative density in places ("the water's surface rippled, not with waves but with… lines?") and minor register elevation, but generally clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("The quiet wildfire of change had ignited") and some filter-verb clustering ("Kael saw," "he frowned," "Kael hesitated"). The metaphorical density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in describing the barrier's emotional states.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean, propulsive prose with varied sentence structures and strong rhythm control—"The rain tapped a Morse code rhythm against the glass" exemplifies the precision throughout. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (atmosphere, character, theme). No significant loops or scaffolding, though occasional elevated diction ("traverse") slightly strains in context.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and information density, particularly in scene-setting. Minor template cadence appears in the call sequences ("The next call was...By midnight"), and "melodically haunted" feels forced, but line-level control generally supports the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("flowers closing as if in prayer") with good rhythm variation. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor redundancies appear in the reflection passages ("The covenant would hold, she thought" follows similar earlier assertions), and some abstract phrasing ("haunted euphoria") could be more embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid moments like "boots squelched in mud" and "shadows that danced like dervishes." Some overwriting appears ("pulsed like a second heartbeat," "sharp as glass shards") but doesn't obscure key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good sensory density and momentum. Some overwriting in phrases like "pause of shifting constellations" and "time pooled like mercury." The metaphor mixing of time as both pausing and pooling creates slight incoherence. Strong information density overall.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several template patterns emerge: "Elias [verb]" repetitions, abstract descriptors ("strange comfort," "contingent relationships") that could be more concrete. The metaphor "History isn't a line. It's a web" lands well, but some sentences feel scaffolded ("Maybe, he thought, editing history wasn't about..."). Information density is moderate with occasional redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("waves whispering secrets," "symphony of stillness," "violin weeping and laughing") that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies. The phrase "joyful sorrow" appears explicitly, creating a thematic echo penalty. Several instances of telling over showing ("quietly charismatic presence," "drawn by curiosity") weaken immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty—"where flames had licked away the artist's face"—but occasionally overreaches with abstraction. Information density is generally strong though phrases like "unspoken stories" and "alive, pulsing in the walls" trend toward the generic. The final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates moments of genuine beauty ("edges blurred into velvet silence") and strong rhythm control. However, several issues accumulate: abstract phrases like "breathe life into a shared dream" lack specificity, some metaphors strain ("sea of sound waves"), and the POV shift creates fundamental confusion about narrative stance.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose generally maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful short sentences during tension ("A click. The container's door swung open"). However, several template constructions appear ("Elias picked it up," "Elias smiled," "Elias descended") and the phrase "whispers travel farther than shouts" repeats without variation. The metaphor "map...felt less like a guide and more like a prayer" works but similar constructions accumulate.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.2)
    Line-level craft shows competence with varied sentence structure and selective detail, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("reflecting the bruised sky like a bruise on glass") and abstract phrasing ("the edge of a half-spoken secret"). Some passages lean toward purple prose without advancing pressure, particularly in describing the light patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong opening imagery and varied sentence structure. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "unspoken words" (appears 6 times), some abstraction ("fading spirit," "quiet rebellion"), and occasional overwriting ("iron filings that shimmered like starlight when the moon struck them just so"). The filter verb "Clara smiled" appears twice in quick succession.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with moments of strong imagery, but suffers from abstract telling in crucial beats ("strange, liberating calm," "combative tenderness of letting go"). Template phrases like "as long as she could remember" and repetitive "She [verb]" constructions in the final paragraphs diminish momentum, though no major clarity issues impede comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains clarity with purposeful repetition ("Now...Next...Finally") that mirrors the ritual's stages, and sentences vary between short declarations and flowing meditation. Some figurative language works well ("weathered to the color of old bone"), though occasional abstraction ("the remade hush of the farmhouse") and the final philosophical whisper reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose achieves moments of vivid imagery but suffers from paraphrase loops ("tremor of certainty" appears twice identically, "dissolution of boundaries"/"boundaries began to dissolve"). Abstract phrasing like "the sacred and the profane" and "something unnameable" weakens specificity in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("sunlight fractured through molten-glass orbs") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias's [noun]" appears 6 times) and some purple patches ("a thousand shades of green"). The moth speaking in "a chorus of wind chimes" strains credibility, and several filter constructions ("he'd long suspected," "Elias hesitated") dull immediacy in pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally propels with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story or atmosphere. Some redundancy appears ("powerfully gentle" used three times, "golden shadows" twice) and occasional overwriting ("raw and ancient," "symphony of contradictions") but no major loops or scaffolding that obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("rings of meteorite iron, pendants holding vials of stardust") with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several abstract metaphors lack concrete grounding ("time pooled like mercury"), and there's noticeable repetition of conceptual phrasing around grief/renewal that borders on loops. Some filter constructions ("He realized," "Elias imagined") dull immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments ("rain dripped like a thousand inverted hourglasses") but suffers from repetitive constructions in dialogue tags and some paraphrase loops ("She rewound the tape, its hiss filling the loft" followed by similar tape descriptions). Information density is good overall. The measuring metaphor occasionally strains ("multiplying paths") but maintains clarity. No major artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose achieves moments of vivid imagery ("Dust motes swirled in the slanting light") and rhythmic variation. However, repetitive constructions plague the text: "She had come... She had done it..." and filter-heavy passages like "she understood: the archive wasn't a tomb." The abstract final section about "messy, unpredictable glory" and "open arms" relies on conceptual telling rather than concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose occasionally suffers from abstract phrasing ("luminous with regret," "softly deliberate nature") and some filter-verb clustering ("she could feel its hunger"). The writing is competent but lacks the crystalline precision demanded at higher bands, with phrases like "shapeless wisp that whispered" relying on alliteration over specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("The mist curled around the workshop's rafters like a ghost's breath") but suffers from repetitive structures and occasional overwriting. Phrases like "quietly vivid" and "shimmering stillness" feel forced rather than organic. Some metaphors strain (drawer hinges as "hinge in time"), and several passages loop concepts without advancing pressure, particularly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades: "displaced miracle trapped between moments," "jagged line from collarbone to ribcage," "stagnant water." Template phrasing appears: "She'd come seeking...but," "She'd always believed...but." The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("She'd come seeking closure, but she'd found something better") rather than trusting the image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Several instances of elevated diction that feel writerly ("incubate an idea," "lattice of memories," "hushed thunder") and some filter verb clustering ("she sensed," "she could feel"). Information density is moderate but could be tighter in places.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong imagery like "iridescent tendrils weaving through stone columns" and varied syntax create momentum. Some figurative density in peak moments ("Stars streaked overhead, their trails forming constellations that spelled out his deepest fears") and the phrase "unspoken yet urgent" contains mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments like "sand beneath his feet dimmed, as if the dune itself held its breath" demonstrate control. However, abstract phrases proliferate: "cultivate sparks in the dark," "occasionally everywhere," "wave function." Some template cadence in "He dreamed of..." repetition. Line-level clarity occasionally yields to conceptual opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of vivid compression ("gears grew like leaves and pistons hissed like cicadas") but suffers from abstract drift ("rediscover the wild frontier of her mind," "primordial chaos"). Some purple passages strain clarity: "the forest's machinery had grown over centuries, a labyrinth of steam and steel that masked the raw, untamed world beneath." Information density varies; strongest in the transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery ("bruised twilight sky," "shoreline lullaby"). Information density is generally good with lines serving multiple purposes. However, several abstract formulations ("weight of a shoreline lullaby," "scent of salt and iron") could be more concretely grounded, and occasional elevated diction ("traversed," "vigilant") creates slight distance from immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for redundant phrasing ("silence was not a virtue but a contract" followed immediately by similar restatement), occasional purple patches, and the template-like "Days later" transition.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean and purposeful with strong imagery ("leather that had outlasted empires," "voice dissolving into static"). Information density is high—most sentences advance plot, atmosphere, or character simultaneously. Some repetitive structures appear ("Veyra had..." constructions) but don't significantly impede momentum. The opening and closing lines effectively frame the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades critical beats: "coral bleeding white, their skeletons exposed like bones in a graveyard" stacks metaphors unnecessarily, while abstract phrases like "currency of silence" and "bridge between worlds" obscure concrete action. Template cadence appears in the final section with repetitive "The [noun] was/were" constructions, and the paraphrase loop of disappearing/reappearing paths dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments ("daylight pooled like liquid gold") but suffers from occasional redundancy ("a storm, gathering" after "The rebellion wasn't dead"). Some filter constructions ("Lira hated it") and light scaffold in transitions ("As twilight deepened") limit the score.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is solid - most lines advance story or atmosphere. Deductions for scattered overwriting ("fire and ash" painting the sky), some filter verb clustering ("she'd felt," "she'd heard"), and occasional template phrasing in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between calm observation and traumatic flashback. Information density is moderate—most lines advance character or atmosphere. Some redundancy appears in the somatic marker explanations, and occasional elevated diction ("perched," "mossy walls") slightly exceeds necessity, but no major loops or scaffolding interfere with momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves solid clarity with purposeful figurative language ("lamplight flickering like a tired heartbeat"). Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or theme simultaneously. Some rhetorical questions create minor paraphrase loops ("Why do we cling to fragments?"/"Is this what's left of us?"), and occasional abstractions dilute immediacy, but line-level craft supports the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("fractal spirals," "resonant reconfiguration of meaning") and one instance of filter stacking in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose shows competent control with varied sentence structure and some evocative phrases ("Ice crystals bloomed beneath her touch, cracking like a whispered secret"). However, multiple template constructions appear ("She had always believed," "She didn't have long to wonder"), and abstract declarations like "the revolution began" replace concrete imagery at the closure moment where specificity matters most.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery, though several instances of abstract phrasing ("focused their struggle, turning survival into art," "a manifesto," "a revolution") could be more concretely grounded. The recurring syntactic pattern of philosophical observation followed by metaphorical restatement occasionally slows momentum, particularly in the middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong sensory integration and information density, particularly in the garden descriptions and spike vibrations creating visible patterns. Minor repetition in "the goddess" references and some scaffolding around "he realized" constructions, but prose accelerates effectively toward the crystalline final image.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose clarity is generally strong with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. However, multiple abstract metaphors cluster without advancing action ("black hole, swallowing truths," "dance in their gravity"), and there's register drift into philosophical abstraction that slows momentum. The final paragraph especially suffers from conceptual redundancy about truth as "compass."

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.1)
    Strong opening establishes voice and atmosphere efficiently: "In the laboratory of lost sounds, where the walls hummed with forgotten frequencies." Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. However, abstract phrases like "Time's folding in on itself" and "guilt etched into her bones" reduce specificity, and some exposition-heavy dialogue creates momentum drag in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some figurative density in peak moments ("vortex of light and shadow," "swirling like tiny dancers") without full payoff. The "somewhere beyond the mist" construction in the final paragraph feels slightly scaffolded.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sentence variety and rhythm generally support the contemplative tone, with effective variation in length and structure. Information density is moderate, with most lines advancing atmosphere or character state. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("He had renamed the world, one chipped stone at a time" restates the prior paragraph's content), and phrases like "warm coldness" and "gentle radical" feel forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong figurative control with purposeful density—"shadows pooled where they shouldn't," "air smelled of rust and regret." Some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("fractured timeline," "possibilities withered") but rhythm varies naturally and supports the dreamlike atmosphere. The prose achieves lyric coherence without sacrificing clarity at key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose shows moments of precision ("muscovite geode sliver," "willowglass hope") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. The italicized emphasis feels heavy-handed (*don't*, *unmasked*, *im*precise), and phrases like "fractally, somatically, undeniably real" strain for effect. Several filter constructions ("he'd sworn off," "he'd begun to trust") accumulate without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("The fossil wasn't just ancient; it pulsed with a factually mystical aura") but suffers from abstract scaffolding ("She was no longer just a map maker. She was a translator, a bridge"). Some template constructions appear ("She'd been... But after... Now, she mapped"). Information density varies - strong in fossil interaction scenes, thinner in conceptual passages.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("wooden beams groaning like ancient bones") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract patches. Several sentences could be compressed for momentum, and some figurative language feels decorative rather than essential ("her thoughts sharpened like flint").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (setting as emotional mirror, actions revealing character). Some overwriting appears in figurative density ("mist clinging...like a second skin," "silver hush," "fraying at the edges" clustered early) and occasional abstraction ("the way truth revealed itself in layers"), but momentum sustains through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from conceptual redundancy—multiple paragraphs restate the distilling/unraveling metaphor without advancement. Template phrasing appears ("He'd always been closely attentive," "Back then, he'd thought"). The yarn needle metaphor gets explained rather than dramatized, creating tell-heavy passages that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("horizon bled orange," "whisper of wind through barbed wire") but suffers from occasional overwriting in the vision sequence. Some template phrasing appears ("Mara realized," "Mara understood"). Information density is generally good with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in active sequences. However, several overwrought phrases appear ("quivering hush of the night amplified his resolve," "protected vulnerability hanging in the air like mist") that prioritize atmosphere over clarity. The ending's abstract philosophizing about the rosebush weakens line-level momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery and varied sentence structures. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or concept. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("She would document...She would write," "coexist/coexisted" repetition) and some abstract telling ("Her motivation was clear") replaces potential scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between reflection and action. Strong images like "petal-strewn crown" and "liquid light" enhance atmosphere. Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("the soft rustle of lotus leaves" in already quiet space) and some template phrasing around emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure. Several clichéd phrases weaken impact: "chest tight with relief," "hands trembled," "loyal beast." The metaphor "cosmos was a chessboard" arrives late without prior game-theory setup.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but multiple template constructions appear: "He'd come here to...," "He'd come too far to...," "He'd done it." The phrase "wistful rebellion in his heart" in the closure beat forces abstraction where concrete image would serve better. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("swallowing him whole," "clawed at his ribs") without pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with effective atmospheric moments, though some overwriting appears ("the quarry's silence felt heavier, the air thick with the scent of damp stone and something older, sharper"). Template cadence in the discovery sequence ("Voss knelt... Clara knelt") and slight metaphor strain ("like a vein of blood") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between investigation and discovery beats. Information density is good—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Minor issues include some synonym churn around the nail/copper nail and occasional overwriting ("sickly green," "anxious sentinels"). The filter verb cluster in paragraph 5 ("Clara's breath caught," "She grabbed") slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery ("threads of light," "kaleidoscope of colors"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some metaphors edge toward overwriting ("mountains rising like ancient sentinels") but don't obscure clarity. The transformation sequence maintains propulsion through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose is clean but suffers from abstraction loops—multiple variations on "paths circle back" without advancing pressure. Template phrasing appears ("For the first time in years," "He knew that tomorrow"). Information density is low; many sentences restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some evocative imagery. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("silver moth trapped in amber"), some filter-verb clustering ("Lirael recognized," "She'd spent," "Lirael believed"), and moments of elevated diction that create register drift. The hologram sequence maintains good momentum despite complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structures and some strong images. Several instances of telling over showing weaken momentum: "her heart lighter than it had been in years" and "the memory had been buried, erased by her own magic." Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("chest tightened," "breath steady"). The final paragraph contains unnecessary philosophical summary about "lost things worth keeping."

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some metaphorical density in early paragraphs ("cobalt glade," "root-bound visionary," "eclipsed covenant") risks overwhelming, but the language serves the accumulative texture rather than obscuring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("needle carved from a single bone," "thread spun from spider silk and moonlight") but suffers from abstract summaries ("trail of broken lives," "flawed whole") and some template phrasing. The keeper's dialogue occasionally scaffolds meaning that the scene should dramatize.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, particularly in discovery moments. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Some filter verb clusters appear ("he'd tell himself," "he thought," "he realized") but don't obscure momentum. The opening and closing lines create effective bookends.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose achieves clarity and maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is generally strong, with most lines advancing multiple story elements. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("transition is not destruction, it's reassembly" echoes similar content), and some passages rely on abstract terminology ("intangible laws of transition") without grounding specifics.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some ornamental phrases ("wintersun serenity," "titan-gear") and slight repetition in transformation descriptions. The line "Somewhere, a fish took flight" provides elegant compression, but occasional overwriting ("iridescent scales," "tangle of seaweed") doesn't always serve pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("stalactites that dripped like frozen tears") but suffers from abstract phrasing in crucial beats ("emotions: regret, longing, the ache of unspoken truths"). Several paraphrase loops appear ("The pearl's radiance wasn't just light—it was a bridge" followed by similar restatements), and some sentences rely on telling rather than embodied action during peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "ivy that clawed at the cracked brickwork like a thousand green fingers." Some redundancy appears ("festering" used twice, "methodical/meticulous" repetition) and occasional overwriting ("raw, unfiltered edge"), but momentum remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and action. Minor repetition appears ("propagation delays" used 3x, "confidence man's watch" 4x) and some abstract phrasing ("the weight of time itself") but momentum generally holds.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty: "strings shimmering as if threaded with liquid moonlight." Information density is high, with most sentences carrying multiple functions. However, some overwriting appears ("velvet observatory" repeated, "a thousand unspoken secrets" feels stock) and occasional register elevation ("fusing with the patterns") that doesn't quite match Lira's established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"adjusted her silver spectacles and studied the emerald chip" establishes character, action, and focus object. Some figurative density in peak beats ("mirror to the cosmos," "threads through a loom") without clear payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("She realized... She had to act fast").

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose flows well with varied sentence structure and clear momentum through most beats. However, abstract phrasing clusters in places ("vineyard hush of stillness," "liquid silver" pools) and the final paragraphs contain some conceptual redundancy about cycles and contentment. The "scalloping their edges" metaphor strains. Information density could be higher in the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "the world had turned to shades of gray—a fitting canvas for a conscience for hire." Some redundancy in explaining the cloak's effect ("stripping away the noise of certainty to reveal the quiet chaos beneath") after showing it. Template phrasing in "frowned," "nodded," "stepped closer" action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of elevated diction ("resonant tone that seemed to vibrate," "brilliant point") and mild redundancy in describing the withholding concept across multiple paragraphs. The "spider spinning a web from the breath of the wind" metaphor strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flows with generally strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, though some passages tend toward the abstract ("a force neither fully understood nor easily harnessed"). Minor repetition issues include multiple "Kael + verb" constructions. The opening and closing images bookend effectively, but middle sections occasionally lose propulsive momentum in favor of exposition about the canyon's history.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves clarity but contains several forced constructions ("brilliant dimness that revealed hidden paths") and repetitive phrasing around "mist walking." The filter verb "watching" in "watching as the liquid seeped" dulls immediacy at a key moment, though momentum generally sustains through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("grotesque smiles," "jagged shadows"). Information density high—most sentences advance atmosphere and meaning simultaneously. Minor template cadence in "He reached...As he opened...Elias watched" sequence but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("fingers traced the grooves"—physical action + emotional state + world-building). Strong rhythm variation supports the accumulative structure. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("Kael + verb" pattern in paragraphs 2-3) and the phrase "quietly enthusiastic" appearing twice identically.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts during the ritual sequence. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor issues include some elevated diction ("iridescent," "coalesced") and occasional redundancy in describing the echoes.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves clarity with selective metaphors like "bridge of frozen light" and "metronome for the viaduct's pulse," though some passages edge toward overwriting ("the rift—a jagged tear in the sky—seemed to stitch itself shut"). Minor template cadence appears in "He'd spent nights... He'd been told... He'd calculated" but doesn't pervade. Information density is generally strong with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.0)
    Vivid selective detail ("foundations like broken teeth," "sapphire-hued liqueur label, half-buried in moss") creates atmosphere without overwriting. Some template phrasing in transitions ("She knelt," "She reached," "Mara turned") and mild paraphrase loop with "spin stories into shared meaning" appearing twice. The final image of photographs "lighting the way" risks slight metaphor strain but maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful imagery. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for some overwriting in descriptive passages ("cascade's colors shifted like liquid stained glass, casting fractured light") and occasional redundancy ("hidden orchard" mentioned twice in similar contexts).

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple elements. However, some template cadence appears ("Kael stood," "Kael's fingers," "Kael leaned," "Kael knelt") and occasional overwriting surfaces ("nocturnal arbor above the clouds, where the boughs of ancient trees shimmered").

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose suffers from abstract language ("channeling energy through complementary opposites") and telling phrases ("his motivation burned like a wildfire"). Multiple filter constructions ("Kael felt the numbness retreating"). Template fantasy diction ("a sharp, feral thing," "smooth as oil") lacks freshness. The final paragraph's "alive in a way it hadn't been in years" exemplifies the telling-heavy approach.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose demonstrates strong sentence variety and rhythm, particularly in investigative sequences. Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. However, some redundancy appears ("The haven beside the quiet brook had always been a place of transformation. Now, it was something more") and occasional overwriting ("its wrinkled surface iridescent under the moonlight") without pattern-teaching or payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several instances of overwriting harm momentum: "macerated the air" appears three times, creating repetitive phrasing. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity ("leaf blower symphony conductor" conducting with a machine that "macerates" air). The prose reaches for literary effect but often lands in purple territory with phrases like "the whispers of joy that once filled the household above, now silenced by time" that could be more concise.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence lengths and strong imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor issues include occasional abstract phrasing ("interiorizing exteriors" technique) and slight repetition of mist/fog imagery, though these support the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structure and purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("ember nexus pulsed like a wounded heart," "frozen in twilight's embrace"). Information density is generally strong, with most lines advancing multiple purposes, but some metaphoric density in high-pressure moments ("light erupted," "reversed storm") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong imagery like "liquid light winding through the rocks." Minor overwriting in metaphors ("skeletal hand," "spectral fingers") and the final paragraph's thematic summary weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "starlight coalesced into a prism" and good momentum through varied syntax. Deductions for density issues: figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats ("wood warping into shapes that defied geometry," "strands of light," "fur glowing with the light of a thousand suns") without clear pattern-teaching. Some template cadence in the passenger resolution sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows purposeful rhythm variation and strong opening imagery. However, abstract phrasing proliferates ("texture of connection" appears 4 times, "rational enchantment" 3 times) creating conceptual loops. The final third suffers from repetitive reflection structures ("She'd come here to... but in the end, she'd found") that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows competently but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She began to explain," "She continued," "Lirael felt") and some template phrasing in emotional beats. The recurring "faint glow/light" becomes a verbal tic, and several sentences restate rather than advance ("teaching navigation...teaching her students").

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Strong images like "bruised violet" twilight and "heartbeat trapped in amber" elevate key moments. Some phrases edge toward overwriting ("midwife to grief," "frozen promises") but don't overwhelm. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves solid clarity with moments of strong imagery ("star trapped in amber," "etching the unremembered into the ocean's skin"). Information density generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("crashing hush" appears twice), some filter-verb clustering ("She remembered," "she noticed," "she realized"), and mild register drift in technical explanations that don't fully match Lira's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "heartbeat" and "error." Deductions for occasional overwriting ("frost-laced windows hummed with the ghost of starlight"), some filter verb clustering, and template cadence in middle sections ("He'd tried... He'd found... He'd carried").

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence structure and selective detail, with strong moments like "towers of bone rose like skeletal fingers." Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("sound was not music—it was mathematics") and occasional register elevation, but clarity remains intact. Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied syntax and purposeful imagery ("glass shiver," "oil on water"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("gravitationally playful" feels forced) and one template cadence run in the confession sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty—"peaches glowed like captured sunsets"—with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, some figurative density in peak beats ("cloud of iridescent dust that swirled into the air, settling on the statues like a curse") and occasional abstract phrasing ("gap between knowing and understanding") slightly impede momentum. The final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some repetitive phrasing appears ("Elias had," "He'd") and the phrase "brittle hush" recurs without evolution. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with the cobalt arcade image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows careful attention to rhythm and varied sentence structure, avoiding template cadence. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or action, though phrases like "testament to quietly persistent craftsmanship" feel slightly overwrought. No significant loops or scaffolding detected, and the figurative language remains coherent if occasionally precious. The line "Inside the chime of wind bells, time stretched, warping like old film" effectively merges setting with temporal distortion.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the transformation sequence. Information density is generally strong—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme simultaneously. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("stories weren't just words on a page but living things" echoes similar sentiments), and phrases like "sanely eccentric" repeat without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though density of figurative language ("bruise of twilight," "horizon bled gold," "liquid glow") occasionally overwhelms without pattern-teaching. Template phrasing appears in "She believed... She feared..." sequence. Strong opening/closing frame with "hush of improbable beginnings" creates structural resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly during the unlocking sequence. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "enigmatic locksmith" in the opening, abstract phrases like "woven into the very fabric of his being," and repetitive mystical descriptors. The final paragraph contains some scaffold phrasing ("ready to carry the weight of enveloped secrets") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("crusted with salt and seaweed," "ivory caps glowing faintly"), but some abstraction creeps in ("the quiet magic of places where the past and present collide"). Mild redundancy in the final paragraph's thematic articulation reduces momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some elevated diction ("reversible exile," "mentor resilience quietly") occasionally drifts from natural speech patterns. Minor redundancy in explaining the backwards-walking metaphor, but information density remains solid overall with lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful figurative language that serves the mythic tone. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("tapestry of whispers," "hush of budding hope"), and occasional overwrought metaphors ("pink tongues") distract without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("threads falling away like old skin") but suffers from abstraction loops around "hush" and "silence" without advancing meaning. The final third contains repetitive constructions ("She'd felt... She'd come... She'd never") that create template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, but several instances of elevated diction clash with immediacy: "methodology curious" appears twice, "resonant reconfiguration" feels academic. Template structures emerge in the tool-packing sequence ("a brass sextant, a vial of holy water...") and some paraphrase loops around the silence-as-language concept dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good information density and varied sentence structures. Minor issues include some abstract phrasing ("physics of letting go" repeated without evolution) and occasional overwriting ("dim glow of the forgotten sunken ship library"). The metaphorical language mostly serves the story but occasionally reaches for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions that blend setting with emotion. However, "driftingly alert" repetition, some filter-verb clusters ("Elias believed," "he knew"), and the hedging final paragraph ("maybe, just maybe") create minor momentum drags without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.3)
    Strong figurative language ("clouds thin into wisps," "trembling hands") creates atmosphere without overwhelming. Information density is high with most sentences advancing discovery or mood. However, abstract phrases like "frayed at the edges" and "beyond the veil" lack specificity, and the metaphor mixing of flame/ice/lens concepts occasionally muddles rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("brass telescope, its patina glowing like old coins") though occasionally overwrites ("quietly explosive alchemy"). Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing character or atmosphere. Minor repetition in sentence openings ("She adjusted... She stood... She aimed") creates mild template cadence that could vary more.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during discovery moments. Information density high in description of the painting process ("fractally precise spirals," "blending ultramarine and gold"). Some redundancy in final paragraph with "walked on" following established departure, and "heightened stillness" feels somewhat forced as a closing echo.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and strong momentum. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor repetition in "starlings screamed" but serves pattern. The final image lands with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("mend what was broken"/"even the most broken things could be made whole"). Template phrasing appears in transitions ("He'd spent weeks," "He'd traced"), and abstract declarations in the final paragraphs dilute the concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.7)
    The prose is clean but suffers from abstraction ("brambled hope was palpable") and repetitive constructions. Several passages tell rather than show ("Their conversations shifting from fear to action"). Information density is low, with multiple sentences restating similar content about cooperation and hope.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong imagery. However, several instances of elevated abstraction ("spectral glow," "fractal of fractals") and some repetitive phrasing around time/lullaby concepts. The "insects in amber" simile and nested patterns description risk overwriting but don't fully obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong moments like "labyrinth was a tangle of dead vines and fractured stone, its paths twisting like veins." Some repetitive phrasing appears ("Kael knelt" twice, multiple "Kael [verb]" constructions). Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs, though some scaffolding remains in transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. However, multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "separation wasn't an end, but a phase" followed immediately by restatement. Template cadence in "She'd assumed... but here" construction. The "As the pieces fell into place" phrase appears twice without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variations and selective detail. Information density remains high—"jars containing different absence: the silence before a scream"—without overwriting. Some abstract passages like "possibility pooled like water" risk opacity but the overall line-level control supports the conceptual nature.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong sensory specificity in "walls lined with shelves holding vials of liquid memory" and "brackish water, its surface etched with tidal formations," though some abstract phrasing like "emotionally contagious nature" and "weight of a decision made in haste" dulls immediacy. The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structure, but occasional filter constructions ("he'd discovered," "he knew") create minor distance.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose suffers from overwriting - "Under the hush of borrowed starlight" and similar purple phrases accumulate without earning their elevation. Multiple metaphor systems (musical, mechanical, agricultural, cosmic) compete rather than harmonize. Template phrases like "whose voice could...whose hands could" and repetitive "She + verb" constructions create mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("liquid mercury," "shattered constellations") and some template cadence in the middle section ("He lifted...He'd spent...He pressed").

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments like "her boots scraping the ceiling" during inversion, with varied sentence structures creating rhythm. However, multiple instances of telling over showing ("her mind racing," "her intuition humming") and redundant phrases ("trembling"/"racing heart" in proximity) reduce momentum. The abstract final paragraph ("latent blaze in her chest") lacks the concrete specificity of earlier passages.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control and information density in peak moments. However, template cadence appears ("She'd heard... She reached... She strummed") and some paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("The grove held its breath. Even the siskins paused"). Filter verbs cluster in emotional peaks ("She'd done it. She'd made").

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally clean with purposeful rhythm variations and strong opening/closing images. Information density good in descriptive passages. Some template cadence in middle section ("Alaric closed his eyes... He pressed his palm...") and minor filter verb clustering. The "hopeful melancholy" in the final line feels slightly forced rather than emergent.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("the air hummed with the static of unspoken things") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She believed...she intended," "She thought of...of the silences"). Template cadence appears in "She [verb]" openings across multiple paragraphs. Information density varies—some sentences do multiple jobs while others merely transit. The "path to empathy" phrase recycles verbatim, creating a paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with dense figurative language ("vines draped like ancient tapestries," "wildflower hush...hummed in her bones") that slows momentum. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("her ambition was rooted in patience"), and the "journalized" neologism feels forced. Information density is uneven—some paragraphs could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum through action. Some figurative density in places ("serpents," "liquid light," "whirling silence") without becoming purple. Deduction for occasional explanatory scaffolding ("She'd theorized...") and one paraphrase loop around the planet's name meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose generally flows well with varied sentence structures and strong momentum. However, several instances of telling rather than showing ("Her task was to survey," "Her motivation was personal") and some repetitive constructions ("Anya moved," "Anya climbed," "Anya descended") prevent higher scoring. The metaphor "puzzle box designed to outthink her" works but doesn't quite earn its conceptual weight.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, with high information density in descriptive passages. Some figurative density in peak moments ("frost spiraled like ghostly breath," "sculpted hush made flesh") risks over-ornamentation, and occasional template phrases ("reached out," "stepped inside") could be more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("needle through silk," "time pooled like liquid") but suffers from occasional overwriting. The phrase "avalanchingly quiet" repeats verbatim. Some metaphors strain: moths with wings "scattering ash" feels slightly forced. Information density is generally good, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves strong imagery with "halo fragment suspended...pulsed like a half-remembered heartbeat" and varied sentence structures. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("Emotions weren't variables; they were wildfires" followed by restatement), and filter verb clustering in the merger sequence ("He saw...felt...stumbled") reduces immediacy. The "lucid turbulence" phrase feels slightly forced as title-drop.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean, propulsive prose with varied sentence structures and strong sensory detail. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor repetition of "vibration/vibrated/vibrating" (5 instances) creates a slight echo, though this arguably serves the sympathetic resonance theme.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.7)
    Strong imagistic prose in places ("frozen lightning," "living archive") but hampered by filter verb clusters ("felt a creeping doubt," "realized, with a sickening lurch") and some redundancy ("cold, veined stone" then "cold seep into her skin"). The template progression in paragraph 4 ("She saw...She channeled...She stepped") creates rhythmic monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose has moments of strong imagery but suffers from template cadence in places ("Mara believed it. Every night, she pressed it..."). Some paraphrase loops appear ("The message wasn't for her. It was for them"). Mixed metaphor issue with silence being both "woven" and "bloomed" strains coherence. Filter verb clusters appear in emotional peaks.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery ("shadow stretching across the orchard like a skeletal hand"). Some redundancy appears ("quietly determined"/"quiet fire" and multiple shadow references). The expository middle section with Lira explaining the mines' purpose disrupts momentum. Filter verb "he knew" appears but doesn't overwhelm.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with strong moments ("Gravity reversed. Colors inverted.") and good syntactic variety. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("the truth was a knife that cut both ways") and occasional redundancy ("cyclically spontaneous" used twice). The "murmur of half-remembered dreams" bookend feels slightly forced.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in atmospheric passages. Some filter verb clusters ("he noticed," "he realized") and mild redundancy in describing the letters' arrival pattern create minor drag, but information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and plot simultaneously. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("liquid night," "electric" shadows) and one instance of telling that could be shown ("She'd always known her role was small").

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments but suffers from occasional overwriting ("quietly explosive," "iridescent caution") and metaphor density that borders on excessive. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the story-magnetism concept. Line-level craft is competent but inconsistent, with some passages achieving lyrical beauty while others feel overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The air hummed with the static of an approaching storm" sets atmosphere while marking time pressure. Some figurative density in peak moments ("celestial heartbeat," "labyrinth's soul") but imagery remains coherent and purposeful without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery, though several abstract loops appear ("forgotten songs," "scattered memories" repeat without deepening). The line "we remember how to live" provides effective closure despite some density issues in the middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves solid clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between reflection and scene. Some figurative language feels forced ("invitation's gold filigree...like a secret too heavy to announce") and occasional redundancy appears ("forgotten relic" followed by explaining locked doors), but the closing image lands cleanly without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("saplings pushed through cracks, their leaves unfurling like green flames") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Some redundancy appears in the ending paragraphs where similar ideas about seeing/noticing repeat without added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in technical passages about frequency sampling. Some repetitive constructions appear ("Elara's motivation was clear," "Elara's gently meticulous nature") and the phrase "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" repeats verbatim, creating minor loops that prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose shows strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high, with most lines advancing plot, character, or atmosphere simultaneously. However, "motley crew of smugglers, spies, and thieves" reads as stock phrasing, and some metaphors strain ("gnawed at barnacled pilings," "voice like shattered glass"). The opening and closing lines effectively bookend the piece with resonant imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong opening with "lavender bluff shimmered" and resonant closing with "the world held its breath." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("liquid light," "thousand moths") and occasional elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic") slightly above POV register, but prose remains clear and propulsive overall.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. However, several passages suffer from overwriting: "festered inside him like a wound" and "churning out portraits of strangers for coins, his fingers blackened with charcoal but his soul starved of color" pile on metaphors. Some redundancy appears in explaining the lock's significance across multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and evocative imagery ("toxic sky bled amber," "ink that shimmered like poisoned honey"). Information density is high without feeling rushed. Deductions for occasional overwrought moments ("maws snapping at her heels") and some filter constructions ("Elara's breath hitched").

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Some figurative density approaches overwriting ("rippled through the mist like liquid light," "painted symphonies of truth") without clear payoff. Minor redundancies appear ("whispering bluff" where wind interprets "secrets") and some abstract phrasing ("color of wonder") lacks concrete grounding, though these don't obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm variations and strong imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, some abstract phrasing ("fragmented wholeness," "strangely organic") appears without sufficient grounding, and occasional elevated diction ("inexorable drift") creates minor register inconsistency. The "like a song" simile in the final line, while resonant, edges toward sentiment.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Some overwriting appears ("vibrant mosaic of green and gold," "courtyard basked in dawn's glow") without earning the elevated register. Information density is adequate though several passages could be tightened. The final image lands effectively despite the coincidence strain.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm during key moments. Information density is good, with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("ghostly images...waltz, slow and deliberate") and some abstract phrasing ("vulnerability encrypted as strength") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting appears in descriptive passages ("jagged, luminous clusters," "otherworldly energy") without payoff. The phrase "gleaming silence" bookends effectively but several passages border on purple prose ("the silence so complete it hummed"). Information density could be higher in the middle exploration sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery. However, abstract phrases like "tranquil blaze" and "smoothed hush" repeat without gaining concrete meaning, creating a sense of mystical vagueness. The writing favors elevated diction over clarity in places, though no major technical errors or loops appear.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves high information density with evocative phrases like "wisteria vines curled around wrought-iron benches" doing multiple jobs. Sentence variety and rhythm support the mysterious atmosphere without overwriting. Minor weakness in the rushed final paragraph where "somewhere, deep in its walls" feels vague compared to the story's earlier precision, and "dust rained from the rafters" borders on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("shadows that pooled like ink") but suffers from overwriting in peak beats with mixed metaphors (memories as both "sparks" and "constellations"). Template cadence appears in "She'd always been... She'd spent her life... She'd archived" construction. The transformation sequence relies on abstract language ("resonance structures flared") that obscures concrete action, though line-level clarity generally holds.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The air hummed with the chill of millennia" establishes both atmosphere and temporal scope. Some figurative density in peak moments ("stalactites dripping like liquid time," "thick as velvet") and occasional abstract phrasing ("forgive the unfinished") create minor opacity without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty - "each note a thread in the webs of intrigue that tangled the valley." Some overwriting appears in dense metaphorical passages, and the phrase "memories, trapped in the stone" repeats verbatim. Information density remains high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong imagery and atmospheric control, particularly in transitions between dreams and the framing glacier scenes. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, several metaphors strain ("windows of connection," "borrowed starlight") and some phrases loop conceptually ("fragile things...fragile, enduring threads"). The syntactic pattern of "The [ordinal] dream..." creates mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or discovery. Some figurative density in places ("liquid silver," "drowsy fireflies," "road of liquid light") but serves the accumulative texture without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("miniature suns amid the rust-colored dust storms"). Template cadence in middle section ("She returned... She spread... She pocketed"). Information density is solid with most lines advancing multiple purposes. Final image effectively recharges earlier motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm and purposeful compression, with effective variation in sentence structure. Information density is high, particularly in descriptions of the storm and radio frequencies. Deducting for abstract patches ("civilization that had mastered the storm") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages that slow momentum without adding pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the sun's first blush, painting the room in a positively wistful gold"). Major deductions for the meta-textual interruptions, the explicit word count announcement "(Word count: 700.)", and the repetitive poetry drafting that creates a loop without advancing story. These artifacts severely compromise professional polish.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows competent rhythm variation and sensory specificity, but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("Elias's breath," "Elias knelt," "Elias smiled") and some overwriting in metaphorical density ("bleeding" horizon, "azure-coat" repeated). Template cadence appears in action sequences and abstract concepts like "logically emotional" lack concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Kael's task was," "Kael's fingers," "Kael smiled," "Kael nodded"). The "sculpting patience from impatience" phrase appears three times nearly verbatim, creating unnecessary loops that could be varied while maintaining thematic coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose generally propels with varied sentence structure and strong verbs: "The flame flared," "Mara gasped," "she slammed the file shut." Information density is solid with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "She'd use the lantern one last time" followed immediately by redundant explanation. Template phrasing appears in "She saw... She saw... And she saw" vision sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and dialogue. Information density could be higher—some descriptive passages do single duty. Template cadence appears briefly ("He thought of... The warden's program... And the clockwork heart") but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose density is high with most sentences advancing multiple purposes. Strong verbs and specific nouns dominate ("spirals that defied logic," "sulfurous winds"). Some scaffold appears in the algorithm theorizing section with near-duplicate concepts. The final sequence achieves excellent propulsion, though middle sections occasionally loop conceptually ("transliterate" appears 5 times with similar function).

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several issues accumulate. Template cadence appears in "Lira knew better. She'd seen the way..." structure. The metaphor "Across the echo of forgotten songs" feels forced and doesn't connect to the digital setting. Some overwriting in phrases like "the sensed absence of information gnawed at her" where simpler language would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the mirror sequence's parallel structure. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, abstract phrasing like "mapping empathy onto action" and "reconstitute the fragment's power" creates opacity. Some redundancy in explaining the storm as both "collective fear" and later needing empathy to quiet it.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Deductions for scattered overwriting ("keening sound, like wind through a cracked bell"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and occasional redundancy ("pale and shivering" followed immediately by "shivering").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts, particularly in descriptive passages like the opening. Some philosophical dialogue runs long without advancing action ("harmony isn't silence. It's the tension between notes"), and occasional filter constructions ("Elias recognized her") could be more immediate, but no major artifacts obstruct clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=4.8)
    Extensive repetition weakens momentum: "kinetic parapet" appears 7 times, "murmuring pavilion" 5 times, "whisperfield" 6 times. The final six paragraphs loop through variations of completion without advancing. Template phrasing pervades: "The prophet [verb], [result]" structure repeats.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose has moments of strong imagery but suffers from paraphrase loops ("The factory wasn't dying, she realized; it was evolving" restates the collaboration concept). Template cadence appears in "She reached...She flipped...She smiled." Abstract phrasing like "testament to resilience" and "scent of memory and possibility" dulls concrete impact.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstraction and telling over showing ("His mind raced through fractured sequences"). Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the pattern/growth concept repeated without advancement. The final three paragraphs contain redundant declarations of transformation. Some elegant moments ("like a second skin," "the library's bones") can't offset the overall explanatory mode.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though "He'd heard it once...but it had slipped away" appears twice conceptually. Strong opening and closing lines that mirror each other purposefully. Information density high in descriptions like "twisted metal forms within" doing atmosphere and constraint work. Minor template cadence in "He knelt...he took...he drew...he began."

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in high-pressure beats ("dervish," "silent hymn to transience") and mixed metaphors that muddle clarity. Template cadence appears in action sequences ("He worked feverishly... He ran to... He closed his eyes"). Information density is uneven, with some paragraphs highly compressed while others loop similar content.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum through varied sentence structures. Information density strong in moments like the vinyl playing sequence. Deductions for overwrought phrases ("alchemy of melody," "labyrinth of grief") and slight template cadence in "Mira nodded... Mira smiled... Mira straightened."

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows cleanly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor repetition in "She had spent months studying" followed by "She had a theory" creates slight drag. Strong opening and closing images bracket the piece effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and action. Information density is generally strong, with lines like "Its jagged edge had once cut her thumb, a reminder that even the unreal could bleed" doing multiple jobs. Minor redundancies appear ("crumbling stone"/"crumbling fountain") and some metaphors edge toward overwriting ("tapestry of memories").

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythmic variation, though some passages lean purple ("mist curled like smoke," "pulsed with a faint, reflectively vibrant glow"). Information density is decent but several sentences could tighten. The "Hours passed, or perhaps minutes" construction feels stock. Strong opening and closing lines.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of strong density: "The garden's heart was a chamber where rusted server racks cradled terrariums of bioluminescent moss." Some repetitive structures appear ("She'd spent years," "She'd noticed," "She'd been afraid") creating mild template cadence. Information density generally strong but occasional scaffolding phrases reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("time and truth tangled like kelp") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("ephemeral cameo appearances") and template phrasing ("Clara understood"). Information density is moderate; some passages could compress without loss. The recurring "swirling hush" and seashell imagery create effective rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose clarity and momentum generally succeed, with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops weaken density: "The arbor held its breath, then exhaled, a contented sigh" followed immediately by "Everything aligned, just as it should" restates satisfaction without advancement. Template phrases like "eyes bright," "sound like wind through wheat," and "tinkling bells" rely on stock imagery rather than specific invention.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery and varied sentence structure that supports the meditative pace. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or action. However, some redundancy appears in explaining the plate's significance across multiple paragraphs, and abstract phrases like "weight of possibility" lack concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, particularly in technical descriptions. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "The harvest of echoes" concept is explained multiple times, and filter constructions like "Elias discovered," "he realized," appear in clusters during key discovery beats.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative specificity—"calcified whispers," "whalebone reverie." However, some paraphrase loops appear: "boundary-lessly trapped limbo" followed by explanatory restatement, and "weights of different burdens/weights, not wounds" creates mild redundancy. The "fragmented but familiar" construction feels slightly templated.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("the color of dried blood and autumn leaves") and one instance of telling what's shown ("Clara smiled...and thought").

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows strong moments ("her calloused fingers sifting through the froth") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in descriptive passages. Some metaphors strain ("the sun hung like a stuck coin"). The final section maintains better momentum though "Some said she'd drowned. Others insisted she'd finally outrun time" feels templated.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, avoiding major artifacts or loops. However, several passages trend toward overwriting with stacked metaphors ("maze of intentions," "equation for hope," "hypothesis waiting for validation") that dilute impact, and some filter constructions like "Lila's breath caught" reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean prose with varied rhythm and strong information density—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor repetition of "hush" and "silence" serves the accumulative pattern. The final image "where dreams breathe" effectively recharges the opening's "dormant beast" breathing.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variety and atmospheric density, but suffers from overwriting in figurative language—nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated description ("liquid silver," "liminal hour," "slow fuse"). Template cadence appears in the warehouse sequence with repetitive "He [verb]" structures, and some phrases feel like thesaurus reaches ("errant legend seeker").

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains strong rhythm and varies sentence structure effectively, with vivid specifics like "twisted tube of obsidian-black fused sand." Some filter verbs ("he realized," "he deduced") and occasional synonym churn ("ancient methods"/"ancient wisdom") slightly dull immediacy but don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant repetition issues pervade the text: "geography of healing" appears four times, "lonesome splendor" three times, "explained absences" multiple times, creating paraphrase loops especially in the final third. The prose demonstrates moments of clarity and rhythm but suffers from template cadence ("She [verb], her [noun] [verb]ing") and overwriting in figurative density. The final three paragraphs essentially restate the same concepts without adding pressure or detail.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("air tasted of oil and regret") but suffers from overwriting in places. Mixed metaphors appear ("palace...like a frozen tear" doesn't align with later mechanical descriptions). Some redundancy exists ("trembled"/"shaking," multiple references to hypothesis). The final paragraphs contain template phrasing ("Together, they began to assemble the future") that dulls impact.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is solid—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot simultaneously. Some metaphorical density in places ("shimmered like a broken mirror," "jingled like a warning") and occasional abstraction ("something loosen in her chest") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong moments like "the pause of migrating geese—when the world held its breath mid-flight" with varied rhythm and density. However, template cadence appears in the item collection sequence ("The first breadcrumb...The third breadcrumb..."), and some figurative language feels forced ("eyes like fractured starlight"). Information density is generally high with purposeful detail selection.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("petals drifted like forgotten constellations") but suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing around "generational patterns" (appears 4 times). The phrase "approximating infinity" recurs without evolving meaning. Some sentences strain for profundity: "To move forward, they had to carry the past's lessons, not its scars" reads as thesis statement rather than earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("shadows that danced like restless spirits") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing ("the shape of collective grief"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("each story was a thread in the ribbon, each poem a stone in the wall of grief"). Template cadence emerges in the family history catalog section.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. However, several overwrought phrases blur clarity ("thirst for motion," "searing reverie," "creature of stone and salt"). The "heartbeat alive" metaphor and some abstract phrasing ("incremental absolution is the tide's true tide") create mild comprehension friction without sufficient payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose shows strong moments ("rose like a skeletal finger against the night sky") but suffers from occasional overwriting and register drift. Some metaphors strain ("dance of intentions played out across time") and the phrase "uncharted echoes" appears without clear grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, accelerating during the climactic thaw sequence. Strong verb choices like "clawed," "spiderwebbing," and specific nouns create momentum. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("writing the future"/"write the future," "predictive modeling"/"predictive models"). Filter constructions like "she believed" and "she'd argue" occasionally dull immediacy when direct perception would strengthen the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks, with lines often doing double work (the cloak both shields and connects to memory). Some figurative density in quieter moments ("cocoon," "second skin," "halo of light" in quick succession) and minor template cadence ("She'd collect...she'd have...she'd weave") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of striking beauty ("shadows pool and fade," "hollow warmth of memory") but suffers from occasional abstraction and repetitive constructions ("She knows," "she cannot stop," "she needs"). Some metaphors strain credibility ("architecture resents permanence"), and the density of figurative language occasionally obscures rather than illuminates.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("The sewer's stench clung to Elias like a second skin") but suffers from overwriting. Mixed metaphors appear ("razor wrapped in silk" for calm tone), and philosophical abstractions ("unmediated truth," "rationally rebellious faith") slow momentum. The "ache of understanding" redefinition feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows strong moments like "first note was a sob, raw and off-key" with varied sentence structures. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, abstract scaffolding appears in "Clara's motivation was simple, if vast" and conceptual redundancy weakens momentum with phrases like "vanishing arts" repeated without evolution. The paraphrase loop of "hatred etched itself into culture" and later "unlearning hatred" dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose occasionally strains with elevated diction ("celestial alignment began," "eerie, violet light") and some template phrasing ("Elara watched as," "She reached out"). The writing is competent but includes figurative density that doesn't always serve momentum, particularly in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, particularly in the descriptive passages. Deductions for filter-verb clustering ("Clara thought," "Clara frowned," "She hesitated") and some template cadence in dialogue tags. The "nectar dusk" description shows strong imagistic control that elevates the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of precision ("veined stone," "soil turned after rain") but suffers from paraphrase loops, particularly in paragraphs 3-4 where the concept of displaced objects gets restated without advancement. Template constructions like "She'd [verb]" appear repeatedly. The closing image of nodding porch lights and twitching curtains feels stock rather than earned through specific detail.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("silver strands trailing behind her like a lifeline"). Some redundancy appears in describing the revelations sequentially, and phrases like "animate lifeless structures" feel forced to incorporate required elements. The variation between action and reflection maintains momentum adequately.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in action sequences. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Minor issues include occasional abstraction ("texture of that loss" appears twice) and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages, but the closing image lands with clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "orchids bloomed like defiant lips." Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("moon climbed higher, its light slicing") and occasional abstraction ("saffron quiet—the color of remembered warmth"). Minor template cadence in "She'd read... She dipped... She'd painted."

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("sunlight filtered through mist like a promise") but suffers from occasional abstraction ("threads into stories," "voice had frayed") and template phrasing ("Lila's resolve hardened"). Information density varies; the bread-making sequence carries multiple layers while some tour passages feel scaffolded. No major loops, but some figurative language strains ("footprints in snow" for fading techniques).

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax—short declaratives ("The yoyo struck the sand") alternating with complex observations. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs: "The lighthouse behind him loomed, its beam slicing through the fog like a blade, though no keeper had lit it in decades" establishes setting, atmosphere, and abandonment. Minor template cadence in "Elias had...Elias had spent" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and selective detail without overwriting. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (the cloak both protects and reveals character history). Minor deductions for some abstract phrasing ("grotesque mosaic of teeth and eyes") and slight repetition of "luminance," but no loops or scaffolding that harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm during the performance sequence. However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("restless euphony," "fractal generating method") and some repetitive constructions ("She struck...She struck"). The "Yes," she breathed" follows a common template pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("silhouettes blurred against the horizon, as if the light itself were afraid") and occasional register elevation, but no loops or scaffolding. The final paragraph's italicized emphasis feels slightly heavy-handed.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, though several template constructions appear ("She'd traced...She pulled...She stepped"). The "gardeners of memory" closing lands effectively. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere, but some scaffolding remains ("Elara hesitated. Historians learned to distrust anecdotes"). Mixed metaphor issue with rose as revolutionaries but also as deadline marker reduces coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in descriptive passages. However, some overwriting appears: "hushed blaze of the setting sun gilded the pavilion's edges" and occasional abstract phrasing like "interlaced absence" repeated without always advancing meaning. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between exploration and discovery. Some overwriting in figurative language ("blackout crept through...like a thief," "swallowing the last flicker") and abstract compounds ("reclaimed stillness," "dappled resolve") that occasionally slow momentum. Information density adequate but could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong imagery and rhythm variation, particularly in descriptive passages, though some figurative density appears without full payoff ("Dreams are just grief with wings"). Minor template cadence emerges in the memory listing ("his laughter, his hands mending her broken toys, the way he'd hummed") and occasional abstract phrasing ("hole where his laughter once lived") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("each fissure a timeline of the drone strike") but suffers from template cadence in places ("She saw...She laughed...She walked"). Some paraphrase loops ("unused potential pooled"/"where unused potential pooled"). The stacked "She [verb]" pattern in the final third particularly weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful technical detail. Information density is high—most sentences advance plot while building atmosphere. Some figurative language borders on overwriting ("celestial keyhole," "crown of shadows") but doesn't obscure meaning. The final image of Lira pulling her coat tighter grounds the abstract revelation in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.0)
    Information density generally strong—most sentences advance discovery or deepen stakes. Template cadence appears mid-story ("He picked up...He saw...He understood...He continued") creating mechanical rhythm. Some paraphrase loops around silence/erasure concepts. Strong opening and closing lines, though "deep down" and "sharp and familiar" are stock phrases. The filter-verb stack in the vision sequences reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density with phrases like "mist clung like second skin" and maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths. Some abstract passages about synchronization and neutral territory create minor drag. The filter-verb cluster "Clara knew," "she'd learned," "Clara smiled" slightly dulls immediacy in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Deductions for scattered template phrases ("clutched in her palm," "gripped the paddle tighter") and one metaphor stretch ("sharp as a sextant's edge"). The "merrily melancholic" repetition works as intentional echo.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows strong moments like "liquid light where bioluminescent algae swirled like drowned stars" but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Filter verbs appear frequently ("she realized," "she felt"), and phrases like "delicately robust woman" feel forced. The final paragraph's momentum is good, but earlier sections have density issues with near-duplicate concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong image density and varied rhythm, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("to shed the old self was not to lose it, but to honor it" restates the final line's concept). Mixed metaphor coherence issue with "noose" for fortune paper that actually liberates. Template cadence in creature offering sequence ("The fox emerged...The owl followed...").

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("moss and silver birch, its edges dissolving into mist") but suffers from periodic density issues and some template phrasing ("She knelt," "She climbed," "She landed"). The "choking and bright" laugh and several metaphor vehicles work well, but runs of similar sentence openings in the middle section create mild monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("walls patched with fused asteroid metal," "gravitationally lighter when happy"). However, several abstract phrases reduce momentum: "fraying edges of reality itself," "hold it together long enough for others to see its beauty." Some paraphrase loops (peace/conflict restated multiple ways) and elevated diction in peak beats ("viscous shadows coiled") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("She didn't know what tomorrow would bring. But tonight, she'd finally grasped..." repeats the transformation insight). Template cadence in the final section with multiple "She [verb]" constructions weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Some elevated diction strains ("winking hush of their footsteps," "glittering facade") without earning resonance. Information density stays reasonable though several passages restate concepts ("cradle of sparks" explained multiple times). The final paragraph slides into abstract declaration rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "bruise-purple" and metaphor density in high-pressure beats. Template cadence appears in "She placed...The star dust...The eels..." sequence, and "living sigil" strains credibility without clearer grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure, with lines often doing multiple jobs (description advancing character and atmosphere). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "To rarefy: to purify, to make rare, to strip away" restates the same concept. Template cadence emerges in "Kael had salvaged... He'd repurposed... He'd carried" construction.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the duel. However, several template constructions appear ("She held...her eyes sharp," "He countered, his mechanical arm sweeping") and the phrase "dignified chaos" repeats without evolution, creating minor cadence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("luminous fracture against the darkness"). Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "rebuild himself from fragments" / "how I rebuild" and repetitive "Cedar's [action]" structures. The "garden of words" / "brick in the wall" mixing strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in the opening and closing passages. Deductions for figurative density in places ("skeletal hand," "sugar in rain" cluster) and occasional register elevation ("residual energy," "strategic creative") that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful imagery ("iridescent as a soap bubble"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("The collective memory...was unraveling" followed by redundant monsoon-erasure explanation), and some metaphors strain ("tapestry woven from generations of dreams and deeds").

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good rhythm. Some overwriting in metaphors ("bruise of cerulean," "translucent as sea foam") and occasional redundancy. The lace-as-language conceit occasionally strains clarity but mostly works.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally clean and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. One minor figurative strain exists: comparing a fern frond to a "waveform of a dying pulsar" feels slightly forced, though it remains legible and voice-motivated. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or artifacts obscure cause/effect or the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A slight tendency toward dense figurative language in the opening paragraph creates a minor momentum drag, but it quickly clears and does not harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally lucid and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a few phrases verge on thesaurus-churn ("rectified her silence," "unshaken marvels") which, while conceptually apt, slightly disrupt the otherwise concrete texture. The sentence-level craft is otherwise exemplary, weaving action, setting, and interiority seamlessly. No loops or scaffolding obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exceptional, dense with vivid imagery and rhythmic control. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a cluster of complex metaphors in high-pressure beats (e.g., “its glass fractured like a spider’s web,” “books floated like jellyfish”) which, while beautiful, slightly slow the momentum of the initial descent.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is vivid and concise, with strong rhythm and sensory detail. Minor artifacts: "amplified quiet" repeats, and "sanctioned moon" feels slightly elevated. No loops or scaffold obscuring closure. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits high information density and varied syntax without artifacts. Figurative language ("soft edges and half-truths") is purposeful and coherent. Minor scaffold in "foggy lucidity" phrase slightly reduces momentum but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and sensory detail. However, a minor instance of overwriting occurs in the high-pressure beat: "dissolving into a swarm of fireflies" is a slightly mixed metaphor (pixelation + insects) that briefly muddles clarity. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent, and the final lines are clear and resonant. This minor artifact prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("a ghost’s whisper") is purposeful and taught early. A minor template cadence appears in the key-turning sequence ("The first key... The second key..."), creating a slight rhythmic loop, but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with excellent rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat ("a scream of glass shattering, of promises unraveling"), which momentarily risks cliché, though it is quickly anchored back to the character's exhilaration.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for the repetitive use of "quietly savvy" which creates a slight template cadence. Figurative language is largely coherent and purposeful, supporting the luminous tone without muddying clarity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and efficient, with strong rhythmic control. The line "Abandonment, he mused, was rarely sudden" is a moment of strategic telling that increases density. A single, minor artifact appears: the phrase "thoughtfully spirited" is a label-like trait introduction. However, the trait is immediately demonstrated through action, mitigating the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythm. Minor artifacts include a repetitive stem ("afraid") in the climax and a slightly mixed metaphor ("genetic hand-me-downs, a map of her mother’s betrayals"). Information density is high, and closure beats remain clear.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures that mirror tension. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful ("stone teeth gnawing at the wind"). No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Minor overload in "ambered hush" and "marbled hush" slightly risks pattern fatigue but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity, doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the sound was fractal, repeating in layers"). A very minor instance of scaffold phrasing exists ("The experience was overwhelming, yet Unit-17 remained remarkably composed"), but it does not harm closure or momentum. Information density is excellent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor artifact occurs in the phrase "ambiguously clear," which feels slightly contradictory and label-like, though it is quickly dramatized in the next sentence. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure, but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive with high information density. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final line resolves with a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally polished with good rhythm and clarity. Minor artifact: "mechanically warm precision" feels slightly redundant. Figurative language ("time itself stretch, thinning like taffy") is effective and not overused. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for the aforementioned filter-verb stack ("she imagined," "she knew") which creates a slight momentum drag in a crucial beat, and a single instance of near-paraphrase ("secrets" / "mystery"). Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, rhythmic control, and clear propulsion. One minor artifact: the metaphor "like a steel barnacle" is slightly mixed (barnacles are organic, not steel-like), creating a minor coherence issue. Otherwise, the writing is concise, vivid, and free of loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with strong information density. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) for a template cadence in the climax: "The hum died. The chamber went dark." This slightly dulls the closure's immediacy but does not break clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly accomplished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "becoming nothing and everything all at once") which slightly muddles clarity. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion and information density are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward poetic abstraction in a few phrases (e.g., “bridge between the mundane and the mysterious”) that, while voice-consistent, slightly soften the concrete immediacy of the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and strong metaphors. Minor overwriting in phrases like "sensitively perceptive gaze" leans slightly toward label-speak, but clarity and momentum are maintained. No loops or artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward ornate description in high-pressure beats (e.g., "their rhythm a familiar enigma"), which creates a minor register drift. However, the prose remains clear and propulsive, and the closure image is undulled.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, but minor artifacts appear: a template cadence in "He dipped his brush... He pressed another button..." and a slight synonym churn around "unraveled/unraveling." These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished and evocative, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. However, minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("conductor of unheard symphonies" / "symphonies, unheard but felt") and a slightly over-written phrase ("chronologically homesick"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score. Information density is high, and momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact is the phrase "procedural generation of her own life," which introduces a slightly technical register that is not fully taught or integrated into the voice, creating a small dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly crafted with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences are purposeful and advance multiple elements. A minor deduction for a slight rhythmic predictability in some descriptive passages, but overall, the line-level craft is strong and supports the accumulative drive without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Rhythm and syntax expertly modulate with the rising tension. One slightly abstract metaphor ("a storm in themselves") in a high-pressure beat prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. Minor artifacts: "sacred energy" leans slightly generic, and "prismatic streaks" could be more specific. No loops or scaffolding issues. Figurative language serves the accumulative texture ("vessel for memory," "tapestry of inherited sorrow"). Closure image is clear and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. There is a minor instance of potential register drift with the phrase "ethically playful," which feels slightly analytical for the voice, but it is a single, small artifact that does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent with the voice. A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in phrases like "purveyor of half truths wrapped in the scent of sincerity," which, while voice-motivated, borders on the ornate. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and propel the narrative forward. Figurative language ("domed windows glowed like lighthouse eyes") is precise and enhances atmosphere without muddying clarity. A single minor paraphrase loop ("cycles of compassion... grand gestures but small, repeated acts") is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. The prose is largely free of artifacts, though a minor register drift occurs with the phrase "luminescent ache" in the climax, slightly dulling the immediacy of an otherwise embodied emotional peak.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the cadence of the canals and the climax. No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle are present. The final paragraph's cadence provides a satisfying resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control, accelerating with the ritual's hum. Figurative language is pattern-taught ("mathematics of emotion") and pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good momentum. Minor deductions for occasional dense phrasing ("sapphire hush" is slightly ornamental) and a template cadence in the opening description. No major artifacts or loops that obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly efficient, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for the slightly forced recurrence of "circuitously sincere," which creates a small text artifact. Otherwise, sentences advance multiple jobs without scaffold or loop, and clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("wryly earnest," "haggard awe") and the phrase "threshing meaning" which leans abstract. However, information density is high and momentum is maintained, with no clarity issues at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight template cadence ("The cave itself was a living thing." followed by a description of its walls) and a register drift in the pilgrim's dialogue ("Unseen forces are fickle..."), but clarity at closure is unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, vivid sensory detail, and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. The opening and closing lines are particularly strong, anchoring the voice and resolving with a powerful, recharging image.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with strong sensory detail and varied syntax. A minor instance of scaffold exists ("His analytical mind noted... But his artistic side..."), creating a slight analytical pause in an otherwise immersive high-pressure beat. This prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "unheard symphonies" leans slightly decorative, creating a small figurative muddle in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and vivid with high information density and clear propulsion. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language ("shimmered like a fractured rainbow") is purposeful and taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with vivid imagery ("scent of lilies and the echo of a con artist’s honest child"). A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the line "liquefying rigid thinking," which feels more academic than the surrounding voice, and a template cadence in "She waited, counting the seconds...".

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor artifact: a slight register drift in the climax (“torrent of invented histories”) feels slightly less character-bound than the established voice, creating a small clarity dip in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and controlled with strong rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for a handful of complex sentences that require re-reading and one near-cliché ("hit like a tidal wave"). Overall, the line-level craft supports the accumulative drive and lyrical tone without significant momentum loss or artifacting.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off ("like a fossilized question"). Syntax and rhythm accelerate with the scene's intensity without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentences like "The air smelled of fried dough and diesel" do multiple jobs, establishing setting and tone efficiently. Read-aloud rhythm is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly controlled, lyrical, and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and variation. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the summit felt colder, the silence deeper" conveys both setting and emotional cost). A minor, isolated instance of potential synonym churn ("finite" and "last" used closely) prevents a higher score, but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight synonym churn ("mist clung," "blurring the edges") in the opener and a faint template cadence in "She carried... She dipped... She traced." However, these do not obscure causality or dull the closure, and information density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and vivid, with high information density ("a skeletal relic of surveyors past," "veins of liquid fire"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the ice-chipping scene. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, enhancing without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and concise, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight paraphrase loop exists between "wild hush" in the first and final paragraphs, and the phrase "shared balance" is used twice, feeling slightly thematic. However, these do not obscure cause/effect or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the peak beat ("jailer" feels slightly abstract for the POV's lexicon). Otherwise, the language is precise and propulsive, with no loops or scaffolding to obscure the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. There is minor overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("a lullaby of deceit," "a mosaic of memory and myth") that slightly mutes the immediacy of the father's ghost confrontation, but it does not harm closure clarity. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is dense and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting is present (e.g., "shimmered with a spectral iridescence" followed by detailed description of the veil could be tighter), but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure. The final paragraphs are particularly propulsive and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "corridors twisted like a nervous system." Sentences advance multiple layers: "her heart hauntingly optimistic" carries emotional and thematic weight. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor deduct for a cluster of filter verbs in a high-pressure beat ("Lirael froze, her breath catching. She felt it then—") which slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, high information density and clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structure. Figurative language ("honeyed streaks," "pulse quickened") is purposeful and coherent. No significant loops, scaffolds, or register drifts were detected to obscure clarity or momentum.

    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("needles darted like comets") is purposeful and pattern-taught. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold; every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative density appears in the climax ("sound like wind through church bells"), slightly softening the immediacy of the peak beat. However, the language remains purposeful and advances the story's atmospheric goals without creating significant momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("ghost’s fingers," "lotus-hearted ache"). A single potential scaffold phrase ("unknotting like a frayed rope") is minor and does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density (e.g., "weaving strands of color into a temporary mural"). Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated ("fog clung like a second skin"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm supports scene needs, from pensive opening to exuberant climax. Minor ornamentation ("stubborn, glorious joy") doesn't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple layers. Minor artifact: "methodically playful" is repeated, creating a slight template cadence. No figurative muddle in peak beats, and closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally crisp and propulsive with vivid imagery. A few minor artifacts: "converging chaos" is slightly abstract, and the final action sequence ("scattered the fungi spores") is efficient but could be more tactile. Rhythm and clarity remain strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion and clarity. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. A minor instance of potential synonym churn ("half-sung lullabies" / "off-key wind") exists but does not obscure closure or cause momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("sighed into silence," "liquid light"). A minor rhythm stumble exists in "a nameless emotion, half-formed and trembling," which slightly softens the peak closure beat, but overall clarity and propulsion are superb.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. However, a minor prose artifact exists: the repetitive use of "unsnarled" as a stem for her methodological actions creates a slight template cadence ("unsnarled the first knot," "unsnarled it via interconnected promises"). This does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lush and controlled, with high information density. However, minor overwriting creeps in during peak beats (e.g., "dappled resolve shimmering like volcanic glass"), applying a slight figurative density penalty. The sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic control are otherwise excellent, and the closure lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("sunlight filtering through the skylight in a golden haze"). A minor, near-artifact moment occurs with the phrase "blooming and withering all at once," which risks abstraction at the closure, but it is a single, brief slip in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.0)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single minor flaw: the phrase "featherly determined" risks being a slightly overly precious coinage, creating a tiny artifact, but it is consistent with the voice and does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is polished and evocative with high information density and clear propulsion. Sentence-level rhythm is varied and purposeful. No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle detract from the clarity of key beats, including the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally high with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward slightly overwrought figurative language ("prismatic whispers," "cheerful gloom... paradox she wore like a second skin") creates minor density spikes that momentarily stall momentum, though clarity is never broken.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and high-density, doing multiple jobs (e.g., "neon signs flickering like nervous fish" establishes setting and tone). Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, with varied rhythms that mirror the arcade's chaos. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for occasional moments of slightly overwrought density in figurative language (e.g., "obsidian grace, a darkness that shimmered like polished onyx") that, while beautiful, momentarily slow the high-pressure beat of the dance's initiation.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences are propulsive and varied, doing multiple jobs of advancing character, setting, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is consistent, coherent, and deeply integrated into the POV's voice.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density, varied syntax, and zero artifacts or loops. Figurative language ("spilled milk," "liquid silver") is precise and voice-motivated, and the prose maintains propulsion even in reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose has high information density without artifice. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated ("serene upheaval"). Rhythm varies purposefully (e.g., fragmented clauses during balloon launch). No loops or scaffold; peak beats maintain clarity despite poetic density.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential overwriting exists ("sensitively perceptive" feels slightly telling). However, the prose is largely concise, vivid, and propulsive, with figurative language that consistently enhances rather than obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly polished with strong rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potential density in the peak beat ("The effort of maintaining the dusky harmony... was exhausting") which slightly slows momentum, preventing a perfect score. Otherwise, sentences are purposeful and advance multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A minor instance of slightly ornamental language ("slow dance of celestial bodies") appears early but does not harm clarity or momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent information density and rhythmic variety. A minor figurative muddle exists in "scattering salt grains like confetti," which slightly clashes with the grim tone, but this is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure. Otherwise, zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, but shows minor signs of overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "each flake fell like a whispered secret" followed by other dense metaphors). This creates a slight drag on momentum, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, clear propulsion, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and legible. Sentence-level rhythm is varied and supports the accumulative, contemplative mood. A masterclass in line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is flawless: high information density ("geometric shadow, a map of loss and hope"), varied rhythm, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is cohesive and voice-motivated ("mist curled like spun sugar"). Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. Read-aloud rhythm is natural and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm, though slight overwriting occurs in stacked modifiers ("green-gold veils," "clear and aching"). No loops or scaffold artifacts; closure clarity is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor deductions for a few instances of potential register drift ("a hymn to the walkers") and a slightly mixed metaphor ("time was a river eroding even the sturdiest banks"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts; clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied syntax and rhythm accelerating under pressure. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("voice laughed, a sound like wind through reeds") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythmic control. However, a prose artifact is present: the phrase "shifting grace" is repeated several times, moving from a potent concept to a slightly templated cadence by the end. This repetition dulls the closure image's impact slightly, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, sentence-level propulsion and information density are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control.

There are no artifacts, loops, or register drifts to obscure clarity or momentum, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific diction ("gnarled branches," "jagged line of imperfection"). Information density is high; most sentences advance multiple elements. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing exists ("The orchard was a tangle..."), and the modifier "accidental" before "wisdom" slightly diminishes the earned resonance. No artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving atmosphere and character. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected. Sentence-level propulsion is strong throughout, accelerating and breathing with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language ("squeaking like a ghost’s whisper") is effective and coherent. Rhythm varies naturally, and there are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure clarity. Read-aloud quality is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly evocative and rhythmic, with excellent information density. One mixed metaphor slightly muddles clarity: "melting into sound" contradicts the established physical logic of the ice, which shatters and vibrates but does not melt. This is a minor artifact in an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and concise, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. A minor figurative density issue occurs in the high-pressure climax ("the fragile alchemy of hope and memory" feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in that moment), preventing a higher score. Otherwise, the read-aloud rhythm is strong, and sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, precise imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions (e.g., "fog condense into pearl-like droplets" establishes setting, tone, and theme). A minor -0.2 deduction for a slight scaffold phrase ("she smiled, understanding now") that tells a beat already shown through her actions and the subsequent, superior metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. Minor overwriting occurs in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., “a chain reaction of light that filled the chamber with a roaring, golden radiance” could be tighter). No loops or scaffolding artifacts, and clarity is maintained throughout the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. There is a minor tendency toward slightly overwrought description in a few phrases (e.g., "painted the walls in silver"), but this does not create loops or obscure closure. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. A minor figurative muddle exists in "sprout wings of patience," which mixes metaphors. Rhythm is controlled, and sentence structures vary effectively to support emotional beats. The closure image is sharp and uncluttered by scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a high-pressure beat ("a vaulting hush that made the air itself seem to hold its breath"), which slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. A minor figurative muddle occurs with "the stairway of ascension had been a metaphor, a journey to self-realization," which tells a concept the scene has already shown brilliantly, creating a small loop. This summarization slightly dulls the pristine closure image but does not break causality or obscure the final effect.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("teaching suffocating to breathe") is voice-motivated and clear. Sentences vary effectively to match emotional beats, though minor abstraction ("loaded emptiness") slightly softens peak clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor register drift occurs in the phrase "virtuously mischievous," which feels slightly authorial. The closing paragraphs demonstrate excellent rhythmic control and clarity, landing the closure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor flaw: a slight figurative overload in the climax ("golden shadows deepened, stretching... like liquid gold") creates a momentary density spike, but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery ("blossoms that glowed like captive stars"). The prose is taut and propulsive. A single, minor instance of a template cadence ("He wandered... He approached... He pulled...") in the climax paragraph prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly accomplished with vivid, concrete language and strong rhythmic control. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "silent tombs" conveys weight and loss). A single, minor scaffold phrase ("he felt a flicker of something tactfully hopeful") slightly disrupts the otherwise impeccable texture and momentum in a key early beat.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a template cadence ("Mara crouched...", "Mara pulled...") in early paragraphs and a slight filter phrase ("Mara’s mind raced") in a key beat. No issues with clarity or momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and purposeful, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. Sentences are crafted to advance atmosphere and character simultaneously ("a lattice of colors that shimmered like a ghost’s whisper"). There is minimal scaffolding or redundancy. A very minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on complex figurative language in a few spots, though it remains coherent and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("branches twisted like ancient veins").

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and propelled, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "Swirling leaves danced... their edges sharp as knives" conveys atmosphere, threat, and motion). A minor rhythm hiccup occurs in the summary of the journal's discovery ("digging through rubble"), but it's strategic compression. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("its surface a molten gold that mirrored the zodiac coin"). No significant loops, artifacts, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("sky bled gold," "stone ribs") is purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and minimal scaffolding. Minor thesaurus-churn in "proprioceptive" and "bioluminescent" slightly distances the reader in early beats. No loops or artifacts; closure image is clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, but a tendency toward stacked modifiers ("translucent silk and iron lattices that hummed with trapped light") creates minor momentum drag in the opening, though clarity is maintained at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously ("The dust here was thicker, layered in years of neglect"). There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final image is sharp and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, efficient imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often serving multiple functions. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on compound-complex sentences in high-tempo beats, which can momentarily slow momentum, but no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance multiple layers of story and character. A minor instance of potential scaffold exists in the phrase "sharp as regret," which leans slightly decorative. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exemplary, with no loops or artifacts that obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, original metaphors. A minor -0.1 deduction for a slight rhythmic stumble in the phrase "its melody devolving into dissonance," which feels slightly less fluid than the surrounding text. Otherwise, information density is high and momentum is maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere concisely. A very minor instance of potential synonym churn ("hollow, a vessel emptied of purpose") exists but does not obscure sense or momentum, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of slightly ornate phrasing ("heavy with velvet disquiet") but it is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is flawless, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly evocative and dense with meaning, successfully advancing story and atmosphere. Minor artifacts appear as slightly muddled metaphors in the vortex sequence ("time lost meaning") and a template cadence in the list of seeds. The closure image, however, is crystal clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful with strong rhythm. A minor paraphrase loop occurs ("listening, always listening" echoes "favor listening over noise"), and a filter verb cluster ("Lira realized") slightly obscures causality at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("Its domes, etched with the faded glow of ancient constellations..."). There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The opening line anchors voice and stakes; the final line resolves with a resonant image that recharges prior motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. Minor artifacts appear, such as the slightly cliché "baking under a sun that had forgotten mercy" and the near-paraphrase of "unspoken words" and "words that had never been uttered," creating a minor loop that slightly dulls the opening's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, serving character and atmosphere. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "borrowed-time timekeeper" feels slightly forced, a rare moment of alliterative flourish that briefly clashes with the otherwise precise lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.6)
    Exquisite line-level craft. Sentences are lush yet precise, propelling the narrative with a varied, musical rhythm. Figurative language is consistent, coherent, and deeply integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor prose artifact appears in Kael's dialogue, which slips into explanatory register ("A cocktail of pheromones...") that feels slightly out of sync with the otherwise lyrical and embodied texture of the narration.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly economical, with strong rhythmic control. A single minor artifact exists: the compound adjective "gloom-hill" in the first line feels slightly forced upon a close read, creating a tiny stumble in an otherwise flawless opening anchor. This does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats (e.g., "wind’s whispers," "voices that crackled like dry leaves") and a near-paraphrase loop describing the settlement's change. These do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. The prose is precise and vivid, though a minor filter-verb stack ("Elio mused," "he realized") and the slightly elevated diction in the grandmother's dialogue prevent a higher score. No loops or artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, specific imagery ("dagger of frost," "liquid starlight"). Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs of action, description, and emotion. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("He was no ordinary thief") is offset by otherwise exceptional craftsmanship and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with sentences doing multiple jobs. One minor overwriting moment: "sound curled like smoke" slightly strains logic. Otherwise, no loops or artifacts; clarity and momentum are maintained through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative muddle in one peak beat ("swirling into stardust" slightly clashes with the physical logic of the feather's dissolution). Otherwise, high information density and clear propulsion with no significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("fierce repose" following "deliberate" steps) and a potentially mixed metaphor in "woven hush" (though it pays off). These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact exists: a slight over-density of figurative language in the high-pressure beat ("bruised sky," "crooked teeth," "forged hush") creates a subtle, momentary drag on momentum just before the climax. This prevents a higher score, though clarity at closure remains untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly evocative and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor instance of potential register drift ("quilt memories together") and a single filter verb ("she believed") slightly temper the score, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control without loops or artifacts. Figurative language ("weight of decades lifting") is precise and voice-motivated. The final sentence achieves textural specificity and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly evocative and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "raw solace" feels slightly out of register with the POV's lexicon in that moment, creating a small figurative muddle in a peak beat. Otherwise, sentences are clean, concise, and advance multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language ("chandelier of green") is purposeful and effective. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("The eye, he claimed,") and a near-paraphrase loop prevent a higher score, but clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally strong, vivid, and purposeful, with a good rhythm. Minor artifacts are present, such as a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the opening ("bruise-purple sky," "slick with salt and mist that clung like cobwebs") which, while beautiful, slightly delays narrative momentum. The line-level craft is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Minor overwriting appears in a high-pressure beat ("danced like ghostly figures"), triggering a slight deduction. However, rhythm and syntax effectively support the accumulative pressure, and no loops or scaffold artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language ("cobalt grotto... stretching like a bruise") is consistent, purposeful, and legible. No loops, scaffold, or muddle in peak beats. A near-flawless execution.

    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated. A single minor paraphrase loop exists ("I laughed, though it was a hollow sound") but does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacting: the phrase "occluded views" is repeated, and the final paragraph's "tapestry of resilience" metaphor, while effective, introduces a slightly mixed image alongside the weaving metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor rhythm issue exists in one beat ("Kael smiled, his scars now a language only he could read. He tucked the crow quill..."), creating a slight template cadence, but this is a hairline slip that does not touch closure. No figurative muddle or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and vivid, precise imagery ("a silence so thick it seemed to vibrate").

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for figurative density in the climax ("jagged shadows that danced like dervishes") creates a slight muddle in a peak beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional, with varied syntax and a powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. However, minor artifacts are present: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some high-pressure beats ("time pooled like mercury") and a few repetitive stems ("the ring absorbed..."). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score by introducing occasional decorative texture.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is vivid and concise with high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (“warped the air like glass”). Minor deduction for a slight register drift in Lira’s dialogue (“thresh meaning from experience”) which feels elevated for the scene’s urgency, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("liquid silver," "symphony of stillness"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally to support the emotional beats and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact is the slightly label-like phrase "analytically intuitive," though it is quickly dramatized. There is no scaffold or loopiness to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. However, minor overwriting and a few mixed metaphors ("auroral sorrow that made my chest ache") slightly muddle peak beats. The POV shift is the primary line-level artifact, penalized here as it affects clarity. Otherwise, propulsion and clarity are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere efficiently. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Minor register drift in "less like a guide and more like a prayer" feels slightly elevated but not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm, though it occasionally leans into overwriting ("a shadow without a voice") and a repetitive simile ("like a bruise on glass"). These are minor artifacts that do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. Minor scaffold exists in the slightly repetitive phrasing of "unspoken words" and the concept of "planting." A single mixed metaphor ("planting forests of second thoughts") slightly muddles an otherwise precise image, but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for the slightly ornate phrase "combative tenderness," which feels momentarily out of step with the POV's lexicon.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("blades slicing the sky into fractured shards of light") is vivid, coherent, and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts were detected. Sentence-level propulsion is maintained throughout, even in reflective moments.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, a pattern of slight overwriting emerges in high-pressure beats, with clustered figurative language ("lantern-moth hush," "suspended breath") that, while beautiful, creates a density that slightly obscures momentum. The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and concise, with high information density ("its brass keys glinting like molten gold"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the climax. Minor figurative density in high-pressure beats ("fractals that pulsed like a heartbeat") is pattern-taught and pays off. One near-paraphrase loop ("awaken" echoed) but does not obscure closure. No scaffolding or synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., the lens description also establishes theme). A minor artifact is noted: the phrase "powerfully gentle" is used twice, creating a slight repetitive stem. However, this does not obscure causality or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though figurative language occasionally stacks in high-pressure beats (e.g., "aglow with stars that moved like living things"). One minor paraphrase loop ("not a cure for grief, but a language for it") slightly dulls momentum but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with excellent rhythmic control. Minor figurative clutter appears in the opening ("thousand inverted hourglasses") but is pattern-taught and does not harm closure. There is a single instance of potential scaffold in "steady curious" but it is anchored by a concrete childhood memory, minimizing penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on the "atoms of nostalgia" metaphor, which appears twice and risks feeling slightly decorative in its second use, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely lucid and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a template cadence (“Lirael frowned,” “Lirael thought”) and a slight synonym churn around “hope” and “shadow” in the explanatory beat with Thalos. These do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control ("its iridescent scales catching the starlight"). Minor artifactual density in peak beats ("fragility felt less like a flaw and more like a language") slightly obscures immediacy but doesn't harm closure. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A single, minor paraphrase loop occurs ("seeking closure" repeated in first and last paragraphs), but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight template cadence in describing the trees' songs and a register drift in the father's dialogue ("a synthesis of wind and machinery") that feels tonally elevated for the moment. These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, vivid imagery, and controlled rhythm. Sentences advance story and atmosphere without scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("shimmered like a mirage") is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation and information density. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats ("seraphically mundane thread," "fabric," "lullaby," "razor," "void," "chasm") creates a slight pattern of overwriting that, while beautiful, occasionally borders on diminishing clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with vivid, specific language and strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in "regally unpretentious," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's lexicon in a high-pressure beat.

    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("The sea level monitoring station clung to the edge of the atoll like a barnacle"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single instance of near-repetition ("paths disappear" / "paths that disappeared") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. The phrase "thunderous serenity" presents a minor figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat, acting as a slight artifact that reduces clarity at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structure. Figurative language is purposeful and effective, such as the kite's tail flapping "like a wounded bird."

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("pearl of stillness") is pattern-taught and pays off. Sentences vary effectively to mirror Lila's internal state, from frantic to calm. Read-aloud rhythm is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly efficient, with excellent rhythmic variation. A minor risk of figurative overload exists ("shattered mirrors," "ghosts," "moth") but the pattern is taught and coherent, serving the accumulative design without muddying peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language ("glowing like bleached bone") is consistent and purposeful.

No artifacts obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward thesaurus-churn in peak beats, e.g., "dissonant zigzag of static" and "fractured notes" feel slightly redundant. However, information density is high, and the language consistently advances character and atmosphere without major loops or artifacts that obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and strong verbs ("gnawed," "unearth"). Minor artifacts: "spidery handwriting" is a cliché, and "celestial heartbeat" metaphor is slightly mixed. However, rhythm controls pressure effectively, and closure beats are clear and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally high with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction is applied for a slight pattern of repetitive sentence stems ("He reached," "He saw," "He stood") in the middle beats, creating a mild template cadence that slightly dulls momentum before the strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor risk of overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "lavender and cello" metaphor) but clarity remains intact. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; sentence-level propulsion supports accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and purposeful, with high information density. However, minor artifacting is present, including a template cadence in the description of the geode's facets and a slight register drift in phrases like "fractally, somatically, undeniably real," which feels slightly elevated for the POV's peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. One minor artifact: "factually mystical" is a slightly jarring register drift in an otherwise consistent voice. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolding, even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for occasional dense metaphor clusters ("forgotten time," "ancient bones") that slightly slow momentum in early beats, but clarity remains intact and closure is unharmed. No loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "fixing what’s broken" is repeated in the first and final paragraphs, creating a slight thematic echo that dulls the final image's impact. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("like a second skin," "like a knife through linen") is precise, purposeful, and coherent. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscuring clarity. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, perfectly matching the story's contemplative yet forward-moving pace.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptional: high information density, zero loops or scaffold, and vivid figurative language that enhances clarity. Sentences advance story and atmosphere ("horizon bled orange"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with the vision. No artifacts obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high. A single instance of potential scaffold exists ("The quivering hush of the night amplified his resolve.") which slightly abstracts a key moment, but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and no scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("ink shimmered like liquid starlight") is pattern-taught and serves the atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion varies effectively with the hum's crescendo and the subsequent stillness.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, precise imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor instance of potentially elevated diction ("prismatic quiet") is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple jobs. A minor figurative muddle occurs with the voice "like shattering glass" following the starlight chimes, creating a slight register clash in a peak beat. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor deductions for a template cadence pattern ("His breath came...", "He’d come here...", "He fumbled...") and a slightly mixed metaphor ("swallowing him whole" vs. "pressing in").

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and sensory density. A minor figurative pile-up occurs in the opening simile ("like a second skin, blurring... into ghosts"), and the phrase "furrowed hush" is a slight register drift, but these do not harm closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally crisp and purposeful, with high information density. A slight template cadence emerges in the climax ("Clara didn’t know... but she knew...") which slightly dulls the peak beat's immediacy, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm, vivid imagery, and excellent information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a high-pressure beat ("the music becoming a whirlwind, the pixels... swirling into a vortex"), which creates a mild sense of abstraction at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor template cadence appears in the reflective sequence ("He remembered...", "He reached..."), and the phrase "polished calm" is repeated, creating a slight scaffold effect that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with strong metaphorical cohesion. Minor overwriting in peaks ("a tide finding its shore") slightly softens clarity, but propulsion and rhythm remain compelling. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("trees twisted like dancers") is purposeful and coherent. There are no noticeable loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure causality. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating and breathing in step with the scene's needs, particularly in the vortex sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats, creating a slight density overload without a taught pattern. This risks obscuring clarity, though closure remains legible. No loops or scaffold issues, and syntax varies purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("torches flickered like souls") is pattern-taught and serves atmosphere. One minor loop exists ("fiercely gentle" is used twice), but it is a purposeful reprise that charges the closure and does not obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear and concise with strong momentum and high information density. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, varying with scene needs. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. A very minor instance of near-paraphrase ("appraisal manuals to deflect grief" / "using trivia to fill the silence") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "tendril of light twisting like a vine") and a single potential paraphrase loop ("reestablish the connection" / "reestablished what the spirit’s departure had fractured").

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is flawless, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly coherent. Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic control are masterful, accelerating and breathing in step with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on abstract nouns in the climax ("connection," "hope") where concrete embodiment would have heightened the payoff, but the line-level craft is otherwise exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for the slightly strained metaphor "like a thousand green fingers," which introduces a mild figurative muddle. However, this is an isolated issue that does not harm closure or causality, and the overall line-level craft is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm, vivid imagery, and high information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. A single, minor artifact occurs: "cautious exuberance" is a told summary of emotion rather than shown through embodied action, creating a slight scaffold in an otherwise propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly accomplished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "a Rorschach test of possibility") where figurative language stacks, but clarity and momentum are never lost, and closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few phrases (e.g., "radiant hush that clung") and a potential filter verb stack ("she realized, with a chill of wonder") in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "vineyard hush of stillness," "clouds pooled like liquid silver"), but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure. A single instance of potential synonym churn ("quiet understanding" / "quietly") is negligible.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor prose artifact exists: the phrase "sincerely insincere" is a near-oxymoronic label that, while character-revealing, borders on diagnostic summary. This prevents a score in the highest band, though it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting (e.g., "like a spider spinning a web from the breath of the wind"), introducing minor decorative density that slightly slows momentum without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and good rhythm. However, it exhibits minor text artifacts: the phrase "weathered resolve" is used twice, and "pulse left wandering" appears three times, creating a slight template cadence. These repetitions are the only factor preventing a higher score, though they do not seriously harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and concise, with high information density and varied sentence structure. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. A minor figurative density in the climax ("brilliant dimness," "lingering luminance") slightly risks coherence but does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, varied rhythm, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("its mast a skeletal finger"), and sentences propel the narrative forward without scaffolding or loops. The final paragraph's cadence is particularly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "mind a sparkler of curiosity," "doubt that had clung to him like stardust"), which, while beautiful, occasionally borders on ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong sentence-level propulsion. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines ("The observatory fell silent... Elias picked up the atlas page") but does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, though a slight paraphrase loop dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, with strong information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("its glassy surface catching the first blush of dawn"). No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles are present. A single minor filter verb cluster ("Elias felt it") in the climax prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor deductions for a slight scaffold feel in the opening paragraph ("her job was to watch, to listen") and a single potentially mixed metaphor ("the town’s skeletal remains").

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control. A minor figurative overload occurs in the opening paragraph ("liquid stained glass," "trapped starlight"), but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffolding. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. One minor paraphrase loop identified ("keep revising, keep inventing" feels slightly repetitive of prior beats). Figurative language is cohesive and supports pressure without muddying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density ("history rewrote itself beneath his feet"). Rhythm varies effectively with scene tension. A minor template cadence appears in two consecutive "He [verbed]" sentences during the climax, and "ego death" is slightly diagnostic, but these do not obscure closure clarity or cause significant momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythm. However, a template cadence appears in the sequence of investigative steps ("First, he examined... Next, he analyzed..."), which slightly dulls momentum. This is a minor artifact that does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control and sensory specificity. Minor scaffold is present in adjacent sentences restating exhaustion ("his arms felt like lead, until his voice was a hoarse whisper"), triggering a small deduction. However, information density is high, and figurative language is consistent and purposeful, never muddying clarity at the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and legible ("blanket of mist," "ancient ghosts"). There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts. A single minor deduction for a potentially mixed metaphor ("veil of sleep" and "veil-walkers").

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and vivid, but suffers from minor template cadence ("The penny dropped...") and a repetitive sentence stem ("The nexus shuddered... The nexus's glow faded..."). These artifacts are noticeable but do not significantly obscure cause/effect or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, but suffers minor artifacting: "serenely electric" is repeated, and some metaphors are slightly mixed ("shadows stretched like spectral fingers" followed by "humming with... static"). This does not obscure closure, but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor prose artifact appears in the final paragraph: "resiliently positive" is a label-like phrase that echoes earlier telling, creating a slight scaffold in an otherwise pristine closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the climax. A slight scaffold phrase ("unsettling, yet peaceful") appears at closure, and a minor synonym churn ("rational enchantment" echoed) slightly dulls the final image's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and purposeful, with strong information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere without scaffold or loops. A single minor deduction for a potential filter verb cluster ("Lirael felt a somber marvel wash over her—a sense of awe") in a peak beat, though it is immediately embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and effective, though a single minor mixed metaphor ("a heartbeat trapped in amber" slightly clashes with the vibrational nature of sound) prevents a higher score. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and propelled, with high information density. Minor artifact: "phase transitions" concept introduces a slight technical register that feels mildly incongruous with the voice. Otherwise, sentences are clean, varied, and advance story without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, vivid metaphors, and varied rhythm. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles.

Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with propulsion and clarity. Figurative language is generally purposeful and legible, supporting the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with sentences advancing multiple jobs of story, character, and atmosphere. Rhythm is expertly controlled, accelerating with the climax. A single minor issue: the metaphor "sun bled gold" slightly risks mixing vehicles with the story's established texture of light and stone, but it is a hairline slip that does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is highly vivid and concise, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor flaw exists in a brief template cadence ("He was the mailman here, but not just any mailman: a disputed territory mailman..."), but it does not harm closure clarity or cause significant momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences describing the carousel ("peeling paint and splintered wood"), but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with varied rhythm and high information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, enhancing clarity rather than muddying it. There are no loops, scaffolds, or register drifts to detract from the momentum or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythm. A minor flaw: the phrase "unassumingly bold" is told rather than shown, and the climax has a hint of therapy-speak ("a profound release"). However, these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle are present. The opening and closing lines are particularly strong, anchoring voice and resolving with a charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exceptional, with high information density and vivid, precise imagery. Sentence-level rhythm is controlled and purposeful. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a template cadence in the sentence: "He was a perceptive map framer, trained to see borders where others saw blankness, but this tear defied logic—it wasn’t a geographical divide so much as a threshold." The structure is slightly formulaic ("trained to see X where others saw Y, but Z").

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly polished with zero loops or scaffold. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("time seemed to pool in the silence"). The final paragraph's cadence shift ("And in the end, that was enough") is perfectly executed, landing the closure with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. Minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "driftingly alert," but the figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful. There is high information density and zero scaffolding or loop artifacts, ensuring clear propulsion to the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs. A slight tendency toward decorative phrasing ("sparkled like starlight") and a single potential filter verb ("her mind raced") in a high-pressure beat prevents a top score, but no loops or scaffolds obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potentially decorative phrasing ("dusty starlight of belief") in the penultimate paragraph prevents a higher score, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent rhythmic control and sensory detail. Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. There is a single, minor instance of telling ("Kael hated them") that slightly interrupts the immersive flow, but it is an isolated moment in otherwise impeccable line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose is pristine, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "The braided ravine carved its way through the foothills" do multiple jobs, establishing setting, tone, and theme. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles.

Rhythm is masterfully controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and vivid, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats ("spiderwebbed with fractures that mirrored the chaos in his own thoughts"), creating a slight figurative pile-up, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop ("seeds of vigilance" and "faint sparks of awareness" in the first paragraph) and a single instance of a slightly mixed metaphor ("its teeth biting into her palm like a promise").

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A single, minor artifact: a near-paraphrase loop ("The grove began to change. The alders grew denser... The moss on the stump thickened...") slightly dulls momentum but does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive with excellent rhythm. Minor figurative muddle occurs in the climax ("kaleidoscope of memories" slightly abstracts the embodied experience). A single paraphrase loop ("confusion was a solvent for certainty") is present but does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. A minor loop exists in the climax: "he understood" summarizes the earned realization shown by the sapling’s growth and whispers. This slight scaffold dulls the peak beat’s immediacy but does not break closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight template cadence exists in adjacent sentences starting with "The" in the first paragraph, and the phrase "sickening lurch" borders on a bodily cliché, though it is quickly anchored in the conceptual revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, though occasional dense metaphors ("time's unraveling tapestry") slightly obscure immediacy. No loops or scaffold issues. Rhythm varies naturally, with sentence structures supporting emotional beats. Minor figurative stacking in peak beats prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor register drift occurs in the peak beat with phrases like "total internal reflection" and "liquid night," which, while conceptually apt, slightly clash with the otherwise consistent lyrical lexicon, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor instance of potential synonym churn exists ("quietly explosive" / "iridescent caution" in close proximity), but it does not obscure sense or momentum and is outweighed by overall precision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of potential scaffold in "transforming chaos into order, sorrow into light," which slightly paraphrases the core concept. However, this is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure or causality, and the prose is otherwise propulsive and artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but a tendency toward stacked figurative language creates minor density issues in high-pressure beats (e.g., "fruit that glowed like captured stars—plums of molten gold, pears that dripped liquid twilight"). This slightly slows momentum without fully obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with strong rhythm. A minor paraphrase loop occurs ("felt both out of place and oddly at home" / "felt seen") and the phrase "enlarged tranquility" is slightly elevated for the POV, but these do not significantly harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero loops or scaffolding. Figurative language ("leaves unfurling like green flames") is precise, purposeful, and never muddled. Syntax and rhythm are varied and propel the narrative forward. The final line is a masterclass in concision and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is elegant and dense, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences restating frustration ("Frustration gnawed at her. She’d spent years..."). A single template cadence run ("She sampled the blue frequency next, then green") slightly dulls momentum but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density, varied syntax, and clear propulsion. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("her voice like shattered glass"). A single, minor artifact is a slightly clunky phrase ("stubbornness with a thesaurus") which briefly punctures the narrative voice but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and propel the narrative forward. Figurative language is coherent and vivid, without mixed metaphors. A minor instance of potential register drift exists ("terrestrially cosmic" feels slightly academic for Kael's lexicon), but it is a hairline slip that does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "charcoal-fingered" establishes his profession and his stifled state). A minor artifact: the phrase "auroral sorrow" is slightly ornamental and risks register drift, though it is consistent with the lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong momentum. One minor flaw: the metaphor "like poisoned honey" is slightly at odds with the story's ultimate theme of truth as nourishment, creating a subtle coherence issue. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and information-dense without scaffold or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. There is a minor risk of overwriting in phrases like "symphonies of truth" and "liquid light," but the figurative language remains coherent and serves the voice. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, and the closing paragraph is particularly strong.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong information density. Minor artifacts include a slight template cadence in "The static was still there, but now it felt like a reminder, not a burden" and its later reprise, and the phrase "strangely organic" which leans toward label-speak. These do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The air smelled of damp earth and old paper" establishes setting and tone). A very minor instance of scaffold phrasing ("Clara’s curiosity burned") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in the opening simile ("as a spider spins its web—methodical, patient, threading...") and the cliché "pulse quickened." Otherwise, line-level craft is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely clean, vivid, and propulsive with high information density. However, minor line-level artifacts prevent a top score. The phrase "gleaming silence" is repeated verbatim in the final paragraph, creating a slight template cadence. A synonym loop occurs with "memories" and "fragments" in close succession during the climax, creating a small repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. However, a pattern of repetitive stems emerges: "smoothed hush" (3x), "flow/flowed" (3x in key beats), and "terrestrially cosmic" (2x). This synonym churn and slight template cadence, while not fatal, dulls the closure image's clarity and prevents a higher band score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery ("wisteria vines curled around wrought-iron benches"). Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs. A single minor artifact: the phrase "a low vibration that made his teeth ache" uses a common visceral cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally exceptional with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor prose artifact exists: the phrase "tragically radiant" is repeated, creating a slight synonym-loop effect with "charmed skeptic" that feels more decorative than driven. This does not significantly harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control that propels the narrative. There is a single minor instance of potential register elevation in "practiced her treason with a calligrapher’s precision," which, while voice-motivated, slightly contrasts the gritty physicality of the subsequent lines. However, this does not obscure clarity or harm the closure, and the prose remains largely free of artifacts, loops, or muddled metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is richly textured and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("reed-blown melancholy" / "melancholy swelling") and a filter-verb stack ("Kael felt the canyon sing back") in the high-pressure closure beat, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Figurative language ("flickering shadows that danced like ghosts") is pattern-taught and enhances atmosphere. Minor ornamentation in phrases like "borrowed starlight" slightly inflates texture but doesn't obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery ("harbor lights flickered like drowsy fireflies"). Minor deduction for a single potential coherence strain in "the demure audacity of it all," which slightly risks abstraction in a peak beat, though it is quickly grounded by the subsequent concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong, vivid, and propulsive. Minor deduction for some overwriting in descriptive passages (e.g., "miniature suns," "fingers grasping for an unseen force") which, while evocative, slightly slows early momentum. The climax and closure beats, however, are executed with clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax that accelerates with the storm's intensity. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a minor artifact occurs: "fractured hymn" and "fractured radio waves" create a slight synonym loop. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs, such as the portico framing chaos and being a prism. The final paragraph's propulsion is slightly hampered by one declarative sentence, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly crafted with vivid, specific diction and strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts appear: the triple revision of the verse (a synonym loop) and a slight register drift in "positively wistful" feel slightly ornamental. These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score. Information density is otherwise high, and momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and rhythm that accelerates during the conflict. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("horizon bled tangerine," "edges flickering like a broken film reel"). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptionally dense and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of potential scaffold in "not in fear, but in anticipation," but it is a hairline slip that does not obscure clarity or momentum. Figurative language is precise and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent with the voice. A minor syntactic template cadence is detected in a short run of "She [verb]" constructions in the second paragraph, triggering a small deduction. Otherwise, the line-level craft is strong and supports the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language ("vibrant hush," "apology in metal") is effective and purposeful. A single minor loop exists ("patient and ominous" describing the storm feels slightly decorative), but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.2)
    High information density without loops or scaffold. Figurative language purposeful ("skeletal frame of whirring gears"). Sentence-level propulsion varies with scene needs (short sentences during climax). No register drift or template cadence issues.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good information density. Minor scaffold phrases appear ("her eyes brightly attentive," "pulse quickening"), and a few metaphors feel slightly mixed ("sea of data streams," "echo of forgotten songs"). No major artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, avoiding muddle. A single, minor artifact exists: the phrase "calmly intuitive" is used twice, creating a slight label-like echo that doesn't fully embody the trait in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. "The fold in patience, she’d come to think of it, was the space between action and acceptance" is a standout line of precise, evocative compression.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density ("its lacquered wood glowing like trapped sunlight"). Sentences vary in length and structure to create a rhythmic, read-aloud cadence that supports the contemplative mood. There are no loops, scaffolds, or mixed metaphors. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and enhances clarity, particularly in the peak beats of dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and purposeful, with high information density. There is a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing (e.g., "a sound like wind chimes") that, while not obscuring clarity, slightly softens the line-level precision in a few spots, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. There is a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing in a few spots (e.g., "green fingers feeling for the sky"), but it is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity or momentum. Information density is high, and the closure image is sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. No significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected. Sentence-level propulsion is strong and varies effectively with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor prose artifact appears: a near-paraphrase loop occurs with "the sound of growing older" described twice in quick succession ("low, resonant hum" / "low, steady vibration") in the climax, slightly dulling the impact of the revelation. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and vivid with strong momentum, advancing story and character simultaneously. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent (e.g., "clung to the mountainside like a silver shell"). Minor scaffold exists in the phrase "Elias’s hands trembled" which slightly restates the prior "shallow gasps," but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity, though a minor figurative muddle exists ("pulsing stillness" is slightly contradictory). Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or register drift to obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is clear, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Rhythm varies effectively, particularly in the climactic paragraph. A minor instance of potential telling ("satisfying click") and a slightly stacked modifier ("cascade of light") prevent a higher score, but no artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and consistent ("certainty frayed at the edges"), and the final paragraph's cadence shift effectively lands the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. Figurative language ("mist curled like smoke") is purposeful and coherent. Minor artifact: "zephyr bloom" risks preciousness but is pattern-taught and paid off. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously ("The honeyed hush deepened. Lila realized the garden’s silence wasn’t emptiness but a container—protected vulnerability."). A single, minor artifact: the phrase "honeyed hush" is used twice, creating a slight echo that feels slightly less deliberate than other patterned repetitions.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density and rhythmic control, though slight risk of overwriting in dense metaphorical clusters (e.g., "time and truth tangled like kelp"). No loops or artifacts; propulsion remains clear, especially in the decisive closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density. Minor overwriting in early figurative language ("sunlight slanted through leaves like liquid gold") and a slight template cadence in the opening paragraph prevent a higher score, but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact exists: the phrase "a slow, deliberate cloud" following "his breath hung in the air" is a slight paraphrase loop. This does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("veined with quartz that caught the dim light like frozen starlight") is purposeful and vivid, never muddying clarity. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts were detected. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and clear propulsion. One minor figurative muddle occurs with "the grotto’s damp throat," which slightly violates the established physical logic of the setting, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with varied syntax and minimal artifacts. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("silver threads," "watercolor haze"). One minor paraphrase loop ("here and gone" repeated) occurs but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. Minor deduction for a slight tendency toward lushness in phrases like "bruised violet and electric gold," which, while voice-motivated, occasionally borders on decorative density in high-pressure beats. However, it avoids scaffold, loops, and figurative muddle, maintaining clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. One notable flaw: the metaphor "a sound like wind through a forgotten city" contradicts the established enclosed, domed setting of the terminal, creating a coherence break (-0.3). Otherwise, line-level craft is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic without artifacts. Figurative language ("heart that ticked") serves character and atmosphere. Sentences propel momentum ("She would scribe clocks by day, but by night...") with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor prose artifact appears in the phrase "serene upheaval," a slightly contradictory metaphor that momentarily muddles the tone at the opening. The line-level craft is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and evocative without overwriting. Sentences like "the oceanic hush of the harbor deepened" serve multiple functions. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with discovery and slowing into the contemplative closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for occasional density in figurative language ("a language of absence, each weft a syllable in a poem she could not finish") which, while beautiful, slightly slows momentum in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward overwriting in a few phrases (e.g., "bedraggled form—a tattered velvet doublet, hair matted with cave dust, eyes sunken yet fierce—mirrored the fractured grandeur of the palace"), which, while vivid, momentarily slows momentum. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor flaw exists: a slight template cadence in "The lagoon’s water was black, fed by an underground river that carried volcanic sand..." where the sentence structure is repeated in the next line. This does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally high, with vivid, concrete language and strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward decorative phrasing in a few spots (e.g., "eyes like fractured starlight"), which creates a touch of density in high-pressure beats, though it never obscures clarity or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density and varied sentence structure. A minor instance of filter-verb stacking ("Lumin understood") in a key beat prevents a higher score. Otherwise, the language is precise, evocative, and propulsive, with no loops or scaffolding to obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. No loops or scaffold. A single minor artifact: the phrase "fiercely meditative" in a high-pressure beat introduces a slight diagnostic label, but it does not obscure clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures accelerating tension. Figurative language ("like a blackened spine") serves atmosphere without muddle. One minor paraphrase loop ("steady as she wound" / "gears' thirst for motion") but clarity remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("velveteen gloom," "cobalt silo") and a template cadence in the opening description. However, these do not obscure clarity or momentum, and the closure beat is executed with clean, impactful prose.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with varied syntax and rhythm. Figurative language is purposeful and taught ("jagged edges clawed at the horizon"). No loops, scaffolds, or muddle in peak beats. The final image lands with clarity and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences are propulsive and varied, doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The alcove, carved into the side of a cliff... was her sanctuary" establishes setting, tone, and character). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single, hairline slip: "thistled calm" is slightly ambiguous but not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat: "the ash on her hands glittering like stardust" slightly contradicts the established somber tone and material logic of charcoal, creating a small coherence artifact that prevents a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with vivid, purposeful detail and strong rhythmic variation. A minor scaffold exists in one paragraph ("Elias smiled... He dug deeper..."), creating a slight template cadence, but it does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.5)
    Exquisite line-level craft. Prose is dense, rhythmic, and propulsive without a single loop or artifact. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and heightens clarity, particularly in peak beats like the description of the first note as "a sob."

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, a minor prose artifact occurs in a peak beat: the phrase "a testament to synaptic plasticity" is a register drift into academic diction that feels slightly outside the POV's immediate embodied experience, creating a small clarity dip in an otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive with high information density ("the air hummed with a restless energy"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm varies effectively, and the final sentence lands with perfect cadence and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "inadvertently profound" feels slightly label-like and is repeated, creating a tiny loop that slightly dulls the peak beat. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements of story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and high information density. Figurative language is effective and coherent ("motivation burned fiercer," "arts were dying... like footprints in snow"). A single, minor loop exists ("thaw" is used three times in quick succession) but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. A single, minor prose artifact exists: the phrase "neatly inventive" is repeated from the first paragraph in the final line, creating a slight template cadence that slightly dulls the closure image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong sensory detail. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("pulsed like a diseased star") causes slight register drift, but clarity and momentum remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density and rhythmic propulsion that mirrors the act of dubbing. Figurative language is consistent, purposeful, and brilliantly integrated ("the sun bled into the sea"). There are no loops, scaffold, or register drift. The sentence-level craft accelerates and breathes in perfect step with the scene's needs, from the initial flat strike to the final, crashing silence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is generally excellent, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. However, a minor prose artifact occurs in the peak beat: "A cold sweat broke out on Lira’s neck" employs a slightly common template for describing fear. This small lapse in line-level originality during a pivotal moment prevents a higher score, though it does not obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density (e.g., the rosebush's petal signaling urgency). Sentences vary rhythmically, and figurative language ("gardeners of memory") serves closure. No loops or scaffold artifacts; minor register elevation ("recontextualize") fits the POV's expertise without dissonance.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing appears in "Elara Voss, a firm shore surveyor with a compass strapped to her belt and a stoically sensitive gaze," which introduces a slight expository note.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly concise with excellent momentum and information density. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. A minor artifact exists: the slightly overwrought phrase "dappled resolve" creates a small figurative muddle in a peak beat, though it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density and vivid imagery, though minor strain in "luminous torment" slightly muddles clarity at peak beat. No loops or scaffolding; prose propels momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly efficient, with excellent rhythmic control. Sentences are propulsive and often multi-tasking ("She clutched the geode crystal—a jagged, violet-hued shard she’d dug from the rubble—its edges biting into her palm like a promise"). There are no significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. A single minor artifact: "intangibly tangible" is slightly precious, but it's thematically motivated and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats (e.g., "crown of shadows," "stones themselves were holding their breath") and a template cadence in a few sentences, but these do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm and varied syntax. A minor deduction for a slight repetition of the "sieved hush" concept, which borders on ornamental in its second use, but it does not obscure closure. No loops or scaffold issues.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. A minor deduction for the slightly repetitive use of the phrase "furrowed hush" and a moment of potential register drift ("recycled mistakes into wisdom" edges toward summary). Otherwise, line-level craft is exemplary and supports momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propelled, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, with no muddled metaphors or loops. The read-aloud rhythm is excellent, and the final paragraph's cadence shift effectively supports closure without artifice.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise, vivid, and highly efficient, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. Sentences advance multiple jobs of character, setting, and plot. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("fragments of guilt that surfaced like ink in water"). A single, minor paraphrase loop exists ("read the world more carefully, to find the hidden maps") in the final paragraph, but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor instance of potential register drift ("cosmic intimacy") appears in a peak beat but does not significantly obscure clarity or harm the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs ("pooling like ink"). A minor figurative muddle occurs with "choking and bright," creating a slight contradiction in the closure beat. Otherwise, the language is precise and propulsive, supporting the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptional, with high information density, rhythmic control, and zero artifacts. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent, even in peak beats. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere with concision and momentum. Read-aloud quality is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for a slight pattern artifact: the repetitive stem "The hush..." appears in consecutive paragraphs ("The hush deepened," "The hush swelled"), creating a faint template cadence that slightly dulls the peak beat's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, minor artifacts are present, including a template cadence ("His fingers brushed...", "Kieran’s breath caught.") and the slightly mixed metaphor of a "cradle" of sparks that "ignites" a revolution. These do not seriously harm clarity but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory selection. A minor deduction for a potentially mixed metaphor ("knot" of promise) and the clustered intensity of "star dust screamed, its light blinding" in the high-pressure beat, which slightly risks clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. However, minor figurative over-density appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "like a beast in pain," "like liquid mercury," "like a heartbeat" clustered early), slightly blurring sense. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, and the final paragraph's cadence is masterful. The closure image remains perfectly clear.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clean, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentence rhythm supports the scene's tempo. A minor artifact is present in the slightly awkward phrasing "via the coded angles," which creates a small clarity dip. Otherwise, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely excellent with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A minor artifact occurs in the peak beat: the metaphor "like an earthquake" for the mental molt is a slight register drift that feels a touch overstated for the POV's established voice. This prevents a higher score, though it does not seriously obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and concise, with strong information density. Minor rhythm issues include a slight over-reliance on parenthetical asides in the opening paragraph, creating a minor hiccup in propulsion. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally precise, but occasional overwriting and mixed metaphors ("dissonance in the wind, a silence where laughter should echo") create minor artifacts. The rhythm is strong and supports the accumulative drive, though a few phrases slightly blur sense under peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent. A minor deduction for a potential synonym loop ("quiet perfection" / "rhythmically placid" / "quiet, he heard") and a single mild filter verb ("Lira watched") in a high-pressure beat.

== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in every line. The metaphorical language is not ornamental but serves as the core engine of the story, bridging Elara's past and present work. The rhythm is controlled, sentences are varied, and there are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, with evocative, precise imagery and a varied, propulsive syntax. The opening paragraph immediately establishes a high standard of prose that is maintained throughout. There are no notable scaffold phrases or redundancies; sentences are dense with meaning and sensory detail, advancing character and atmosphere simultaneously and with great economy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, particularly in its descriptions of the conservatory and Lirael's delicate work. However, the story's second half increasingly relies on summary ("Word of Lirael’s work spread. Scientists and artists visited..."), which sacrifices immediacy and propulsion. While the line-level craft is clean, this shift from showing to telling prevents the prose from maintaining its highest level of impact through to the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often evocative and clear, with strong imagery creating a memorable atmosphere. The primary flaw is the tendency toward summary and explanation in the final two paragraphs, which restate the story's themes instead of letting the final image do the work. This scaffolding dulls the impact of the closure and reads like a slight loss of confidence in the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. Word choice is precise and evocative ("hope frayed like old rope"). While generally showing over telling, a few key transitions—like the shift from donations to notes—are handled through summary where a brief scenic moment might have provided more texture.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, there is a tendency toward abstract, elevated language ("foggy lucidity," "resonant frequency") that can feel slightly generic in its poeticism. More critically, the final paragraphs contain scaffolding that explains the story's meaning, a form of conceptual redundancy that dulls the momentum of the otherwise strong ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel strenuous. Phrasing like "began to pixelate, dissolving into a swarm of fireflies" leans on familiar sci-fi/fantasy tropes, slightly dulling the otherwise unique vision.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often evocative, with strong sensory details in the opening. The rhythm and syntax are well-controlled, supporting the story's momentum. Minor weaknesses include occasional reliance on familiar similes ("a sound like a heartbeat") and slightly overwritten phrasing ("staggering grace") that prevent the line-level craft from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely flawless, with a varied sentence structure that drives momentum. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, particularly during the climax where it heightens the sensory experience without becoming overwrought. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, demonstrating high information density and a strong command of rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, but a few minor artifacts prevent a top-tier score. The repetition of "quietly savvy" feels like a narrative scaffold, and a few phrases like "a second skin" or a laugh "like wind chimes" lean toward stock imagery. While the overall quality is very high, these instances slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. The language is precise and often beautiful. The primary weakness lies in the final paragraph, which shifts from showing to telling, summarizing the character's internal change rather than allowing the final image to convey it alone. This slight scaffolding at the crucial moment dulls the impact of an otherwise sharp and polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally clean, propulsive, and features strong, memorable imagery, especially in the opening paragraphs. Word choice is precise and the rhythm is well-paced. Minor weaknesses include a few stock phrases ("smooth as poison") and a final line that, while thematically fitting, feels like a slightly boilerplate summary rather than a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative but remains clear and purposeful, avoiding the trap of overwriting. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the pacing of Mara’s work, creating a compelling momentum. Phrases like "stone teeth gnawing at the wind" and "a palimpsest of echoes" are evocative and precise, demonstrating high-level craft with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or clashing metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum. The language is precise and generally avoids clutter. However, a few phrases like "pulsed with emotional residue, the raw material of thought" and the scientist's laugh being "like wind chimes" dip into familiar genre conventions. These moments slightly soften the otherwise crisp and specific prose, creating minor register drift that keeps it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with strong sensory details and a measured rhythm. Sentences like "The crystal whispering forecourt shimmered under a moonless sky" establish atmosphere immediately. A few phrases feel slightly over-written or explanatory ("ambiguously clear," "The registrar’s role had expanded"), but there are no significant line-level artifacts, loops, or clutter to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often elegant, with strong opening and closing images. The rhythm is well-paced, and sentences are generally concise and purposeful. There are minor instances of labeling over showing (e.g., "her movements wisely pragmatic"), and the final paragraphs feel slightly more like summary than scene, but the overall craft is polished and free of significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally clean, concise, and often elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("thinning like taffy"). Momentum is well-maintained, particularly during the high-pressure recalibration sequence. Minor deductions are for occasional moments where complex concepts are delivered in dense expository phrases, slightly interrupting the otherwise smooth narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong, specific imagery like the cello bow's "strings glistening like spider silk." However, a few instances of abstract telling ("Clara’s motivation crystallized," "The wordless conversation...grew more urgent") interrupt the immersive showing. These moments slightly reduce the overall momentum and immediacy of an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently strong, characterized by high information density and evocative, precise language ("mustache like frost," "metallic tang of a swallowed truth"). While the figurative language is dense, it rarely feels overwritten, instead contributing to the story’s rich, sorrowful atmosphere. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, carrying the reader through Lirael’s internal shifts with grace and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and propulsive, with a strong opening and excellent rhythm throughout. Word choice is largely precise and evocative. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraph, where the phrase "felt heavier now" leans on a familiar trope for symbolic weight, slightly dulling the sharpness of an otherwise powerful closing image. The initial character description also feels a bit too much like a direct summary.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical and precise for most of the story. However, the final paragraph contains a minor flaw with the sentence, "The regenerative silence had done its work," which summarizes the outcome rather than letting the subsequent images and actions carry the full weight of the change. This small moment of telling in a crucial spot slightly dulls an otherwise stellar finish.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often lovely and evocative ("notes spiraled upward, soft as moth wings"). However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts, such as the repetition of the phrase "softly adaptive" and the framing device "beneath the hush of dreaming roots." Some descriptions, like a laugh being "a sound like wind chimes," lean on cliché, slightly dulling the otherwise specific and atmospheric line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its imagery ("pages curled like dying leaves"). The rhythm is generally varied and serves the story's quiet, deliberate momentum. While the quality is very high, a few passages lean towards being slightly overwritten, with figurative language stacked a little too densely, which slightly impedes the otherwise excellent forward propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and propulsive, with high information density. However, the opening paragraph relies on a stack of similes ("like a silver blade," "steady as a heartbeat") that, while evocative, borders on overwriting. A few phrases, like "Accidentally prophetic, as always," feel slightly too self-aware. Despite these minor instances of stylistic excess, the line-level craft is overwhelmingly clear, concise, and effective, particularly in the story's second half.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening descriptions. However, the story relies on a repetitive sentence structure for its central thematic declarations ("Stillness is a thread," "Stillness is not emptiness," "Stillness is not a cage"). While this creates a liturgical, incantatory effect that fits the character, it also functions as a conceptual scaffold that feels slightly mechanical by the third repetition, dulling the propulsion of an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are moments where the figurative language becomes overly dense, and a few phrases verge on thematic summary rather than dramatization (e.g., "a architect of memories, a conductor of ghosts"). These instances slightly reduce momentum but do not obscure the clarity of the pivotal beats or the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally elegant and concise, with strong imagery like "between the drop of the rain and the ripple it left." However, a few phrases disrupt the flow. The term "procedural generation" is a jarring piece of technical jargon that clashes with the story's otherwise mythic tone. Additionally, the final paragraph contains some conceptual redundancy, summarizing the thematic insight that the preceding action had already dramatized more effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with strong rhythm and imagery, particularly in the first half. The line-level craft successfully builds the story's unique atmosphere. Momentum is slightly undercut by the switch from scene to summary late in the story, and a few phrases lean towards familiar emotional shorthand ("unravel even the tightest knots of numbness").

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is mostly clear but contains several jarring artifacts. The phrase "credibly curious" is awkward, "progressing laterally" is jargonistic, and "intuit" is a grammatical error. The recorder's ability to detect "lies in the air's composition" is a significant tonal and logical inconsistency, a moment of overwriting that breaks the established world rules for a flourish.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong sensory details that build the atmosphere effectively ("hummed with a quiet, almost sacred energy," "prismatic streaks"). Momentum is well-maintained through the rising action. The primary flaw is in the final section, where sentences become more declarative and summary-focused, slightly slowing the rhythm and creating minor redundancy as the story explains its own conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, with strong verbs and imagery. However, it occasionally tips into overwriting, with figurative language that feels more decorative than functional. The final two sentences, while thematically important, sacrifice momentum for summary, slightly dulling the impact of the final, potent image of the spiral.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. The line-level craft is mostly excellent, with high information density. The score is capped due to a paraphrase loop in the final paragraph, which summarizes the thematic and emotional resolution that the preceding scene had already powerfully dramatized, slightly dulling the final image’s momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, but it is hampered by minor overwriting and a significant structural flaw in the closing. The final paragraph contains a clear paraphrase loop, restating the motivation to "fuse insight with empathy" that was already established. This redundancy weakens the ending, making it feel summarized rather than concluded. While generally strong, such artifacts prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("her heels crunching gravel," "haphazard towers" of books). The sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the story's momentum. There are no significant prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies. The craft is clean and professional, contributing significantly to the story's atmosphere and emotional impact.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative and precise imagery ("pooled like liquid mercury," "cast fractured rainbows"). The prose maintains momentum and clarity. The primary weakness is a tendency towards uniform density; the high lyrical register is maintained throughout, which can feel slightly overwrought in moments that might benefit from a plainer style for contrast. This lack of modulation is a minor but noticeable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and propulsive, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, enhancing the atmosphere without overwriting. While one or two phrases border on cliché (e.g., "mind raced"), these are minor and do not detract from the overall polish. There are no loops, scaffolding, or artifacts to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("chittering," "plink," "winked through a veil of grief"). The rhythm of the sentences supports the story's meditative, ritualistic pace. A minor weakness lies in a few phrases like "the mathematics of emotion" and "the loss wasn’t a void but a fractal," which feel slightly more academic than the established voice and risk telling an abstraction that the surrounding concrete details are already showing.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, with strong imagery and a consistent rhythm. However, some phrases lean towards cliché ("long, trembling shadows") or self-conscious lyricism ("sapphire hush," used twice). There are instances of scaffolding, such as summarizing a shift with “Mara’s motivation crystallized,” which tells the reader what to feel instead of letting the action carry the weight.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally clean with strong, evocative imagery at the sentence level. However, the piece is hampered by the repetition of key thematic phrases ("releasing control," "reconstructing," "circuitously sincere"). While initially effective, this recurrence becomes a kind of template cadence by the end, feeling more mechanical than lyrical and slightly dulling the momentum of the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and polished, demonstrating strong rhythmic control and high information density. Lines like "the grain of forgotten laughter" showcase an excellent command of imagery. The piece is clean, with no significant loops or syntactic monotony. The only minor weakness is the thematic note, which functions as a prose shortcut, summarizing what the final painting is meant to show.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the cave, demonstrating strong rhythm and information density. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward. There is a minor reliance on familiar fantasy phrasing ("rumble of distant thunder," "cloak woven from starlight") that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp and specific imagery, preventing it from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often evocative, particularly in the opening description of the harbor. However, the momentum is occasionally slowed by abstract nominalizations and jargon that feel imposed on the narrative ("reactively visionary approach"). The line "Lirael’s hearten strategy" is a notable clunky artifact that momentarily breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often lyrical, with strong verbs and specific imagery that build a compelling atmosphere ("skeletal remains," "walls slick with condensation"). The momentum is well-paced. Some key conceptual phrases, such as "fortress of unspoken truths" and "hour that divides bad habits and new starts," verge on being overly abstract and feel slightly ungrounded compared to the story's otherwise concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong imagery and rhythm. There are no significant text artifacts or momentum-killing sentences. A few phrases, such as "courageously kind" or the direct description of courage "seeping" into her, feel slightly less sharp and more like telling than the otherwise high-level showing throughout the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong verbs and striking imagery ("fractured rainbow," "jagged shadows that danced like spies"). The sentences are well-constructed with a varied rhythm that propels the narrative forward. While the language is ambitious and occasionally verges on ornate ("defiant moon"), it remains coherent and serves the story's heightened, fantastical tone without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity at pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum effectively through the scene. Sentence structure is varied and professional. The main weakness lies in the final paragraphs, which contain some summary and thematic telling that feels less crafted than the sharp, image-driven prose at the story's start. There are no significant line-level artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong opening imagery. There are, however, minor slips into slightly overwrought phrasing ("dizzying dance," "torrent of invented histories that seemed to write themselves") that momentarily break the carefully crafted restraint. The final sentence, a list of abstract concepts, feels less sharp and concrete than the prose that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is largely evocative and precise, but it falters significantly in the final paragraphs. The line "The answer came in a whisper, carried on the wind. A name. A face. A motive" is a critical misstep. It's an unearned leap of intuition that replaces the story's established method of discovery (finding physical clues) with a convenient, told summary, undermining the story's causal integrity and momentum at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled, demonstrating high information density without feeling overwritten. Word choice is precise and evocative, contributing significantly to the atmosphere. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every sentence serves to advance the story's purpose with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, concise, and carries strong momentum. Opening descriptions are evocative and efficient ("fried dough and diesel"). While there are minor instances of similar sentence structures in the opening reflective paragraphs, the prose is otherwise sharp and free of artifacts, particularly in the high-pressure confrontation scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, creating a strong sense of atmosphere with remarkable efficiency. The line-level craft is clean, with varied syntax and strong verbs propelling the narrative forward. There are no notable textual artifacts or loops. The writing demonstrates a high degree of polish, with the only minor critique being a few phrases in the final paragraphs that lean toward the abstract ("archives of time") where the story's power has otherwise been in its concrete specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly effective, with strong verbs and specific, evocative imagery. There are no wasted words or distracting artifacts; sentences have a high information density and propel the narrative forward smoothly. The rhythm modulates effectively between the tension of the repair and the calm of the resolution. The final line is a perfect cadence, locking in the story's tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, marked by concision, evocative imagery, and a compelling rhythm. Sentences are information-dense and propel the narrative forward. The final line, "And somewhere, a falcon laughed," is a stylistic risk; it's a slightly jarring tonal shift into the whimsical that detracts from the powerful, grounded mystery established earlier. While the prose is otherwise excellent, this final flourish feels like a small misstep in an otherwise masterfully controlled piece.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, it occasionally relies on dense adjectival piling and list-like sentences that, while atmospheric, approach a template cadence. The primary flaw is the final section's shift into summary, where the prose abandons scene work to explain the theme, causing a loss of momentum and immediacy just before the end.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and rich with sensory detail without becoming overly ornate. Sentence structure is varied, maintaining propulsion throughout. There are a few moments where figurative language feels slightly familiar ("coiled like eels," "jagged as shattered glass"), but the overall execution is strong and free of distracting artifacts or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong verbs and striking images. However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, occasionally feeling overwrought (e.g., the repeated "copperlight repose"). A subtle template cadence emerges in some paragraphs (e.g., "Elias's boots scuffed... Elias's throat tightened..."), a minor artifact that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and imagistic, with many memorable phrases ("shadows pooled like ink," "gown, woven from the threads of a thousand funerals"). However, it occasionally tips into overwriting, and the repetition of the key phrase "mournful elation" feels like a slight crutch. The sentence-level craft is generally strong, but the momentum is often stalled by long blocks of exposition rather than propelled by in-scene action.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the prose is saturated with figurative language, which at times risks becoming overwriting and slightly dulls the momentum through its sheer density. A few moments of plainer, more direct prose during key actions would have provided powerful contrast and heightened the impact of the more lyrical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a confident rhythm. However, a few moments rely on familiar phrasing that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution. Phrases like "pulsed like a heartbeat" and "mind alight with possibilities" are minor clichés that stand out against the more original imagery of the bone-orchard, preventing the line-level craft from reaching flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, clear, and evocative, with strong opening imagery ("honeyed streaks across cobblestone floors"). There are no significant prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting. However, the piece lacks the sentence-level propulsion or striking figurative language that would elevate it to an exceptional level. It is highly competent and professional, but the execution remains safely within established conventions rather than taking risks that might create a truly memorable texture.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong, evocative imagery and varied sentence rhythms. Figurative language, such as "needles darted like comets," is consistently well-integrated and purposeful. The piece avoids clutter and scaffolding, maintaining momentum toward its revelatory conclusion. A few phrases like "sound like wind chimes" are slightly clichéd, but these are minor slips in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery that creates momentum. There are minor instances of near-overwriting where emotion is slightly labeled ("a paradox that made her throat tighten"). The final sentence, "And so she did," is a small but notable flaw, as it is a common summarizing trope that breaks from the specific, imagistic mode that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. The sentence-level craft is superb, with a varied rhythm that supports the story's contemplative momentum. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, consistently reinforcing character and theme ("The mist curled... like a ghost's fingers," "The dark is just the world holding its breath"). The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts; every line contributes to the whole, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and highly effective piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and polished, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are occasional moments of overwriting where the figurative language feels more performative than immersive, such as describing the display's effect as a "reckless, pensive mirth." While technically adept, such phrases read as authorial summary rather than flowing from the character's immediate perception, creating a slight distance that holds the prose back from flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. The rhythm is well-paced and supports the building tension of the experiment. The score is slightly capped by a few instances of overly abstract or writerly phrasing, such as "that liminal space where curiosity outweighs certainty," which feel more like authorial summary than Marisol's immediate perception.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, but it occasionally indulges in overwriting that verges on purple prose. The repetition of the phrase "the greenhouse’s chaos converged" is a noticeable artifact that could have been varied. While generally vivid, some descriptions rely on familiar phrasing ("pulse quickened," "lips twitched"). The line-level craft is strong but lacks the final polish of surgical concision required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is luminous, with high information density and exquisite phrasing like “reef-shadow joy.” The sentence-level propulsion is strong, matching the story’s contemplative, migratory pace. The only minor friction is the sheer density of figurative language, which, while beautiful, occasionally risks becoming overwrought, and a single abstract label (“shyly unstoppable certainty”) stands out in a story built on concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong sensory details ("prismatic whispers," "sighed into silence"). The rhythm is well-controlled and the word choice precise. Minor deductions are for a few instances of common phrasing ("her chest tightened") and a slightly precious descriptor ("foxglove regret") that momentarily breaks the otherwise seamless texture.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are moments of overwriting and summary, such as describing Elara's tone as "a blend of caution and exuberance." The final line—"a weaver of forgotten words, a restorer of broken trust"—is a self-conscious summary that slightly flattens the earned nuance of the preceding scene by stating the character's new identity too plainly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. However, it suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought, particularly in the opening. There are also minor conceptual loops, with phrases like "harmonize conflicting values" and "slyly heartfelt nature" repeated, which slightly dulls momentum. While artful, the prose could achieve greater power through more concision.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, marked by strong sensory details and evocative figurative language that rarely feels overwrought. Sentences are well-paced, creating a rhythm that mirrors the story's quiet, methodical progression. While a few minor phrases verge on scaffolding ("But this—this was different"), the overall line-level craft is of a very high quality, demonstrating clarity, concision, and a strong ear for language.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative but remains clear and purposeful, avoiding the trap of overwriting. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm, and there are no discernible scaffold phrases or loops. Every word works to build the story's unique atmosphere and advance Lira's internal state, resulting in prose with exceptional information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, but it relies on several familiar lyrical constructions ("fleeting dance," "swallowed by... time"). A key flaw is the tendency to summarize the story's thematic insight in abstract, slightly overwritten language ("grand, chaotic symphony of existence") in the final paragraphs. This feels like a scaffold left in place, dulling the impact of the otherwise strong final images.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and generally well-crafted, with strong, original imagery. However, there are minor instances of overwriting, such as figurative language that feels slightly stock ("as if answering the seed’s silent question"). Some sentences summarize emotional states rather than embodying them, creating a slight distance. The overall quality is high, but a final polish would tighten these few moments and increase momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean and often features strong, evocative imagery. The primary flaw at the line-level is the conceptual redundancy—the key phrase "orchestrate serendipity by ordering randomness" is repeated, and the final analytical paragraph summarizes what was just dramatized. These loops and scaffolding artifacts dull the momentum and impact of an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, polished, and purposeful, with high information content in every line. Figurative language is rich but remains coherent and tethered to the story's internal logic, avoiding overwriting. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the flow of Lirael's dance, creating a propulsive yet graceful momentum from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, the final two paragraphs contain a paraphrase loop that summarizes the thematic insight just experienced. Lines like "a way to see the world with clear complexity" and "illumination was not about grand revelations" restate the same conclusion, creating a slight drag and redundancy where a resonant image would have been more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and concrete imagery. However, there are occasional slips into overwriting or cliché ("a face only a mirror could love," "celestial bodies pirouetted"). Some phrasing feels slightly redundant, like "enlighten himself—by reflecting deeply," which momentarily disrupts the otherwise confident momentum. These minor artifacts prevent a higher score but do not obscure the story's core clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with vivid, purposeful figurative language ("saltwater pooled like liquid mercury," "mind a lattice of observations"). Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that supports the story’s "serene upheaval." There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or momentum with exceptional clarity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong, varied rhythm. While the figurative language is often brilliant ("curved like a question mark"), it occasionally becomes so dense that it slightly impedes momentum. A minor redundancy like "sensitively perceptive" stands out in an otherwise polished piece, preventing a higher score, but the overall craft is of a very high caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong rhythm. The imagery is vivid and purposeful. A few minor phrases, such as "perceptively calm" and "a study in grace," read as slight prose artifacts that are less sharp than the surrounding text, preventing a higher score but not detracting from the overall momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is polished and often evocative. However, there are noticeable prose artifacts in the form of conceptual loops. The key phrase "the price of redemption" is repeated three times, and "the slow dance of celestial bodies" appears twice. This repetition, while thematic, functions as a scaffold that slightly dulls the momentum and information density required for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished, confident, and highly evocative, demonstrating exceptional information density in every line. The rhythm is controlled, shifting from languid description to sharp, decisive action without a single misstep. Figurative language, such as the river's "ghost" and the "language of loss," is fresh and integral to the story's meaning, not ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with figurative language stacked so densely that it occasionally slows momentum and blurs clarity. While many images are beautiful in isolation, their sheer volume becomes an artifact. The line-level craft is also marred by the tonal clash of "a middle finger," a register drift that signals a lack of authorial control at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its descriptions of the setting and the puppet show. Word choice is precise and syntax is varied to control momentum. The piece is held back from a higher score by a few phrases that feel slightly overwritten or self-conscious, such as "meteor hush," which pulls attention to the prose itself rather than the image.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, it is marred by moments of repetition and a final sentence that is tonally incongruous and cliché. The phrase "interrupted cadence" appears twice in close succession to describe different things, feeling like a forced echo. The line-level craft is strong but lacks the final polish of a flawless piece, primarily due to the sentimental and stylistically inconsistent final thought.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, a few minor artifacts detract from its polish. The phrase "technically gentle" is repeated verbatim in a short piece, making it conspicuous. Additionally, the final sentence functions as unnecessary scaffolding, explaining the story's point rather than letting the final image do the work, which slightly dulls the story's momentum at the very end.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences generally have high information density and good rhythmic variety. A minor weakness is a slight tendency towards abstract, high-concept phrasing that can feel a touch overwritten, such as "nexus of decay and renewal," but it doesn't significantly impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Sentences like "Every coin saved was a shield against the void’s indifference" establish character and theme with concise power. While the craft is consistently high, a few moments of slight over-explanation ("The irony wasn’t lost on her...") function as minor scaffolding that could have been removed to trust the reader more fully.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains a steady rhythm. However, it occasionally relies on abstract emotional language ("a whisper of release") and conceptual summaries where more concrete, embodied description would be stronger. There are no significant technical flaws, but the language lacks the specificity and sharpness needed to elevate it, often choosing to explain the magic rather than evoke its feeling through sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong rhythm and evocative imagery. However, a few moments slip into telling rather than showing, such as the line explaining that synchronized breathing "began to erase the boundaries." While generally concise, some phrases like "harmony of intention" feel slightly abstract compared to the story's more concrete sensory details, momentarily thinning the otherwise immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. The rhythm and syntax support the story's contemplative pace. The final paragraphs, however, exhibit some minor repetitive sentence structures ("She’d done it. She’d mended... She’d mended...") and a shift into summary that slightly dulls the momentum established by the strong scene work preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence serving character, atmosphere, or plot. Figurative language, such as a letter "singed as if burned by a comet’s tail," is evocative without becoming overwrought. The rhythm is well-paced, and there are no significant prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding to impede momentum, resulting in a clean and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, with strong imagery like the guardian woven from book spines. There are minor instances of scaffolding and telling over showing (e.g., "carefully resourceful by nature," "motivation had crystallized then") that slightly soften the momentum. The final paragraph leans more towards summary than resonant image, which holds it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative for the most part, with strong verbs and concrete imagery. However, a few moments slip into summary, slightly diluting the impact of the discovery. Lines like "She’d found the garden of forgotten names... by unraveling the threads of others’ lives" explain the theme rather than letting the prior actions fully embody it, which feels like a minor scaffolding left in place near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and largely free of artifacts. Sentences are well-constructed and maintain momentum, particularly in the action sequences. There are minor instances of slightly overwritten phrasing ("as if the very metal yearned to tell a story") and some expository sentences are less elegant than others. Overall, the line-level craft is strong and professional, serving the story without drawing undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is a significant strength, marked by high information density, striking figurative language (“living static,” “joy a razor-edged thing”), and a varied, musical rhythm. Sentences are concise and propulsive, with virtually no scaffolding or redundancy. The line-level craft is clean and sophisticated, creating a textured and immersive reading experience without becoming overwrought or obscuring clarity, even during the peak mystical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its imagery ("shattered panes rattled like skeletal wind chimes"). The line-level craft is strong, with varied syntax and a clear rhythm that propels the narrative. There are no significant loops or artifacts, though the final few paragraphs shift to a slightly more abstract, summary-like register which slightly softens the landing.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and striking imagery ("gelatinous sheen," "poured milk"). However, a few key moments at the climax rely on summary over dramatization, such as "She smiled, understanding now." This tendency to state the character's realization, rather than allowing the final images to convey it entirely, slightly dulls the propulsive force of an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and strong sentence-level propulsion. Word choice is excellent, particularly in the sensory descriptions. A slight tendency toward lush, stacked descriptors ("roaring, golden radiance") very occasionally borders on overwriting but largely serves the fantastical tone without impeding clarity or momentum in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong sensory details ("the tide’s breath painted the walls in silver"). The rhythm is controlled and serves the story's quiet, observant mood. A minor weakness is a moment of over-explanation in her internal monologue ("she realized it was also to bridge the gaps between people"), which feels slightly less organic than the surrounding prose.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often evocative and rhythmically controlled, particularly in the descriptive passages. However, the final two paragraphs contain prose artifacts that dull the impact. The construction "She smiled, realizing that..." and "She’d learned that..." are scaffolding templates that summarize insight rather than dramatizing it, slightly cheapening the story's potent final image.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but its consistently high density of figurative language borders on overwriting. Phrases like "liquid fractals" and "whistle's death throes" are striking but, when stacked so closely, threaten to draw more attention to the language itself than to the story's emotional current. A slight reduction in ornamental description would increase the propulsion and impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is largely strong, with evocative imagery and clean syntax. However, the inexplicable inclusion of the Chinese character “揭去 (peel)” is a jarring and unprofessional artifact that breaks immersion and mars an otherwise polished piece. This significant line-level flaw necessitates a substantial deduction from what would have been a high-scoring category.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmically controlled, creating a strong mood. However, there are minor but noticeable instances of text looping and overwriting. Phrases like "hold the line, but lately, the line had started to blur" and the density of abstract emotional descriptors slightly dull the momentum. While generally strong, the line-level craft could be sharpened for greater concision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong opening and closing images. Lines like “spores had been mutating into crystalline structures, sharp as regret” demonstrate high-level craft. There is, however, a slight tendency toward conceptual labels (“conceptual pressure,” “quantum promise device”) that feel a bit like placeholders for deeper mechanics. The climax contains a short run of simple declarative sentences that, while creating a certain rhythm, slightly reduces syntactic complexity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery like "the sepia reading room swallowed the last sliver of sunlight." Momentum is strong through the climax. The final two paragraphs, however, slip into summary, using phrases like "what she’d found was a legacy of sacrifice" which tell rather than show, slightly dulling the impact of an otherwise powerful ending by explaining the revelation that was just dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and clean for the most part, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a few moments rely on telling shortcuts, such as "Cedric’s motivation crystallized." The final paragraph, while thematically resonant, leans into direct statement, slightly flattening the prose at the very end by explaining the insight he has just embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise. However, a few moments hold it back from the highest tier. A template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph ("He imagined a soldier... He imagined that soldier... And then he imagined a child..."), which slightly flattens the rhythm. Phrasing like "broken-hearted archivist" and a button carrying "the weight of a secret" lean toward familiar cliché, momentarily diluting the otherwise specific and evocative language.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, propulsive, and demonstrates high information density. Word choice is largely strong and evocative (“steel vultures,” “searing their retinas”). While a few phrases verge on the conventional (“Jax’s eyes widened”), there are no significant line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting that impede momentum, especially during the critical closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and highly crafted, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. The sentence structure varies to control pace, and information density is high. The only minor weakness is that the figurative language, while beautiful, occasionally becomes so dense that it verges on being overwrought, slightly slowing momentum in the opening paragraphs. However, this is a matter of taste, and clarity is never compromised, especially during the crucial climax where the prose remains sharp and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, with high information density in every sentence. Figurative language is fresh and integrated ("branches twisted like ancient veins") rather than ornamental. There are no wasted words, scaffolding, or rhythmic monotony; the read-aloud quality is excellent, and the syntax modulates to match the story's quiet, deliberate pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates high information density without becoming overwrought. Sentence structure and rhythm vary effectively to match the story's momentum, from the contemplative opening to the chaotic plunge. There are no significant loops or scaffolding, and the language is precise, though a few phrases like "Uncertainly certain" lean heavily on the theme rather than pure description.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with vivid imagery and concise descriptions. Momentum is well-maintained. A few phrases like “factually mystical blend” and “kintsugi intentions” feel slightly self-conscious or overly constructed, briefly pulling the reader out of the otherwise seamless narrative texture. These are minor but noticeable artifacts in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with a strong rhythm and high information density in its imagery. Figurative language is rich without becoming overwrought, effectively building atmosphere and mood. The final paragraph, while thematically explicit, is still cleanly written, but the story's momentum is slightly dulled by this shift from showing to explaining, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, precise, and evocative, with a strong, varied rhythm. Word choice is excellent, balancing abstract concepts with concrete sensory detail without overwriting. There are no notable loops, redundancies, or other prose artifacts; every sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere and internal state with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is rich with imagery and demonstrates strong command of language, especially in the opening. However, it frequently borders on being overwritten, with dense clusters of figurative language and abstract concepts that can feel ungrounded. The final paragraphs also suffer from conceptual redundancy, restating the core theme in slightly different ways, which dulls momentum at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and clean for the most part, with strong imagery. However, a few minor instances of telling what has already been shown slightly undermine the craft. Phrases like "The patterns weren’t random; they told a story" and the redundant "his skillfully observant eyes" are small but noticeable slips that prevent a higher score under the rubric's demanding standards.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often lyrical, creating a vivid and immersive texture. Sentence structure and rhythm are well-controlled, particularly during the escalating climax. While the high density of figurative language is mostly effective, a few moments border on cliché ("alight with terror and wonder"). The final two paragraphs shift slightly into a more summary-like mode, telling the results of the transformation rather than grounding them in a final, concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is clean, dense, and purposeful. Sentences are crafted for both clarity and rhythm, with strong verbs and specific, evocative imagery. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The story strategically compresses time ("The dispute raged for weeks") where needed to maintain momentum, a mark of excellent craft at this length. The language is sophisticated without ever feeling strained, perfectly matching the story's tone.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language is consistently high, bordering on overwritten in a few moments ("syrup of sound," "star smothered by ash"). While the tone supports this richness, a touch more restraint in key moments of pressure would have increased its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the pacing of Lira's journey, from the contemplative cataloging at the start to the tense discovery in the cavern. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; the craft is polished and serves the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose contains striking images, it is hampered by a high density of figurative language that sometimes clutters rather than clarifies. There are several instances of paraphrase loops and conceptual redundancy, particularly around the core theme. The final paragraphs, for example, restate the central idea of simplicity and complexity three times in slightly different ways, which stalls the story's final momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, with strong verbs and a varied, compelling rhythm. Information density is high, with no noticeable scaffolding or repetitive phrasing. The only minor vulnerability is the sheer density of figurative language; while generally effective, its consistent elevation borders on overwriting and slightly smooths over the texture of the character's voice under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in the opening paragraphs. Information density is high, and the language effectively builds atmosphere. A few minor stock phrases ("blood turned to ice") appear in high-pressure moments, but there are no significant loops, scaffolds, or other prose artifacts that impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it falters by summarizing the core effort ("Days passed, then weeks"), which stalls momentum where struggle should be shown. The final two sentences create a paraphrase loop, restating the core theme in slightly different terms, which dulls the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with high information density in its imagery. The rhythm supports the story's contemplative, tense atmosphere. The primary flaw is the parenthetical intrusion "(wrinkles, though he spoke the word in Old High Martian)," an awkward piece of scaffolding that disrupts momentum and clarity at a key moment of character resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. A significant flaw occurs with the introduction of the term "entropy," where the prose shifts into a clunky, pseudo-scientific register that is both tonally jarring and logically incoherent. This prose artifact at a pivotal moment undermines the narrative's authority and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clear, concise, and maintains momentum effectively. The line-level craft is strong, particularly in its description of sound and atmosphere. The score is slightly limited by moments of telling over showing (labeling Lira's curiosity) and the presence of narrative scaffolding in the final paragraphs that summarizes the character's thematic realization, slightly dulling the immediacy of the otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and polished, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, the final paragraph acts as a scaffold, summarizing the story's meaning after the true emotional climax has already occurred in the scene with Veyra, which dulls the ending's momentum. Additionally, some key concepts like "flourishing stillness" and "primal elegance" are repeated as labels rather than being fully dramatized, a minor but noticeable artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clean, with a strong rhythm and evocative imagery. However, the final sentence is a significant flaw; it functions as a scaffold that summarizes the resolution, dulling the impact of the final image. This type of thematic restatement in the closing beat is a notable drag on momentum and violates the principle of showing over telling at a critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are rhythmically varied and generally concise. However, in the central discovery beats, the figurative language ("The coil became a dancer, its loops a choreography of decay") verges on being overly poetic, momentarily pulling focus from the grounded action to a more abstract, authorial register.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. However, there are a few moments where the momentum is slightly dulled by summary-like phrasing that restates what has been dramatized. For example, "Lira had responded by tending, by weaving, by harmonizing the discord into something new" paraphrases the entire preceding scene, creating a brief scaffold-like feel before the powerful final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. Sentences are well-constructed and information-dense. A minor repetitive artifact exists in the use of the character attribute as a tag, specifically "her tone brazen calm" and later "Lira shrugged, brazen calm." While a small point, this template cadence slightly mars an otherwise polished and propulsive line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, marked by high information density, precise imagery, and rhythmic control. Figurative language, such as "eyes twin pools of liquid mercury" or "a sound like wind chimes rusted by time," is evocative without becoming overwrought. The line-level craft is flawless, with no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-structured. A minor weakness is a tendency toward evocative but slightly abstract phrasing, such as "a fertilizer mixed from memories of the reef’s final gasp," which momentarily lessens the concreteness of the action. This is a very fine point in an otherwise polished piece, but it prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often lyrical, with a controlled rhythm that supports the story's gentle, fable-like tone. However, it relies on some generic constructions ("the settlement erupted in cheers") and repetitive phrasing, notably the recurring "wild hush." While effective initially, the repetition slightly dulls its impact by the end. The sentence-level craft is solid but lacks the consistent, high-density specificity that would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, with a strong rhythm and high information density. However, a few key moments of internal realization are delivered through summary ("adriftness, he realized, was a kind of freedom") rather than pure dramatization. This slightly abstracts the emotion and prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of immediacy and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with good sentence-level propulsion during the action sequence. However, some figurative language leans on genre familiarity ("dagger of frost"). The most significant flaw is the final two paragraphs, which lapse into summary and thematic explanation, killing the momentum built during the climax and telling what should have been shown through a final, resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative figurative language ("sound curled like smoke"). Sentence structure is varied and propulsive, mirroring Elara's pacing. While the conceptual language ("nomadic penumbra") is consistently elevated, it remains coherent within the established voice and avoids devolving into abstraction, resulting in a polished and effective piece of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative and precise language ("shadows as sharp as knives," "dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies"). However, there is a slight tendency towards overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally lessens the impact of any single image. The final sentence reads more like an authorial summary than an organic conclusion emerging from the scene, a piece of scaffolding that could be removed for a sharper ending.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery like the "tableau of lives interrupted" and the "woven hush." The rhythm is well-paced and sentences are constructed with care. There are minor instances where the language feels pre-packaged, such as "winnow the truth from the lies," which reads more like a premise summary than organic narration, but these moments do not significantly detract from the overall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose contains striking, memorable images (“crooked teeth against a bruised sky”). However, the final two paragraphs shift from sharp, sensory detail into abstract summary, which dulls the immediacy of the climax. This tell-over-show tendency at the very end slightly flattens the landing by explaining the story's meaning rather than letting the final images resonate alone.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and dense with sensory detail, creating a strong atmosphere from the first sentence. Word choice is precise and the rhythm is well-paced, accelerating with the rising tension. While generally excellent, a few phrases like "silent judgment" and "storm of gold and glass" lean toward familiar conventions, and the articulation of the theme at the end feels more like scaffolding than fully integrated prose.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. However, its high density of figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting. A more significant issue is a subtle redundancy in the final paragraph, where the emotional resolution is stated, then described, then summarized thematically, slightly slowing the momentum of what should be a sharp, resonant final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with a strong rhythmic quality and precise word choice. The line-level craft is generally high, with figurative language that is both beautiful and functional. A few minor instances of stock phrasing, such as "heart pounding" or a face "crinkling like parchment," slightly dull the otherwise sharp and original imagery, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and strong imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the escalating tension of Mara's task. A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances of familiar phrasing ("skeletal fingers," "heart racing," "tears streaking her dirt-smudged cheeks") that, while functional, momentarily dip into stock description in an otherwise highly original piece. These do not touch the closure, but slightly temper the overall line-level ingenuity.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is generally clear, but a significant factual error severely damages credibility: "branches bent low under the weight of truffles." As truffles grow underground, this detail undermines the protagonist’s identity as an expert forager and breaks world consistency from the opening sentence. This is a critical flaw in line-level craft that would stop a story at a top publication.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong imagery like the boutonnière’s petals being “brittle as moth wings.” However, there are minor instances of overwriting and cliché, such as “eyes the color of storm clouds,” that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. The final paragraph feels a touch declarative, summarizing the thematic shift rather than letting the image of the lifting mist do all the work.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery creating excellent momentum. Sentences are varied and the rhythm is well-paced. The primary weakness is a slight shift toward abstraction and scaffold-like summary in the final two paragraphs ("a beacon, not a trap," "a mirror, reflecting the courage to choose"). This momentarily dulls the line-level propulsion by telling the reader the conclusion's meaning instead of letting the final action carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft of the narration is exceptional, marked by rhythmic variety, high information density, and evocative, specific imagery ("a lacy menace," "sparked like crushed glass"). The prose is clean, with no significant loops, scaffolding, or artifacts to impede momentum. Sentences are constructed with precision and a strong sense of musicality that elevates the story's atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. Sentences like “The moment hung, suspended like a moth in amber” demonstrate high craft. The primary weakness is a tendency to summarize the climactic insight in the resolution ("she’d captured the density of presence...by letting it revalue her approach"), which dilutes momentum by telling the reader what was just shown.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("sky in bruised purples and oranges"). Momentum is well-maintained, and the language is dense with meaning. A few phrases feel slightly overwrought or self-consciously literary (e.g., "distill its fractured rhythms into something resembling narrative"), but there are no significant technical flaws, loops, or distracting prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong sensory details that ground the story's conceptual framework. The rhythm is well-paced, mirroring the "trembling calm" of the shop. A few phrases, like "giving shape to what had been lost in translation," verge on explaining the subtext, a minor scaffolding that slightly dulls an otherwise sharp and evocative line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in its depiction of the tense ritual. Sentences are well-structured, and word choice is precise ("liquid starlight," "fractal patterns"). The piece avoids major artifacts, but a handful of similes trend toward the familiar ("pooled like spilled milk"), and the final, thematic summary slightly dulls the impact of the otherwise strong, image-driven prose.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and memorable images, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. Momentum is generally excellent, though it falters during the explanation of the bottle’s mechanism. This section ("The dove’s wings are copper...") reads like a necessary but clunky info-dump, disrupting the otherwise seamless and atmospheric rhythm of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is often elegant, but it leans heavily on abstract nouns and conceptual statements ("a deliberate act of unification," "a reflection of their own inner conflicts"). This tendency to 'tell' the internal process rather than showing it through concrete, sensory experience creates a slight narrative distance. There are also runs of overwriting where the language aims for profundity but lands in vagueness, slightly dulling the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by precision, concision, and a strong, rhythmic cadence. Figurative language, such as the station clinging "like a barnacle," is vivid and purposeful without ever feeling overwritten. There are no discernible prose artifacts; every sentence serves to advance atmosphere, character, or the central accumulative pressure, resulting in a piece with high information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and generally well-paced, but key moments rely on abstract summary over concrete description. Phrases like seeing things "*conceptually*" or symbols rearranging into "harmonious patterns" tell the reader the outcome instead of showing the process. There are also moments of overwriting ("smooth as mycelium threading through soil") that feel more decorative than purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is exceptional: dense, evocative, and rhythmically controlled, passing the 9+ test with ease. Lines like "his absence felt like a ledger she couldn’t balance" demonstrate high-level craft. There is zero scaffolding, redundancy, or figurative muddle; every sentence works to advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The syntax shifts appropriately from reflective and complex to short and sharp during moments of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often elegant. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting with phrases like "melodically haunted souls" that feel more decorative than precise. The primary weakness is the tendency to use conceptual language ("Cultivated estrangement") as a substitute for dramatizing a complex internal state, which slightly dulls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and efficient, with a high density of meaning in every line. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, consistently deepening atmosphere and character without ever feeling overwrought. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the syntax is varied and the rhythm is controlled to match the story's twilight mood. This is clean, confident, and stylistically sophisticated line-level craft of the highest order.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and dense with purposeful imagery, particularly in its depiction of the setting. Sentences are well-constructed with strong verbs and specific nouns, creating momentum. A few figurative phrases, like "sharp as glass shards," are familiar, but this is a minor issue in an otherwise polished piece. The overall craft is clean, concise, and effective, with no significant loops or artifacts to impede clarity or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. Line-level craft is generally strong, with varied syntax and a good rhythmic flow. There is a slight tendency towards overwriting with abstract emotional descriptors ("grief and hope coiled into something quiet, something true"), which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp, concrete sensory details of the forest.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative from the first sentence, with high information density and strong, specific verbs. Figurative language, such as "warped the air like glass, bending light into prismatic shards," is both beautiful and functional. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other prose artifacts, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and a confident command of rhythm and pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic sense. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting, with stacked abstractions and figurative language that sometimes soften the impact of key moments ("a joyful sorrow—a melody that captured the beauty of loneliness, the ache of things unsaid"). The craft is strong, but a more disciplined and concrete approach would heighten the story's power.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and purposeful, with high information density and a strong, rhythmic cadence. The language is precise and evocative, especially in its descriptions of the archive and the art. A few phrases like "volcanic tenderness" and "analytically intuitive" read as authorial labels rather than emerging organically from the prose, representing minor but noticeable seams in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is often luminous and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic quality that suits the story's textural aims. Word choice is precise and sensory details are well-rendered. There are minor instances of overwriting and reliance on slightly familiar phrasing ("a sad, knowing thing"), but the overall line-level craft is strong and supports the atmosphere effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and propulsive, with high information density in most lines. Syntax and rhythm vary effectively to match the scene’s tension, from the tense, clipped movements in the dark to the more expansive realization in the chamber. There are no notable loops, scaffold, or overwriting, resulting in a polished and professional piece of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative but occasionally overwrites, particularly in its use of figurative language ("bruised sky like a bruise on glass"). There are moments of paraphrase-looping, where adjacent phrases restate the same idea with different words ("spiralingly calm, a serenity that wound through her"). These artifacts, while not pervasive, slightly dull the momentum and information density in key introductory passages.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and highly crafted, with strong rhythm and imagery. Sentences are information-dense and propel the quiet narrative forward. The score is slightly tempered by a consistent level of high figurative density; nearly every paragraph contains lush descriptions that, while beautiful, occasionally risk slowing the momentum and feeling overwrought for such a contained scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, often elegant, and propulsive. Word choice is generally strong ("sublittoral fringe," "combative tenderness"). However, there are minor instances of overwriting and reliance on familiar similes ("swayed like dancers," "eyes like moonlit pools"). The final paragraphs, while clear, fall into a slightly repetitive sentence structure that feels more declarative than lyrical, slightly diminishing the momentum of the otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, especially in the opening descriptions. The rhythm is deliberate and well-paced. A minor weakness appears in the final two paragraphs, which shift slightly from showing to summarizing ("In the emotional void... she would cultivate lightness"), a slight loss of momentum that prevents a higher score but doesn't damage the closure's integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, there is a slight tendency toward patterned phrasing that borders on a loop. The key phrase "tremor of certainty" is repeated to mark progression, which is effective but slightly heavy-handed. Similarly, the verb "paraphrase" is used both for her internal goal and her external action in close succession. These minor repetitive artifacts slightly dull the otherwise sharp and propulsive line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong, resonant imagery like "a sound like shattering glass." The rhythm and flow are excellent, carrying the narrative with a sense of wonder. There are no significant technical flaws, loops, or artifacts; the line-level craft is polished and professional, aside from a few minor generic phrases in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often evocative, particularly in its descriptions of the lab and the cave. There are, however, moments of scaffolding and abstraction, such as the direct explanation of Lira's approach or the final summary of connection as a "symphony of contradictions." These instances slightly reduce momentum and information density compared to the stronger, more concrete passages.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and polished, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a few minor flaws prevent a top-tier score, including occasional reliance on cliché ("faintest glimmer of hope") and abstract summary where concrete action would be stronger. There is also a slight tendency toward parallel sentence structures in descriptive passages that, while stylistic, borders on a repetitive cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious and rhythmically controlled, with high information density. However, it suffers from an overwriting tendency, with a relentless density of figurative language (e.g., "thousand inverted hourglasses," "silver serpent," "sorrow bled into ambition"). While often beautiful, this uniform elevation can feel performative and slightly dulls the momentum in key moments by prioritizing texture over propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("His laugh was brittle, a sound like shattering glass"). The rhythm is controlled, shifting effectively during the climax. While generally excellent, a few abstract phrases feel slightly overwrought ("purify its secrets by avoiding patterns the ancients had woven into their very bones"), momentarily trading concrete detail for conceptual weight without adding significant clarity or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with strong imagery and clear momentum. There is a minor repetitive artifact in the repeated use of "sharp eyes" (three times), which slightly dulls its impact. While generally polished, a few phrases like "luminous with regret" feel slightly overwrought, preventing the prose from achieving flawless transparency.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm is controlled, creating a momentum that supports the reflective mood. A few phrases, such as the simile "creaking like a hinge in time," lean towards being slightly overwrought or cliché, but these are minor blemishes on an otherwise polished and propulsive piece of writing. The craft is strong and never obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery, especially in the opening and the description of the memory tunnel. The line-level execution is generally very clean. A notable weakness, however, is the use of abstract, therapy-speak clichés ("honor the past without being chained to it") to articulate the peak emotional insight. This prose artifact dulls the power of the epiphany, replacing specific, visceral realization with generic summary.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates high information density. However, a few moments lean on familiar phrasing ("as if the storm were holding its breath"). The final two sentences, especially "The Alhambra’s secrets were safe with her, and she’d spend the rest of her life uncovering them," slip into summary, telling the outcome rather than letting the final image of her descending the stairs carry the full weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it frequently tips into being overwritten. A high density of figurative language ("eyes like fractured galaxies," "breath of imprisoned gods") in nearly every paragraph creates a texture so thick it occasionally slows momentum. The piece would be stronger with more concision and a more varied sentence structure to allow key images to land with greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and word choice. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding that slightly weaken its impact. The line "The woman—if she was a woman—" tells the reader how to interpret her, and the assertion "He'd never understood the weight of absence until now" functions as a thematic label that could have been demonstrated more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is consistently evocative and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and a varied sentence rhythm. The density of figurative language is very high but establishes its pattern from the opening line, making it a feature of the world's texture. There are minor instances where abstractions like "hum of insight" are used as shorthand, slightly dulling the otherwise concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and highly polished. Sentence structure is varied, and the rhythm is controlled to support the story's quiet, contemplative momentum. Figurative language, like the "bruised twilight sky," is vivid and purposeful. The story demonstrates high information density without overwriting and is free of loops, scaffolding, or other line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but occasionally tips into overwriting with phrases like "seraphically mundane thread woven into the fortress’s fabric." There is a slight tendency toward abstraction where concrete detail would be stronger. While generally clear and propulsive, the final paragraphs become less about dramatization and more about summarizing the thematic takeaway, which dulls the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it leans heavily on genre conventions and stock phrases ("stature belied her strength," "sharp as she scanned," "slow poison"). This creates a sense of polish but also predictability. Several sentences serve more to declare a state or feeling than to evoke it through specific, fresh imagery, which slightly dulls the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, with strong imagery in the first half. However, it occasionally slips into abstraction and overwriting, especially toward the end ("a rhythm that held the weight of eternity"). The final paragraphs become less propulsive as they shift from concrete action to thematic summary, slightly dulling the momentum of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often evocative, with strong imagery in the opening paragraph ("pooled like liquid gold," "bled from amber to violet"). There are no significant loops or artifacts, and momentum is well-maintained. A few phrases, like "awkward confidence blooming into something fiercer," lean toward telling, and the climax contains some slightly stock phrasing ("scent of ozone and iron"), preventing the prose from reaching an exceptional level.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely effective, with strong opening images like the springs as a "cauldron left on the stove." Momentum is well-maintained through concise sentences. The primary weakness is a tendency toward stock phrasing in a few key moments ("blooming in her thoughts like a night-blooming cereus," "painting the sky in hues of fire and ash"), which momentarily dilutes the otherwise specific and grounded prose.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Momentum is well-maintained. A recurring weakness is the occasional drift into a clinical or therapeutic register ("somatic markers," "reset a fractured soul," "deliberate, somatic choice"). This diction, while thematically relevant, sometimes clashes with the more lyrical texture of the surrounding prose, creating moments of slight abstraction where concrete embodiment would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating both precision and lyricism without a word wasted. Figurative language is consistently strong and purposeful, deepening atmosphere and theme rather than just decorating the surface (e.g., "lamplight flickering like a tired heartbeat"). The sentences are rhythmically varied and impeccably clean, free of loops, scaffolding, or other artifacts that would dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong verbs and precise imagery ("whipping the black liquid into fractal spirals"). Sentence structure is varied, maintaining a compelling rhythm that carries the reader forward. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops. A few phrases, like "consciously wild intuition," lean slightly towards labeling, but the overall execution is polished and confident, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.0)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from a reliance on clichés and stock phrases that dull its impact. Multiple key terms from the prompt ("dizzying quiet," "provoke an unspoken conversation") are repeated verbatim, creating a sense of mechanical construction rather than organic storytelling. This pattern of repetition functions as a prose artifact that keeps the language from feeling fresh or surprising.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its imagery. However, the momentum is slightly dulled in the final third by a series of declarative, summary-like sentences that explain the story's theme. For instance, the two sentences starting with "Even in..." restate the same concept, functioning as a minor paraphrase loop that tells what has already been shown, preventing the prose from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("lullaby sung by wolves"). However, it occasionally tips into overwriting, with a density of figurative language that can slightly blunt the immediacy of an action. Phrases like "emotions too complex for mortal minds" feel like a summary where a more concrete sensory detail could have been stronger. There are no critical flaws, but a final polish for concision would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. The language is precise, with strong imagery ("gears grinding like a celestial heartbeat," "dossier thick enough to choke a lie"). There is a slight tendency towards polished aphorisms that can feel a little too neat, but the overall rhythm and clarity are excellent, with no notable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is a significant strength, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The prose is elegant and dense with imagery ("her needle a silver quill against the canvas of flesh," "digital ghosts that whispered in binary"). The language is precise and evocative throughout, with a strong rhythm and no noticeable artifacts or overwriting, creating a seamless and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and largely excellent, with a strong opening and a consistent rhythm. Word choice is precise and sensory details are rendered effectively ("clung to the grotto’s entrance like a second skin"). There is a minor slip into a slightly clichéd phrase ("motivation crystallized") which momentarily lessens the otherwise high quality of the line-level craft. However, the overall momentum and clarity are unimpeded, and the prose remains a significant strength.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.5)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from a density of overwriting and figurative language that sometimes slips into cliché ("candle in a storm," "smile like the first light of dawn"). The repetition of the paradoxical phrase "warm coldness" stands out as a noticeable prose artifact. This tendency to lean on poetic but familiar descriptors slightly dulls the immediacy of key moments, prioritizing literary texture over sharp clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from a uniform density of figurative language that can feel overwrought. Even in moments of high action, the descriptive register remains ornate, which holds the reader at an aesthetic distance rather than pulling them into the urgency of the climax. A more selective application of its lyrical style would heighten its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its opening. The rhythm and syntax are well-controlled to match the story's pace. A notable flaw is the repeated use of the unique phrase "willowglass hope," which reads as a writerly artifact rather than an intentional motif, slightly marring an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.5)
    While generally clean, the prose is weakened by scaffolding and summary in the final two paragraphs. Sentences that explain the meaning of the climax ("She understood now...") and her new role ("She was no longer just a map maker...") are redundant and slow the momentum of an otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic, effectively building atmosphere, particularly in the opening. However, there are minor instances of overwriting and reliance on stock similes ("groaning like ancient bones," "sharpened like flint") that feel more decorative than precise. While generally strong, the line-level craft could achieve greater concision and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.5)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with evocative and precise language. The opening is particularly effective. The primary weakness is a tendency toward over-writing in the final paragraphs, where abstract thematic statements replace the concrete imagery that drove the earlier sections. This scaffolding flattens the momentum just before the close, reading more like an authorial explanation than a character's thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often elegant and imagistic, but it is significantly hampered by conceptual redundancy. The repetition of key thematic phrases like "distill complexity into essence" creates a loop that stalls momentum and reads as scaffolding. This over-insistence on the core idea flattens the prose's texture and demonstrates a lack of trust in the reader. While individual sentences are strong, these structural artifacts measurably dull the story's impact, especially for a piece that relies so heavily on textural nuance.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, a few phrases lean into abstraction where concrete imagery would be stronger (e.g., "a storm of dark energy"). The final two paragraphs contain sentences that summarize the theme, functioning as scaffolding that could be removed to let the final actions resonate more powerfully on their own.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with varied sentence structures that support the story's contemplative momentum. Imagery is vivid and purposeful, with high information density in most lines. There are no notable text artifacts or loops. The piece is very polished at the line level, with only a few phrases bordering on sentimentality, which slightly tempers the overall effect.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense with vivid imagery, and maintains a controlled, resonant rhythm that supports the story's accumulative structure. Sentences like "the shelves swayed with the moon’s breath" establish the tone immediately and effectively. The craft is nearly flawless, with high information density and strong propulsion, avoiding any significant overwriting or scaffolding, even amid its lush descriptions.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and clear imagery that drive momentum. Sentences are well-structured, and there are no significant grammatical or proofreading errors. The writing occasionally dips into overwrought phrasing ("robe woven from water lilies, her hair a cascade of vines") that feels more fairytale than emotionally grounded, but these instances are infrequent and do not obscure clarity or harm the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clear, concise, and carries strong momentum. Imagery like "wind chimes made of starlight" and a script that "shifted like smoke" is vivid and effective. While a few phrases lean toward cliché ("older than time," "cosmos was a chessboard"), the overall execution is clean, with high information density and no significant prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clear, propulsive, and generally well-crafted, with strong imagery like the "fractured blues and golds" on the floor. There is a slight tendency towards overwriting with grand but abstract descriptors ("unravel the very fabric of the room"). The primary weakness is the authorial intrusion in the final lines, which summarize emotion and theme rather than letting the final image do the work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The descriptive prose is often strong and concise, with good rhythm. However, the piece is marred by several instances of telling over showing, particularly when summarizing its own themes ("Opposites unified..."). Some figurative language, like the ribbon "glowing like a vein of blood," feels slightly overwrought and pulls away from the otherwise grounded tone.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, concise, and maintains momentum. Sentences are well-structured and information is delivered efficiently. The piece avoids major overwriting, but it does lean on some familiar atmospheric descriptors ("sickly green" sky, "howled through the vents," "anxious sentinels") that, while effective, border on cliché. The craftsmanship is solid and professional, but lacks the line-level surprise of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. Momentum is well-maintained. A significant flaw is the phrase "dynamically observant," an awkward piece of telling that disrupts the otherwise immersive prose. While the conceptual jargon is central to the plot, its abstract nature creates some friction against the more grounded, sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from moments of redundancy ("a polished calm, a perceptively calm demeanor") and scaffolding that states the obvious. The final two paragraphs abandon scene work entirely for a summary of actions and thematic conclusions ("He’d discovered... He’d used... He’d dissuaded..."). This shift into exposition drains the ending of its potential momentum and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong, evocative imagery from the opening line. While the high density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwrought (e.g., "a tide finding its shore"), it largely serves the story's speculative and lyrical tone. The line-level craft is clean, with good momentum and no significant syntactic loops or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often vivid and evocative, with strong opening imagery that establishes atmosphere effectively. Sentences are generally clear and propulsive. The primary weakness is a tendency toward cliché in key emotional descriptors ("heart locked behind walls of thorns and silence") and the previously noted issue of the final paragraph's prose becoming too explanatory, sacrificing resonance for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and often vivid, with strong verbs and compelling images. The story maintains momentum and information density without significant scaffolding. Minor deductions are for a few instances of familiar fantasy phrasing, such as "Visions erupted behind her eyelids" and the "burst of light" at the climax, which momentarily dip into slightly generic description rather than maintaining the story's otherwise high level of specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and imagistic, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. Line-level craft is generally very high, creating a rich atmosphere. The score is slightly tempered by the repetitive use of the key phrase "fiercely gentle," which feels heavy-handed, and a few familiar similes like "black as midnight."

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally sharp and evocative, with strong verbs and concrete sensory details. However, the final two paragraphs slip from showing into telling. Phrases like "he realized he’d found his purpose" and the concluding thematic statement summarize the emotional shift rather than embodying it, which dulls the impact of the otherwise well-crafted final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms that propel the narrative. Information density is high, with most sentences serving character, atmosphere, and plot. There is a minor instance of scaffolding in the line "Elara’s motivation had always been to understand, but now she understood something deeper," which paraphrases an internal shift rather than letting it be fully embodied in the subsequent action.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich with imagery and maintains a consistent, dreamlike rhythm. However, it borders on overwriting; the high density of figurative language ("voice like a conch shell's echo," "sound like wind through reeds") in nearly every description can feel slightly excessive, occasionally slowing momentum. While beautiful, a more selective application of metaphor would have heightened the impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often evocative and rhythmically strong, with high information density in the opening paragraphs. However, the final three paragraphs lose momentum, shifting from dramatization to summary. This epilogue-like section feels tacked on and less potent than the preceding scene work. Phrases like "heartbeat of a hesitation" are effective but lean towards the familiar, and the direct explanation of the theme in the final lines replaces resonant imagery with prose that feels like scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong sensory details that bring the station to life. Sentences are well-crafted and propel the narrative forward. The only minor weakness is a tendency to summarize the emotional payoff in the final act, as in, "...the station had given her something better: a language to articulate her pain," which tells the reader a conclusion the preceding scene had already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and often evocative, but it occasionally relies on stock phrases ("weight of time itself pressing against her chest," "racing heart") that dull its impact. There is a slight tendency toward summary and abstraction over concrete, sensory detail in key emotional moments. While free of major errors, the line-level craft lacks the consistent sharpness and information density required for the highest tier of literary fiction, showing moments of scaffolding like "The library was no ordinary place."

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with nearly every line serving multiple functions. Figurative language is rich but purposeful, as in the violin's provenance being "a composer’s last breath, a storm’s fury, a child’s laugh frozen mid-giggle." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the syntax varies to create a compelling rhythm that carries the narrative forward. This is precise, high-impact writing.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and highly efficient, with high information density in its descriptions and actions. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors the story's tension, from the "radiant hush" to the frantic race against the cracking pool. The figurative language is vivid and purposeful, avoiding ornamental excess and contributing directly to world-building and characterization without a single mixed metaphor or cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong imagery like "clouds pooled like liquid silver." However, it occasionally relies on abstractions and overwrought metaphors, especially near the end ("scalloping their edges until they fit together again"). The triple repetition of the phrase "vineyard hush," while tonal, borders on becoming a noticeable prose artifact in a piece this short.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, there are occasional lapses into overwriting where the symbolism becomes too literal, such as describing the cloak as "a tattered garment woven from years of second-guessing and half-truths." While effective, this phrasing verges on cliché and lacks the subtlety demonstrated elsewhere, slightly dulling the line-level sharpness required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic control that supports the hushed, mystical atmosphere. While the density of figurative language is high (e.g., "spider spinning a web from the breath of the wind"), it generally serves the tone without obscuring clarity. There are no significant loops or scaffold phrases; each sentence works to build the story's unique texture.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong opening imagery. However, there are minor momentum drags from near-redundant phrasing, such as the repeated use of "weathered resolve" and the paraphrasing of the core motivation in different paragraphs. The explanatory sentences near the end, while thematically clear, read more like summary than propelled scene-work, slightly reducing the information density of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, with strong opening imagery. However, the momentum is dulled by scaffold phrases, particularly near the end ("He realized then...", "Kael knew the truth now..."). These constructions summarize internal shifts that the preceding actions had already successfully implied, creating redundancy that slightly flattens the climax and conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel slightly strained ("latched onto his ribs like a second heartbeat"). While there are no major technical flaws like loops or scaffolds, a more restrained hand in key moments would have allowed the most powerful images to land with even greater force. The overall momentum and clarity remain high despite this density.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is frequently beautiful and evocative, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. However, it occasionally relies on familiar sci-fi imagery or stock phrases ("burned like a supernova," "clung to him like stardust") that slightly diminish the specificity of key moments. The density of abstract concepts like "intention," "coherence," and "purpose" occasionally makes the prose feel less grounded than the excellent physical descriptions of the deck and coins.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely free of artifacts. Sentences are well-constructed with a strong rhythm, particularly in the descriptive passages ("its stone walls streaked with the amber light of dusk"). There are minor instances where concision could be improved (e.g., “its parchment brittle yet stubbornly intact”), but these are infrequent and do not disrupt the story's momentum or clarity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong opening and closing images. The rhythm is well-paced, building tension during the delicate calibration of the bell. There are minor instances of stock phrasing ("candle in a draft," "vibrated in his bones") and a slight authorial tic of using parallel sentence structures in adjacent paragraphs, which keeps the piece just shy of top marks.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that detract from its polish. The phrase "precisely humane" feels like an inorganic insertion, and the final sentence resorts to summarizing the theme rather than letting the preceding image do the work, slightly dulling the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, but it is consistently hampered by overwriting. Nearly every sentence in descriptive passages is laden with figurative language ("liquid stained glass," "trapped starlight," "living mosaic"), creating a density that can feel strenuous and slightly purple. While many images are individually beautiful, their sheer volume dulls their collective impact; a more selective application would have allowed the strongest moments to resonate more powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and carries a strong forward momentum. Word choice is precise and evocative ("fractal light," "liquid silver"). The primary weakness is a minor tendency toward thematic labeling, particularly in phrases like "The watcher’s burden weighed heavy" and the final paragraph's articulation of the theme, which borders on telling what was already effectively shown.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clear and propulsive, but relies on several stock metaphors and similes in key moments ("dissolved like sugar in tea," "burned like a wildfire," "knife through butter," "dormant volcano"). These familiar phrases slightly dull the immediacy of high-pressure beats, preventing the line-level craft from matching the strength of the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The primary weakness is the tendency to summarize the thematic takeaway in the final paragraphs, which lessens the impact of the discovery. Phrases like "He began to flow through orthogonal approaches" are slightly clunky, and the repetition of "storm-born silence" is noticeable, minor blemishes on an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm and imagery. The word choice is precise and often surprising (e.g., "macerate"). However, a few minor instances of telling, such as "Marlowe’s motivation was simple," slightly blunt the otherwise sharp execution of showing. While the line-level craft is very high, these small moments of scaffolding prevent a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and highly efficient, demonstrating high information density in nearly every line. The rhythm of the sentences modulates effectively with the scene's tension, from the stillness of the opening to the decisive action of the climax. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the language is a clear and powerful vehicle for the story.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong verbs and precise imagery ("pulsed like a wounded heart," "twisted into a grotesque question mark"). Sentence structure is varied, providing a compelling rhythm that carries the story's momentum. There are no significant loops or scaffolding; every line serves a clear purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong verbs and striking imagery. There is, however, a tendency toward a high density of figurative language that occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly slowing the momentum in a few places. The repetition of "serenely electric" feels less like a deliberate motif and more like a slight tic. Despite this, the line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong and free of mechanical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with high information density in most lines. The writing is largely excellent, but a few phrases rely on familiar constructions ("followed like a shadow," "light of a thousand suns") that momentarily soften the otherwise unique texture. These minor instances prevent a higher score but do not significantly impede the story's momentum or clarity, even at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought rather than propulsive, especially in the opening. The final two paragraphs shift from showing to telling, summarizing the thematic takeaway and slowing the momentum just before the close. This summarizing tendency slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise strong and atmospheric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative for the most part, demonstrating strong command of rhythm and imagery. There are, however, minor instances of telling where showing would be stronger, such as the direct summary of the students' curiosity. A slight paraphrase loop occurs in the fourth paragraph ("She wanted to learn... She wanted to feel..."), which momentarily slows the momentum, preventing an otherwise excellent piece from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and generally clear, with strong opening imagery. The primary weakness is a tendency toward redundancy in the final paragraphs. The lines “She’d assured a vulnerable voice... all because she’d listened” and “She’d done what she came to do: protected a voice...” create a paraphrase loop that summarizes what was just shown, slightly dulling the momentum of an otherwise strong ending.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, with high information density in every line. There are no wasted words, loops, or clunky scaffolding. Phrases like "a star trapped in amber" and "crashing hush of the sea" demonstrate a strong command of language and rhythm that propels the narrative forward beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality—precise, evocative, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language ("hummed with the ghost of starlight," "gears grinding like old bones") is not ornamental but foundational to the story's atmosphere and meaning. Sentences carry a high density of information without feeling overwritten, and there are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding to dull the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, characterized by high information density, striking imagery, and syntactic variety that drives momentum. Figurative language ("shadows streaked across the bone towers like ink spilled on parchment") is evocative without becoming overwrought. There are no discernible prose artifacts; every line serves the story's atmosphere and progression.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum, particularly during the disorienting transformation sequence. A few phrases, like "her pocket vibrated" for a stone arrowhead, create a momentary friction, but it's immediately justified by the object's mystical nature. The final line, "frostbitten hope curdling into resolve," is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is rich and imagistic, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. However, the density of figurative language, particularly the heavy reliance on similes ("like captured sunsets," "like moth wings," "like a secret," "like wind chimes," "like a fallen star"), verges on overwriting in key moments. This occasionally dilutes the impact of individual images by stacking them too closely.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lyrical and confident, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the opening paragraph is freighted with a high density of figurative language (“bruise,” “veins,” “wound stitched with light”) that borders on overwriting. This front-loading slightly impedes momentum before the story finds its rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that prevent a higher score. A paraphrase loop occurs between the first paragraph's statement of intent ("to interpret silence as possibility") and a later one ("Elio’s motivation had always been..."). Phrases like "The sound wasn’t just noise—it was a map, a guide" employ a scaffolding structure that slightly tells over shows.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and clear, with strong sensory details that build a vivid atmosphere. The line-level craft is professional, with varied sentence structures and purposeful pacing. While effective, the piece relies on a few familiar phrases ("adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses," "heartbeat quickened") that prevent the otherwise excellent prose from feeling wholly original.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious but suffers from a lack of modulation. The density of figurative language is consistently high from the first sentence to the last, resulting in an overwrought texture that can numb the reader's senses. While many phrases are beautiful in isolation ("sky wore a bruise of twilight"), their relentless application dulls the impact of crucial moments.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative but is held back by a reliance on some common idioms ("tilted on its axis," "give it wings") and a final paragraph that summarizes the climax's meaning. These moments of telling rather than showing dull the impact of an otherwise atmospheric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Momentum is well-maintained. The primary weakness lies in the final paragraph, which contains several instances of telling over showing and paraphrasing the theme ("He’d recover the memories, not for himself, but for the folklorist he’d always been..."). This moment of scaffolding slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise sharp and well-crafted narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong imagery ("a sliver of light slicing through a crack"). The rhythm is well-controlled. A few phrases like "mentored resilience quietly" lean towards abstract summary rather than concrete action, and the final sentence feels slightly less sharp than the prose that precedes it, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often evocative. However, there is a tendency towards overwriting with figurative language that, while pretty, can feel generic ("pink tongues," "tapestry of whispers"). These moments slightly reduce the information density and prevent the line-level craft from reaching an exceptional tier, as they soften the impact of more concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its descriptions ("caked in salt and memory," "threads falling away like old skin"). The syntax varies to match the story's momentum, and word choice is consistently strong. There are no significant loops or scaffolding. A minor weakness is a moment of near-cliché ("a chorus of ghosts pleading to be heard"), but this is a small slip in an otherwise polished piece. The final paragraphs are particularly sharp, using short, declarative sentences to convey Mara's lucid state: "Not at peace, exactly. But awake. Alive."

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, concise, and carries a strong rhythm. The descriptive language is generally effective, particularly in establishing atmosphere. A minor but recurring weakness is the use of italics for emphasis on key conceptual words (*threshold*, *puzzle*, *language*), which functions as a slightly heavy-handed authorial signpost, telling the reader what to deem important rather than letting the ideas land organically.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. Sentences are well-constructed and rhythmically controlled, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The only minor friction is a slight tendency toward abstract emotional descriptors ("decades of unspoken grief," "quiet, analytic ache") where more concrete, embodied language could have landed with even greater force, preventing the prose from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, elegant, and often beautiful, with a varied sentence rhythm that supports the story's momentum. However, the line-level craft is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting; the density of figurative language is consistently high, occasionally blunting the impact of key moments with excessive adornment. While there are no egregious artifacts, this pervasive ornate quality prevents the prose from achieving the clean, piercing clarity it might have.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a confident rhythm ("gears grinding like a tired heart," "grief like a second skin"). The sentences are varied and propel the narrative forward with clarity and purpose. There are a few instances of familiar phrasing ("bared a soul that frayed at the edges") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution, but there are no significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and precise for most of the story, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the mood beautifully. A minor deduction is warranted for the final paragraph, which slightly slips into summary ("its journey a testament to the dusty starlight of belief"). This moment of telling, however brief, slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise pristine piece, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm, and word choice is precise and evocative. While a small amount of initial setup is handled via efficient telling, it serves to ground the character's unique abilities quickly and doesn't detract from the story's momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clear, concise, and maintains momentum, with several strong images ("swirling in liquid darkness"). However, a few stock phrases ("pulsing like a heartbeat") and the use of summary in the crucial beat of discovery ("Images flooded her mind") slightly dull the impact. The line-level craft is highly competent but lacks the consistent, striking precision needed for a top-tier rating.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery. However, the final paragraph functions as thematic scaffolding, restating conclusions that the preceding action had already earned. This redundancy dulls the impact of the powerful final image (the clock ticking) and constitutes a significant prose artifact at the story's most critical moment.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and generally well-crafted, but it relies on an abundance of high-fantasy descriptors that occasionally feel overwrought ("ancient sentinels," "ethereal script"). Phrases like "the orchard planet’s brambled hope was palpable" are strained. The opening paragraphs are heavy with exposition, slowing momentum. While there are no grammatical errors or significant artifacts, the density of figurative language sometimes muffles the story's emotional core rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. There are minor instances of overwriting and lofty phrasing in the opening ("recalibrating the world’s most fragile mechanisms"). However, the language during the critical final beats is propulsive and clear, avoiding figurative clutter and landing the emotional climax with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details that carry the narrative forward. Sentences are varied and rhythmically sound, accelerating in moments of high tension. The craft is clean, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, allowing the story's atmosphere and momentum to build without obstruction.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean but lacks propulsion and specificity in key moments, relying on abstractions like "loosened grief." A significant craft issue is the repetition of the scaffolding phrase "As the pieces fell into place," which appears twice, suggesting a narrative template. While generally free of errors, the line-level execution does not rise to the level of precision required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong, specific imagery ("gravel stirred in water"). The rhythm is controlled and supports the story's atmospheric quality. Minor deductions are for the slight overuse of the key phrase "glimmering parole" and a final line ("She was ready to begin again") that feels more generic than the evocative language preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery ("spires glinting like frozen seafoam," "shifted like living ink"). While powerful, there are a few moments where the language borders on being overly declarative about its own metaphors, such as "to sandpaper rough memories, to blunt their edges." The parallel structure in the final paragraph ("He chopped onions... He simmered broth...") is effective but a noticeable and slightly formal device. These are minor points in otherwise polished and propulsive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it leans into overwriting, particularly with its density of figurative language ("hush of borrowed starlight," "shadows that danced like restless spirits"). Some phrasing, like "empathetically decisive" or "vigorous tenderness," feels like conceptual labeling rather than sharp, concrete description. This decorative tendency occasionally slows momentum and makes the prose feel self-consciously "literary" rather than organically propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often evocative and precise, with strong imagery. However, momentum is slightly dampened during the climax by an expository sentence explaining synaptic plasticity ("By overwhelming the mirror’s surface..."). This brief turn to "telling" interrupts the tension. Additionally, a few phrases like "liquid mercury" or "shattered constellations" lean towards well-worn sci-fi descriptions, slightly dulling the overall sharpness.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced. However, there's a tendency toward high-density, sometimes overwrought figurative language ("defy the land’s own bones," "teeth biting into her palm like a promise") that can feel more decorative than functional. The final paragraph shifts slightly into telling the character's change ("she’d return as a keeper") rather than embodying it purely through image.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("shards scattering like starlight"). The rhythm and sentence structure are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative forward. The piece is held back from the highest tier by a few instances of familiar phrasing ("burned fierce," "tears carving paths") and a final paragraph that summarizes the story's impact rather than letting the final image do the work, which slightly dulls the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is polished and professional, marked by high information density and strong, evocative imagery like "twilight bled violet." The prose is largely free of artifacts, loops, or scaffolding, propelling the narrative with a steady, deliberate momentum. While a few phrases lean toward fantasy convention ("robes of woven light"), the overall execution is sharp, clear, and elegant.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often evocative, especially in its description of the workshop. However, the momentum is slightly dulled by several instances of telling over showing, particularly in the final three paragraphs which summarize Lirael’s emotional journey and thematic realization. This expository block, while clearly written, reads like scaffolding that should have been removed to let the story's climax stand on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, but it's held back by several prose artifacts. Redundancies like "olfactorily sensitive nose" and repeated scaffold phrases like "the undercurrent of wisdom" dull the momentum. The final metaphor, "doodled on the wrapping paper of her heart," is overwrought and clashes with the otherwise grounded tone of Lira's practice.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and propulsive, with high information density and strong sensory details. Figurative language is well-integrated and enhances the atmosphere. The primary weakness is in the final paragraph, where the shift to direct thematic exposition feels less crafted than the rest of the narrative. This, combined with the logical inconsistency of the arrow tip's location, marks a slight decline in craft at the crucial closing moment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and possesses a strong rhythmic quality, with varied sentence structures that propel the narrative forward. Images like "silence had settled like a second skin" and "debris scattered like dropped breadcrumbs" are vivid and efficient. There are minor instances of clichéd phrasing ("raced to connect the dots") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution, but the piece is free from significant loops, scaffolding, or overwriting, particularly in its critical final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates a high level of craft, with memorable, evocative phrases ("sculpted hush made flesh," "silence pooled like indigo ink"). The rhythm is controlled and supports the story's atmospheric goals. The main area for improvement is a tendency towards high figurative density that occasionally borders on overwriting, though it never fully obscures clarity. The line-level execution is very strong with no technical errors or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often evocative, but occasionally leans on familiar figurative language ("needle through silk," "held its breath"). A few phrases, like the repeated "avalanchingly quiet," feel slightly overwrought, creating a density that borders on purple prose in moments. While grammatically clean and rhythmically sound, the piece lacks the final degree of concision and freshness required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with fresh, inventive figurative language, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The rhythm is controlled and the word choice is excellent. Minor slips into more generic phrasing during the climax, such as "kaleidoscope of memories," slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution and prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and efficient, with strong verbs and evocative imagery, particularly in the first half. The rhythm and syntax support the tense, mystical atmosphere without drawing undue attention. A minor flaw appears in the final two paragraphs, where the prose shifts from sensory action to declarative summary, slightly slowing the momentum just before the end, but the overall craft remains very high.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong opening and closing lines. Sentences are well-constructed, creating a deliberate, almost incantatory rhythm that suits the story's mood. While a few phrases lean toward the familiar (e.g., "absorbed them like a sponge"), the overall quality is high, with excellent information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic quality. Information density is high, with most sentences serving multiple functions. The primary weakness is a tendency toward overwriting in the final paragraph, which summarizes the theme and reuses prompt-like language ("stoically sparkling"), feeling less organic than the rest of the piece. This slightly dulls the otherwise sharp closure.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally strong, with clear, evocative language and a good rhythmic sense. Figurative language is mostly effective ("voice like gravel," "tunnels branched like veins"). The primary weakness is the repetition of the phrase "bartered awakening," which feels slightly mechanical, like an echo of a prompt. This, combined with the clunky thematic line at the climax, prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier, but there are no significant structural flaws like loops or scaffolds.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control that aligns with the story's momentum. The language is precise and evocative. The score is held back by one notable blemish: the use of the cliché "a knife that cut both ways" during a pivotal moment of realization, which momentarily flattens the otherwise specific and textured prose.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density with strong, evocative verbs. The rhythm and syntax support the story’s quiet, contemplative mood. There are no technical errors. The score is slightly tempered by the same issue noted in Theme: the final paragraphs contain sentences that summarize and explain the meaning ("a reminder that even when the lamp flickers out, the sea’s children find ways to endure"), which reads as a minor scaffolding artifact in an otherwise seamless piece.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and a varied sentence structure that propels the narrative. However, the density of figurative language, particularly the frequent use of similes ("like a captured comet," "like wind chimes in a hurricane," "like restless gods"), occasionally borders on overwriting. While often beautiful, a more selective deployment in high-pressure moments could have amplified their impact further.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is luminous and precise for most of the story, with strong verbs and evocative, concrete imagery. The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-crafted. The score is held back by the final paragraphs, which shift from the potent "showing" of the story's beginning to "telling," summarizing Lin's future and her realization in more abstract terms, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp craft.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details that build a vivid world. Sentences are well-structured, carrying information and atmosphere with impressive density. There is a slight tendency towards abstract, elevated phrasing ("quantified sorrow," "scattered dreams") that, while consistent, occasionally risks feeling more declared than earned. The line-level craft is otherwise very clean, with no significant artifacts or momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with strong, clear imagery throughout. Sentences are crafted with a poet's ear for rhythm and density. A minor weakness is a tendency toward slight overwriting in a few places, where the figurative language becomes stacked, such as the phrase "a bound release of hope." There is also a small paraphrase loop in the third paragraph ("songs were silent...stories scattered...Lira’s role was to gather those ashes") that could be tightened, but these are minor issues in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and clean, with strong imagery in the first half. However, it falters slightly in key moments by relying on familiar phrasing like “Tears prickled her eyes” and by explicitly summarizing the protagonist's realization in the final paragraphs, which weakens the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and concise, with high information density and a strong, controlled rhythm. Word choice is consistently excellent. The piece is nearly flawless at the line level, but the repeated use of the slightly awkward phrase "heuristically gentle" feels like a dutiful inclusion rather than a natural part of the prose, creating a minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with strong imagery. However, a few minor blemishes, such as the slightly clichéd phrase "frustration gnawed at her" and the summary-like final sentence ("She had done it."), prevent it from reaching the highest tier. The craft is very strong but lacks the final polish of flawless execution in every line.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, concise, and highly evocative. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the tense narrative. Word choice is precise and information density is high, with lines like “stubbornness with a thesaurus” doing significant character work with great economy. No loops or scaffold phrases clutter the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently strong, with high information density and striking, specific imagery. The opening sentence is verging on overwritten, but it effectively sets the fantastical tone. The syntax varies with the scene’s pressure, and the sensory details are sharp and purposeful. There are no significant loops or scaffolding; the piece is polished and propelled by its line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with memorable phrases like "auroral sorrow" and "a mouth mid-scream." While generally concise and purposeful, a few phrases like "festered inside him like a wound" or "soul starved of color" lean on familiar constructions. These are minor slips in an otherwise polished and propulsive piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and highly atmospheric, with strong verbs and specific, sensory language ("ink that shimmered like poisoned honey"). Sentence structure is varied, providing a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the narrative. While the opening paragraph is dense with figurative language, it successfully establishes the world's texture without impeding momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there is a recurring reliance on high-level abstractions like “symphonies of truth” and “color of wonder,” which, while thematically central, can feel slightly ungrounded. The final paragraphs, in their shift to summary, lose the momentum of the preceding scene-work, explaining the meaning rather than letting the final action carry the full weight of the story’s resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, concise, and rhythmically controlled from the first sentence to the last. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative, creating high information density without a single wasted phrase. There are no prose artifacts; every line serves to advance the story's atmosphere, character, and momentum with exceptional clarity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally effective, with some nice descriptive passages. However, it occasionally relies on stock phrases ("pulse quickened," "curiosity burned") and tells the reader the meaning of an event in the final paragraph. The line-level craft is competent and avoids major artifacts but lacks the density and propulsion of truly top-tier prose.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is elegant and propulsive, with a high density of evocative, well-chosen figurative language. The prose is clean and free of cliché or scaffolding. A minor flaw emerges at the climax, where lyrical description is asked to do the work of causality—"shadows that tangled the drones’ sensors" is a beautiful image but an unconvincing mechanism, using prose to obscure a plot convenience rather than clarify an action.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clear and functional, with a generally smooth rhythm. However, there are moments where momentum is slowed by telling instead of showing, particularly in the final paragraph's summary of Elias's new purpose. Some phrasing feels slightly generic, and there's a lack of the high information density and syntactic variety seen in top-tier prose, which keeps the piece from feeling truly propelled at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative and polished, but it suffers from a few key artifacts. Several unique phrases ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") are repeated, feeling more like mandated inclusions than organically recurring motifs. This repetition, along with some dense, abstract phrasing ("muted by the weight of unspoken truths"), creates slight overwriting that momentarily stalls the otherwise strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in every sentence. Phrases like "the dialects of stone and timber" and "a puzzle with no edges" establish character and tone with remarkable efficiency. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative forward without a single wasted word or clunky construction. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting; the craft is clean and professional.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details that build a potent atmosphere. The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for reflection and quickening during the climactic ritual. While the language occasionally verges on being overly rich, it remains coherent and purposeful, consistently serving the story's magical-realist tone without impeding momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and evocative figurative language ("silence pressed in, thick as velvet"). The prose has a deliberate, measured rhythm that supports the story's meditative pace. A minor deduction is for a subtle paraphrase loop where two consecutive sentences articulate her core purpose in slightly different ways, a small redundancy in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently lyrical and evocative, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. However, there are moments of slight overwriting where figurative language becomes overly dense ("webs of intrigue," "fabric of the nexus"). This occasional tendency toward abstraction and decorative phrasing slightly dulls the momentum in an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. The craft is generally high, though a few phrases border on cliché ("rustle of wind through frozen reeds"). The main weakness is the tendency to summarize theme in declarative sentences, but the line-level execution of the dream sequences is clear and evocative, carrying the story's emotional weight effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong, varied rhythm. However, a minor paraphrase loop occurs when Kael's philosophy is stated twice in quick succession ("each knot a testament to patience. To appreciate hidden effort, he believed..."). While the dense, figurative language is generally effective, it occasionally borders on overwriting, slightly impeding momentum in a few places.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, efficient, and often evocative, with strong opening and closing images. Sentence structure is varied, maintaining momentum throughout. There are minor instances of summary where showing would be stronger, particularly in the reveal of the two diamonds' purpose ("The flawed diamond had been a decoy...The true stillpoint required sacrifice"). Overall, however, the line-level craft is sharp and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often striking, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language is relentless ("clawed," "jagged fingers," "drowned skies," "gone feral," "wounded beast") and occasionally feels overwrought, especially in the opening paragraphs. While it establishes a powerful atmosphere, a few moments of plainer language would provide rhythmic contrast and heighten the impact of the most crucial images, preventing the style from verging on self-conscious.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmic, with strong sensory details and well-crafted sentences. The primary weakness is the scaffolding in the final paragraphs, which summarizes the emotional and thematic takeaways rather than allowing them to resonate through image and action. This slightly dulls the momentum and impact of the otherwise powerful final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum. However, there are minor instances of overwriting (e.g., "bled tangerine and lavender") and a tendency to summarize in the final two paragraphs. The phrasing around "sonic absolution" ("the term clicking into place") feels slightly artificial, like a convenience for naming the concept rather than a natural thought.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong imagery ("etched the basalt sanctuary in silver," "a dialogue of stillness and motion"). However, there are minor instances of near-redundancy, such as the repeated framing of "sculpting patience from impatience." The final paragraphs, while effective, lean slightly into summary rather than maintaining the high level of scene-based immediacy established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive for most of the story, with strong sensory details. The final two paragraphs, however, slip into a slightly more summary-like mode, stating Mara’s intentions (“She’d use the lantern... She’d expose his secrets...”) rather than fully embodying her crystallized resolve in image and action. This slightly reduces the momentum and immediacy of the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in the opening description. However, the piece is held back by minor but noticeable flaws. It resorts to several clichés ("eyes crinkling at the corners," "soft as the chime of a music box"). The phrasing "In the calm before realization" is slightly awkward and abstract. These small imperfections, while not pervasive, detract from an otherwise polished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is muscular and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with no discernible loops or scaffolding. Information density is high, and the language is ambitious. The score is moderated slightly because the very high density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwritten, a stylistic choice that risks pulling focus from the action. However, clarity is never sacrificed, and the propulsion remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clear and propulsive. However, it relies on several common genre phrases ("sea of data streams," "fingers danced," "heart raced") that reduce its specificity. The repetition of "brightly attentive" is a minor but noticeable artifact. These elements slightly dull the line-level execution, preventing the prose from achieving a higher level of precision and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous and precise, with strong imagery like "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "midnight ice." However, there are moments where the rhythm becomes slightly mechanical, particularly in the list-like transformation of emotions: "The sailor’s terror became... The mother’s clutch became... The lover’s smile became..." This template cadence, while clear, lessens the organic feel of the climax. The final paragraph also drifts toward abstraction, slightly dulling the sharpness of the preceding scenes.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms. There is a high information density in the descriptive passages. However, the piece is slightly weakened by a recurring prose artifact: the conceptual phrase "The fold in patience." Its abstract, almost academic quality feels out of place within Lila's immediate sensory experience, reading more like an authorial gloss than an organic thought, which momentarily stalls the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, but it is marred by moments of overwriting and register drift. The phrase “nurturing intersubjective understanding” is a jarring piece of academic language that breaks the established lyrical tone. Similarly, the final sentence summarizes the story's theme rather than letting the final image resonate on its own, feeling like an unnecessary piece of scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, the final four paragraphs contain several near-redundant statements confirming the resolution ("The echo is preserved," "wisdom safe for another cycle," "balance was restored," "The echo of wisdom was safe"). This slight looping dulls the sharp impact of the initial closure.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the setting. However, there are moments where abstract summary replaces concrete imagery, such as "abandonment into possibility." This, along with some slight repetitiveness in phrasing ("arcs," "climbed"), creates minor drags in momentum. The piece avoids major overwriting, but could be sharpened by grounding every conceptual statement in more specific, sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, but a few issues prevent a higher score. There is a slight paraphrase loop in the closing paragraphs where his newfound resolve is stated and then restated, dulling the impact of the final beat. Some figurative language, while well-written, borders on the familiar ("weighed on him like the silence of unread pages").

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, with a good sense of rhythm. However, there are minor but noticeable instances of overwriting and cliché that hold it back from the highest tier. Phrases like "tidal longing that pulsed in his veins" and a list-like sentence structure in the penultimate paragraph ("But he also remembered the chalk... the driftwood...") are small artifacts that slightly dull the momentum before the otherwise sharp ending.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few phrases lean toward familiar constructions ("cracks spiderwebbed," "churned like boiling milk") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft. The sentence "The term, borrowed from astronomy, meant..." is a moment of telling that briefly interrupts the story's momentum, a minor but noticeable scaffold in an otherwise propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Momentum is well-maintained. A recurring prose artifact—the use of abstract, conceptual labels like "reunification" and "alchemy of melody" in place of concrete description—slightly dulls the immediacy of key beats and constitutes a minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clear, concise, and largely free of errors, with a rhythm that supports the story's deliberate pace. Some phrasing, such as "Her motivation was simple yet profound," leans towards telling rather than showing and borders on scaffolding. While the line-level craft is strong, it could achieve higher information density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong imagery and a confident rhythm. The opening paragraph sets the scene and character with impressive economy. The primary weakness lies in a few moments of abstract statement where concrete action would be stronger, particularly the explicit summary of forgiveness. This creates a slight momentum drag in the resolution by telling the reader what to feel, rather than letting the image of the flowing fountain do the work on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is luminous and exceptionally clean, with high information density in every line. There are no wasted words, loops, or syntactic artifacts. The rhythm of the sentences mirrors Elara's focused, meditative state, accelerating slightly as her understanding dawns and settling into a quiet cadence at the end. The craft is virtually flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for introspection and quickening slightly in dialogue. There are no significant loops or artifacts. A few phrases lean toward the poetic at the expense of pure character voice ("You’ve mapped the building’s heartbeat"), but the overall craft is strong and supports the story's momentum and atmosphere without distraction.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.3)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and has a high information density, with figurative language that is both original and thematically coherent ("tangled like kelp," "rustling like wings"). There is no scaffolding, redundancy, or overwriting, even in the most descriptive passages. The final paragraph, in particular, demonstrates excellent sentence-level propulsion, bringing the story to a powerful close. It meets the 9+ quick test for its clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is evocative and skillfully crafted, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, there is a very high density of similes and a reliance on a limited palette of descriptors ("golden," "luminous," "silver") that occasionally feels like a stylistic template rather than organic description. This recurring pattern, while often beautiful, slightly dulls the propulsion in moments and constitutes a minor, persistent prose artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and precise for most of the story, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, the paragraph immediately following the climax leans slightly into summary and repetition. Lines like "He had done it. He had sealed the safekept starlight, and in doing so, he had found a way to translate heartbeats into maps" restate what was just powerfully shown, momentarily breaking the "show, don't tell" discipline that characterizes the rest of the piece. This is a minor blemish on an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is polished and highly effective, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. The prose is clean, with high information density and no discernible artifacts like loops or template cadence. A few of the conceptual phrases, while fitting, border on being slightly overwritten, a very minor drag on an otherwise excellent performance.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and rich with powerful imagery ("grotto’s damp throat," "whalebone reverie"). However, a few moments rely on slightly stock phrasing ("a sound like a heart breaking") that feel less fresh than the surrounding text. Additionally, some early paragraphs exhibit a subtle template cadence ("He’d come here to...", "His role was to...") that slightly tempers the narrative propulsion before the central action fully engages.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in its sensory descriptions. Sentences like "splitt[ing] into thin shavings that piled on the workbench like discarded seconds" are both beautiful and purposeful. The craft is nearly flawless, with varied syntax and strong verbs driving the momentum. There are no loops or significant artifacts to disrupt the flow.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, varied sentence structure, and evocative, precise imagery ("bruised violet and electric gold," "gears rusted into silence"). The rhythm is controlled, slowing for reflection and tightening during the confrontation. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating a professional level of line-by-line craft that propels the narrative beautifully.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean and controlled, but it leans heavily on abstract nouns and conceptual phrases ("functional resurrection," "equations for hope") where more concrete imagery would have been stronger. While free of major repetitive artifacts, the final paragraphs shift into telling and summarizing, which dulls the immediacy of the closing beat and feels less crafted than the earlier descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with a strong, varied rhythm and high information density. The figurative language is rich and generally effective at building the story's unique atmosphere. A few metaphors lean towards the familiar (e.g., "frozen lake," "tomb of stone"), which holds the prose back from absolute perfection, but there are no technical flaws or overwriting that impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, the momentum is occasionally slowed by abstract language and conceptual loops, particularly in the second half. Phrases like "the architecture of lies" and "shaping perception" are repeated, and the final paragraphs lean heavily on abstract nouns (revelation, clarity) instead of a concrete, sensory image, which slightly dulls the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and largely free of artifacts. Phrasing like "knots so complex they resembled coral reefs" and the "watercolor blur" of the fog-shrouded harbor demonstrates strong line-level craft. The piece is held back from a higher score by a few minor instances of cliché ("heart racing," "mind raced") and a tendency toward summary in the moment of epiphany. While very strong, these small imperfections slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is elegant but suffers from overwriting. The density of figurative language ("heart a map," "language of absence," "geography of healing") is high throughout, verging on a prose artifact. More damagingly, the final two paragraphs engage in paraphrase loops, restating the protagonist's newfound purpose three times, which significantly dulls the momentum of the otherwise strong closure.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, especially in its descriptions of the palace and the egg. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing (“burned like a dying star,” “frozen tear”) that softens its impact. The final sentence, “they began to assemble the future,” is an abstract summary that lacks the concrete, sensory power of the story’s best lines, ending on a conceptual note rather than a resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and imagistically rich, with a strong rhythm and high information density. Sentences like "The sand hissed like a secret" demonstrate superb line-level craft. The only weakness is in the final paragraph, where the move to explicit thematic summary ("Compassion, she thought...") reads as a moment of scaffolding that slightly dulls the propulsion into the final, more powerful image.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and polished, with strong imagery and a controlled, elegant rhythm. At times, the figurative language feels slightly overwrought, with a density of descriptors ("luminous skeptic," "bruised sky," "fractured starlight") that can feel more decorative than functional. While generally clear and propulsive, these moments slightly reduce the line-level economy and immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with evocative imagery and a controlled rhythm. The story avoids major artifacts like loops or scaffolding. The primary flaw is the tendency to summarize key moments, such as the flat statement "Lumin understood," and the final two paragraphs, which devolve into thematic explanation rather than letting the concrete action and images carry the meaning to a close.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with a strong rhythmic quality. The line-level craft is mostly successful, though a few figurative constructions lean toward the familiar (e.g., "shadows that danced like restless spirits"). The final line, while imagistically strong, concludes on the slightly stock phrase "in darkness, there was light," holding the prose back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. Sentence rhythm and variety are strong, propelling the narrative forward effectively. The primary flaw is the final sentence, which is redundant scaffolding that should have been cut to let the prior action and imagery complete the story.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong imagery like “skeletal finger against the night sky.” However, there is a minor recurring template for Elara’s reactions (“her mind racing,” “breath caught,” “heart raced”). This slight repetitiveness in expressing her internal state is a small artifact that prevents the otherwise excellent prose from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally evocative and clean, but it relies on expository summary for crucial world-building and methodological details (e.g., "Her method was predictive modeling..."). These moments of telling, rather than showing the "alchemy of data and intuition" in action, slow the momentum and reduce information density. The piece would be stronger if these concepts were integrated more dynamically into Lira's actions and immediate perceptions.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. Sentences are crafted with care, and word choice is precise. A few minor instances verge on being slightly overwritten or explanatory, such as the description of her deciphering method ("...a method she’d developed..."), which briefly breaks the immersive spell. However, there are no significant prose artifacts, loops, or momentum-dulling constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, with strong verbs and a deliberate rhythm that supports the somber atmosphere. However, there are moments of slight overwriting and repetition that could be tightened. The recurrence of "mirage of safety" and the near-paraphrase of "weaves truth carefully" feel slightly redundant, pulling back from the otherwise high level of concision and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally vivid and concise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Momentum is well-maintained, and there are no significant loops or scaffolding. The score is held back from the highest tier by a few instances of overwriting and mixed metaphors, such as "abrasive calm, a razor wrapped in silk," which momentarily detract from the otherwise clear and impactful line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its best moments ("The velvet library breathed in autumn’s hush"). Strong verbs and specific sensory details create a powerful atmosphere. There are, however, occasional slips into abstraction or slightly overwrought phrasing ("hatred etched itself into culture," "colliding and coalescing") that momentarily lessen the impact. These are minor but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely clean, vivid, and carries strong momentum. However, the final paragraph resorts to scaffold phrasing ("The first step, she knew...", "But tonight, she’d proven that...") and concludes with a platitude. These artifacts in the crucial final beat dull the otherwise sharp imagery and create a sense of summary rather than an earned, resonant close.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clear, concise, and carries a consistent rhythm that supports the story's fairy-tale-like atmosphere. Phrasing like "tastes like regret" and "the light turned golden and syrupy, as if the world were dipped in honey" demonstrates strong line-level craft. There are no significant loops or artifacts; the sentences propel the narrative forward with quiet confidence and high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with evocative imagery and a controlled, elegant rhythm. The prose is dense with meaning without feeling overwritten. The only minor imperfection is the inclusion of a few declarative, explanatory sentences in the final paragraph that summarize the thematic discovery, a form of light scaffolding that slightly weakens the otherwise powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong imagery in the opening and closing. Momentum is slightly impeded by a noticeable prose artifact: the list-like structure of "The first revelation... The second... The third..." reads like narrative scaffolding rather than an organic experience. This, combined with a few generic phrases like "hit Mara like a wave," detracts from an otherwise polished execution.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with precise, evocative language and a compelling rhythm. Lines like "a wound that heals by bleeding forever" are exceptional. However, a few minor phrases, such as the label-like "balancedly daring nature," slightly disrupt the otherwise immersive "show, don't tell" approach, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and rhythmic precision from the first sentence to the last. Figurative language is not ornamental but essential to the story's meaning and atmosphere. There are no wasted phrases, loops, or scaffolding; every line propels the narrative or deepens the emotional texture. The writing is clean, evocative, and demonstrates a level of polish that is immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density in most sentences. The rhythm is well-paced and the imagery is often strong. Minor deductions are for a few instances of slightly generic figurative language ("footprints in snow") and the repetition of the key phrase "rosewater dread," which, while effective, begins to feel like a label by its final use.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is evocative and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and imagery. However, a few moments rely on slightly common phrasing ("his eyes watering," "a wild, unfamiliar thing"). The repetition of "neatly inventive" feels slightly redundant, particularly its appearance in the final internal thought, which slightly lessens the impact of the "bleak exhilaration." These are minor issues in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and generally precise, with strong moments like the shadow that "pulsed like a diseased star." The rhythm and sentence structure support the story's momentum. The score is slightly limited by a few instances of genre cliché ("eyes like fractured glass," "bruise-colored sky") that, while functional, lack the sharpness seen elsewhere in the piece and prevent it from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often stunning, with powerful verbs and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language occasionally verges on overwriting, and the introduction of terms like "fractal generating" and "fractal rhythms" feels like a slight register drift into jargon that isn't fully earned by the story's internal logic. While the effect is largely successful, a touch more restraint would elevate it to the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative imagery and clear momentum. However, several moments of high tension rely on common clichés ("cold sweat broke out," "clutched to her chest") that slightly undermine the story's originality. While there are no major structural flaws like loops or scaffolds, these moments of stock phrasing prevent the line-level craft from matching the ingenuity of the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, with strong imagery ("softened into greenish folds"). Momentum is well-maintained through varied and purposeful sentence structures. A minor weakness lies in a few instances of summarizing internal processes, such as when Elara concludes she needs to "recontextualize" the truth, which tells the reader the thematic shift rather than fully embodying it in that beat.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and a varied, rhythmic sentence structure that propels the narrative. However, a few moments of overwriting slightly diminish its impact; phrases such as "stoically sensitive gaze" and "hushed blaze" feel self-conscious. These are minor flaws in an otherwise impeccable piece, but they prevent it from achieving flawless execution at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, a few key phrases feel overwrought or abstract, most notably "dappled resolve." The repetition of certain descriptors functions as a minor prose artifact that slightly dulls momentum. The final paragraph's shift towards summary also sacrifices some of the line-level propulsion established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a high density of imagery that builds a rich atmosphere. While the figurative language is consistently inventive, its sheer frequency borders on overwriting in a few places, slightly diminishing the impact of individual images. Nevertheless, the rhythm is controlled, the sentences are well-crafted, and there are no technical errors or momentum-killing loops to be found.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and often powerful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are minor instances of conceptual redundancy and jargon ("intangibly tangible") that feel more like labels than integrated descriptions. The concluding lines ("She was no longer a survivor. She was a seer. A disrupter.") summarize the change we just witnessed, slightly reducing the momentum of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms that create good momentum. Lines like "a crown of shadows" are evocative. The piece is held back by a few instances of stock sci-fi phrasing, such as a voice with "layered harmonics" or "a pull toward the unknown," which feel less specific than the rest of the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.9)
    While the prose is largely evocative and precise, the central discovery scene relies on a noticeable template cadence ("He knelt... He picked up... He closed his eyes... He opened his eyes... He continued his search..."). This repetitive sentence structure slightly dulls the momentum and creates a mechanical feel during a pivotal sequence, preventing the piece from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates a strong command of rhythm and sentence structure, resulting in high information density. The piece is highly polished. A minor drawback is that a few phrases, like "recycled mistakes into wisdom, her every move calibrated to the rhythm of regret and hope," feel slightly too abstract or self-consciously literary, momentarily pulling back from the scene's immediacy. Overall, however, the line-level craft is of a very high caliber with no technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it suffers from two notable issues. First, a high density of figurative language sometimes feels overwrought rather than sharp. Second, and more critically, the final two paragraphs contain paraphrase loops and thematic summaries ("But regret wasn’t a compass; it was a tide..."), which state the story's meaning directly and sap momentum from the powerful final image of her paddling away.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally avoids clutter, maintaining momentum. The imagery is often strong, particularly in the descriptions of the lake. There are minor instances of cliché ("eyes like fractured glass") or slightly awkward phrasing ("delicately robust"), but no significant loops or artifacts that obscure causality or dull the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmic, with strong imagery and high information density. A minor flaw appears in the final paragraphs, where the language shifts from concrete embodiment to abstract summary, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp line-level execution at the crucial point of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense and evocative, with figurative language that consistently deepens character and atmosphere rather than feeling ornamental. Sentences are constructed with a strong rhythmic control, varying in length and structure to manage momentum effectively. While the prose is consistently elevated, it avoids overwriting by grounding its most lyrical moments in concrete sensory details and actions.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates high information density. There is a slight artifact in the repetition of the phrase "like long-dried tears on faded photographs," which feels less like a deliberate motif and more like a recycled image. Additionally, the clichéd thematic summary at the climax represents a minor lapse in line-level precision.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and rhythmic, with strong word choice and varied sentence structures. Momentum is well-maintained. The piece is held back from the highest tier only by a few common phrasings ("heart full of other people’s troubles") that lack the sharp particularity of the surrounding text.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and generally clear, but it leans on familiar phrasing ("held its breath," "jaw tightened," "heart racing"). There are moments of over-writing, such as "the winking hush of their footsteps," which feels forced. The line introducing the cradle as "not a place but a idea" is immediately contradicted, creating a logical stumble at the prose level. Overall, it's competent but lacks the precision and freshness of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and clear, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the density of figurative language and poetic descriptors, especially in the opening paragraphs, borders on overwriting. This high texture, while often beautiful, can feel slightly labored and prevents the most critical images from landing with maximum impact due to a lack of contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and dense with powerful imagery. However, a few key moments are slightly marred by overwriting. Phrases like "a divine signature" and the direct explanation of "furiously tranquil" feel self-conscious. The final line, "let the storm kiss his wonder, raw and unfiltered," slips into sentimentality, softening the impact of an otherwise sharp and resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with strong imagery and rhythm. A significant flaw appears in the final two paragraphs, which lapse into summary ("The duel had been more than a clash of blades; it had been a collaboration..."). This scaffolding dulls the impact of the story's climax by telling the reader what to feel, rather than letting the final image do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with many memorable images. However, there is a slight tendency toward overwriting, where the density of figurative language feels more decorative than essential. The story also shows a minor reliance on a "He'd [verb]..." sentence structure in paragraphs of reflection, which could be varied for stronger momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Figurative language is strong and purposeful, particularly in the opening paragraph (“rose like a skeletal hand”). While a handful of phrases lean slightly ornate (“humming with the residual energy”), the piece is free of loops or artifacts, and the syntax drives momentum toward a sharp, impactful final line.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery that drives the story's atmosphere. The piece loses points for occasional overwriting and a few phrases that break the established tone. The line "beneath this empirically whimsical beauty" is a notable example of a register drift that feels more academic than fantastic, a minor but distracting flaw in otherwise polished craft.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and rich with strong imagery, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft. Sentences are constructed with care, and the language effectively builds atmosphere. The story occasionally verges on being overwritten, with a density of figurative language that can feel slightly excessive, and the final sentences drift into a summary that acts as a minor scaffold instead of letting the final image do its work alone.


== Grader: Grok 4 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm in metaphors like dust as stellar debris; no significant loops or artifacts obscure closure. Strength in propulsion through integrated details, but occasional overwriting in similes like "iridescent and weightless" adds minor scaffold without harming the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control; minor scaffold (“the emptiness had grown heavier” twice) and a mixed metaphor (“weight…press against her chest until…urge to encroach”) slightly dull the peak.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythm and information density; sentences advance multiple jobs. Minor scaffold: “the farm hummed like a living organism” is serviceable but not fresh. No loops or mixed metaphors in peak beats. Clean mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose shows selective, sensor-driven precision without purple drift; no adjacent paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Rhythm flexes with mood: short declaratives during activation (“Then it stopped”) contrast against the earlier slow-mo hallucination sentence. Filter verbs minimal. The occasional elevated clause (“a woman kneeling, her hands pressed to the earth”) is purposeful cadence heightening rather than clutter. Final line is crisp, evocative, leaves image rather than summary.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.7)
    "moth-eaten ferns frond" typo and stacked metaphors ("dust motes as stellar debris") cause text-artifact clutter; strong propulsion in dust analysis beats, yet "entropy spoke in weeks" violates physical logic, dulling closure density.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density (e.g., "breath fogging the air" conveys physiology, setting, emotion). Minor deduction for triple "or" in "numbers or maps or something older," slightly blunting momentum in a key discovery beat without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("She screamed for help..." vs. lyrical "unshaken marvels" description). Metaphors serve character ("tuning forks gleaming like captured starlight"), and final line recharges the opening with "silence was not an absence but a presence."

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops/scaffold; "glass fractured like a spider’s web" exemplifies textural specificity; "memory pierced him" slightly overwritten but redeemed by immediate tactile action (shard in palm).

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.8)
    No loops or scaffold; "hope frayed like old rope" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor flaw: "fear won't feed us. Trust will" slightly pat but redeemed by immediate action. Final line crystallizes closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor template cadence in "breath visible... vial labeled... memory surfaced" (−0.2); "half-truths" slightly stock, but final image’s "glow of unused love, finally found" achieves zero scaffold with high density.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor scaffolding in high-pressure beat ("she believed, were keys"; "visions surged, overwhelming her") slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, high density ("garden shuddered. Vines retracted") and vivid verbs ("pixelate," "unraveled") propel momentum without closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero scaffold or loops; sentences like "The dry soil outside began to tremble, as if waking from a long sleep" fuse propulsion with texture. "Staggering grace" triggers mild stock phrasing (-0.2), but final beats avoid figurative muddle. Glass vial’s "shimmering like liquid starlight" shows textural specificity without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor modifier stacking ("spectral light that seeped... like liquid mercury") and near-synonym repetition ("residual warmth of forgotten fires") dull closure propulsion without obscuring cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops, but "casting amber streaks" risks simultaneity error. High density falters slightly in "reinterpreted the rules" (elevated diction), though final image’s "wind chimes" metaphor resonates cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose maintains propulsion with vivid specificity ("drip of melting ice, each drop echoing like a ticking clock"), but "heart less frozen" edges toward cliché, dulling the closure’s emotional precision by 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.5)
    Near-zero loops with high density ("ink blurred by time and tears"), but "vulnerability is power" statement in climax triggers thematic echo penalty. Final line's slight generality prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with minimal artifacts, though "mild obsession" repetition creates subtle loop. Figurative language serves pressure ("undulating like wave’s crest"), but "symbols dissolved when stared at too long" slightly overwrites. Closure lines immaculate: "silence would wait... for next oracle."

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero prose artifacts; "fractal, repeating in layers" exemplifies high-density propulsion, though "raw material of thought" edges toward abstraction in one high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density (“doodled a lens in the margin, a silent invitation”) propels momentum, but “cryptic doodles: spirals, broken lines” uses colon unnaturally for Elias’s voice, causing minor register drift in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    No closure artifacts; high density ("mended deception" crystallizes theme economically). Minor redundancy in "cracked and chipped, yet polished" creates a 0.2 loop, but final line recharges "wounds" with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with propulsion, but "skeletal frame bathed in muted lavender glow" overwrites in high-pressure beat. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet lyrical excess in setup slightly slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold. Sentences do triple duty: "lanterns dimmed, and the theater sighed" merges setting, atmosphere, and closure. Final line recharges opening "hush" with "create from the silence," avoiding figurative muddle. Propulsion flawless—"gush of water surged" accelerates crisis without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "smudged graphite" embodies her struggle. Final line’s "auroral sorrow... felt whole" avoids overwriting while charging closure. One slight abstraction ("certainties had begun to sway") prevents 9.0, but no figurative muddle in peak beats maintains propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "hush that followed a sudden confession" exemplifies fresh metaphor. Rhythm varies perfectly (staccato action vs lyrical closure). Near-miss with "mechanical whispers" generic phrasing redeemed by literal valve voice.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "paper brittle yet stubborn" exemplifies high-density prose, though "crumbling peace" slightly borders on mixed metaphor in the library description—no artifact dulls the closure's "river flowed on, unburdened" final line.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("ridge plunged into darkness" conveys time, place, mood). Final line’s specificity ("lifelong wonder") charges closure without sentimentality. Minor artifact: "softly adaptive" label appears twice without tactical cost, slightly dulling peak-beat immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.3)
    No loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or revelation. "Sensitively perceptive gaze" is lone minor artifact—elevated diction slightly clashes with historian's embodied actions during high-pressure probing.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops/scaffold; "silver blade" cliché is lone artifact. High density: "dipped her brush into a jar of ink" conveys craft/storm tension. Final line’s "hands steady once more" recharges opening motif without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero prose artifacts; high density where every line advances atmosphere or tension ("time folded like origami"). Figurative language ("silence but the absence of noise") remains coherent in peak beats. Final line's resonance ("shepherd of paradoxes") earned through prior particulars.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless density ("amber and violet" hues doing triple duty), but "exhaustion loomed like a thief" constitutes a minor scaffold loop that dulls urgency in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose achieves textural density with purposeful rhythm ("rain pattered against cobblestones"), yet paraphrase loops in timeline descriptions ("some happy, some broken") dilute momentum near closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; every sentence multi-tasks ("warped wood of the phonograph, its brass horn caked in dust"). High density with clear propulsion—"palimpsest of emotion" crystallizes concept without muddle. Minor tell ("emotional numbness, the doctors called it") quickly embodied in physical sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold in paragraph 3 ("He’d been followed... Not by people, exactly") causes -0.2 loop penalty. Otherwise high density: "parchment curl into ash" compresses thematic payoff. Final line’s rhythm ("Elias knew...") avoids drumbeat. No artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops but slight overwriting in "crystal shadows dancing across walls" during high-pressure beat. Information density strong though "silver vapor rose, twisting like a ghost" edges toward stock imagery. Final line propulsion impeccable.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero prose artifacts; "rusted compass" does triple duty (character, setting, symbol). Sentences vary rhythm ("He unrolled the frayed rope...") while avoiding overwriting. Final line avoids sentimentality through concrete image ("spiral" with "unbroken thread").

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; high density ("music pooled in hollows of the world"); "tarnished surface glowing faintly" charges closure. Slight overwriting in "chronic hush... transformed" (0.3 deduction) but no closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose avoids loops but contains minor scaffold ("professionally thorough nature demanded...") in high-pressure beats. Final line achieves textural density ("grotto hummed with quiet satisfaction"), though "static-laden air" slightly overwrites Lira's reaction moment.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "mind looping between numbers and the ache of unspoken things" followed by "restless" repetition dulls momentum. Figurative language stays clean in peak beats, but the "compassion, like the sea" metaphor verges on patness without deeper integration.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffolding, though adjacent lines about shifting light ("colors that shifted with angle of light"/"follow the angles") create a mild paraphrase loop that dulls momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("waves moved backward, then forward, then sideways") slightly dulls momentum, but otherwise high density ("snores stretched into deafening roar") and no figurative muddle in peak beats. Final line’s rhythm charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero scaffolding; every line advances atmosphere or emotional charge. High-density prose ("fruit that shimmered like liquid starlight" → "pulsing in time with her heartbeat") avoids figurative muddle. Final line’s active verbs ("bring," "place," "let") propel closure without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong propulsion with zero closure artifacts, yet adjacent beats repeat "methodical" (routine/mind) creating a subtle scaffold loop; no figurative muddle but slight synonym churn in describing pipe chases.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; "rain pattered, moss swelling" varies syntax to propel scene. "Circuitously sincere" appears three times but pattern-teaches meaning escalation (admiration → explanation → shared mantra), avoiding overwriting penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    "Haggard awe prickled Marin’s skin" edges toward therapy-speak, and "slanting sheets" of rain risks overwritten texture, but rhythmic control in the closure beats ("world wasn’t a puzzle to solve") offsets minor scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "shards swirling like glitter in a storm" exemplifies textural density. Slight scaffold in setup ("Elara had made it her home... drawn by promise") deducts—redundant to later magic demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold or loops; high density in phrases like "fractured like shattered glass" propels momentum—yet "reactively visionary" appears twice as label-only description, slightly muddling the valve’s tangible role in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; lines like "arrows pulsed with a rhythm that matched his own heartbeat" advance character and atmosphere. Slight density risk in "skeletal remains of an old clocktower" is offset by payoff in the chamber's stained-glass hologram.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.5)
    "Entangled memories" label and "unheard symphony" refrain create synonym loops; "whales’ calls rose in pitch" followed by "songs swelled" exemplifies paraphrase redundancy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose propulsion falters slightly in mid-story with near-duplicate phrasing ("hum in his bones" → "hum became a roar"), but strategic density shines elsewhere. Final line’s "prismatic light winking out like a final, defiant star" risks sentimentality yet avoids it through earned thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but "bitter, metallic, like blood" leans cliché; paraphrase loops in "wait actively" repetition (three beats) deduct 0.3. Final line’s "echo of a con artist’s honest child" rescues closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    Closure beat’s "enduring magic of time" muddles cost with abstraction. Figurative strings in final paragraph dull propulsion where density should peak.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion except "Kael filtered reality differently" scaffold line; figurative language ("shadows stretching like living things") avoids muddle but the "tides marking time" repetition slightly dilutes density in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("brittle and sad, like a memory trying to reform"). Minor register drift in "ephemeral compass" (slightly academic for peak beat) prevents 9.5+, but closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "chip’s weight felt heavier" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor register drift in "intuition hummed" (abstract for peak tension) costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "golden gas that danced" exemplifies high-density lyricism without muddle. Final "dawnlit melancholy" phrase borders abstraction but saved by concrete archival payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "prismatic hues on the walls" and "magnetic calm" deepen motif without muddle. Final line’s "mended the invisible, one patch at a time" delivers propulsion and closure weight in nine words—no figurative excess in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero prose artifacts: "streak of gray against iron sky" and "ghostly plume" avoid mixed metaphors. Sentence propulsion through concrete verbs ("chipped," "crawled," "traced"). Final line's "falcon laughed" achieves high-density lyricism without sacrificing clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("crumbling wall"/"crumbling archway") and "wild hush" repetition (3x) reduce density. Final paragraph’s "bridge between past and future" slightly overwrites without advancing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose avoids fatal loops but "hush" repetition (5x in climax) creates subtle redundancy; final image ("lonesome splendor of release") achieves crystalline propulsion despite minor cadence drag in memory sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor density issues in "vines of light creeping" beat slightly blur immediacy. Otherwise, zero loops; "copperlight repose" evolves with purpose. Final line’s "silent and proud" ghost crystallizes cost without telling.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "shrouded in endless night, where frost clung..." opens with slight overwriting; final line ("laughter lingered—a sound of mournful elation") achieves resonant propulsion without closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "damp stone and older, sweeter things—memories, perhaps" exemplifies high-density propulsion; minor figurative muddle in "mouth full of silence" but no closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold dilutes momentum: "purposeful but unhurried, gathering stones, clearing debris, tracing the old paths" repeats intent without pressure. No closure-impacting artifacts, but "curiosity was a compass, caution a shield" verges on abstract telling in a high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("boots clicking like a countdown" advances plot and emotion). Minor cliché ("breath hitched") in peak beat prevents 9.0, but final line ("rhythm as timeless as chalk spirals") avoids sentimentality through concrete image. No figurative muddle in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.9)
    Zero scaffold loops and high density ("stitch out of place, and the whole pattern unravels"), but "wind chimes" simile feels clichéd and "constellations of dust" borders on overwriting in high-tension beats; final line’s cadence elevates closure.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion and density; one paraphrase loop ("fierce tenderness" x3) triggers -0.2 but avoids closure impact, preserving high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    Filter-verb stacks ("she wondered," "she realized") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; otherwise exceptional density with no figurative muddle in closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero scaffold or loops; high density throughout ("prisms, mirrors, stolen sunbeam" does triple duty). Final line "Everything" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Sentence rhythm varies organically with scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances story through high-density prose ("petals tremble or stones hum"), with peak-beat clarity during the mural’s revelation—no figurative muddle, only purposeful cadence shifts matching the sound wave motif.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.3)
    No fatal loops, but "sweet, musky scent" feels checklist-y. "Living arrow" phrase achieves high density; minor overwriting ("chaos converged into symphony") barely touches climax.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "half-sung lullabies clung like second skin" exemplifies textural density, but "shyly unstoppable certainty" is weak phrasing that slightly dulls the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or character (“bamboo grove that vanished when the last rainforest sighed”). Figurative language (“liquid light”) remains concrete and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Final line’s “hummed back” crystallizes closure with rhythmic propulsion and irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "mothball-scented vault" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor paraphrase loop in backstory ("before paths diverged, before silence...") triggers -0.2, but closure beats remain clean with strong verbs ("unsnarled," "clutched").

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with propulsion until final third: "dappled resolve" creates mixed metaphor (shimmering + volcanic glass), dulling closure. Template cadence ("She unrolled... She measured... She traced") in decryption beat. Filter-verbs acceptable but "knew the adhesive held more than residue" tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "sunlight filtering in golden haze" exemplifies textural specificity. Final line’s poetic compression ("echo humming in his veins") avoids muddle because earlier beats established this lyric mode. Information density propels every sentence without figurative clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero text loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("kaleidoscopic shadows... planks seem alive") with clear propulsion. Minor figurative muddle in "residual energy, a hush so thick it felt like drowning" slightly obscures physical stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=9.4)
    No loops or scaffold; "shadowseam wonder" earns abstraction through concrete setup. Sentence rhythm varies organically ("She studied... mapping constellations"). One minor register drift: "softly ingenious" feels detached from POV.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    No closure-touching artifacts, but "her purpose was to collect" (telling) and minor scaffold in the conjecture explanation reduce density. Figurative language remains coherent and purpose-driven even in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion; minor paraphrase loop ("lightly attentive gaze... cataloging reactions") prevents 9.0. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats—fountain’s "rainbow hues" woven into action.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold, high density ("luminescent mist, bare feet sinking into moss that pulsed like a second heartbeat"), but "pulsed like a second heartbeat" edges toward bodily cliché in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.7)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("commune with the world... commune with the bay") and thematic echo ("read between lines" repeated verbatim) dull momentum. Final paragraph slightly overwrites ("clear complexity"), but closure beat remains clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.1)
    No loops or scaffold; "frost-laced gravel" and "glacial melt" achieve high density without muddle. Slight overwriting in "liquid silver" sand but justified by closure payoff. Final line’s "belonged in their rhythm" avoids sentimentality through concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "cerulean from the world where..." uses intentional repetition to build pattern density; final line’s compression ("mouth about to speak. Elara listened") achieves crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "brittle paper, melted wax, the jagged edge" risks synonym churn; near-flawless density where every image charges closure (glowing ashes → warm locket).

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "prism parapet shimmered as sound waves danced" integrates action/image without scaffold. Minor density in mirror descriptions avoids muddle; final line ("woman with Lirael’s eyes smiled") resolves with textural precision.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level propulsion falters with "operatively gentle" repetition and "slow dance" overuse; otherwise vivid cadence ("shadows stretching like a bridge") avoids loops until final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with propulsion ("gloved hand—a relic..."). Minor register drift in "rare, genuine curve of his lips" avoids penalty but prevents 9.5+; closure beat remains pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    Beautiful cadence overall, but adjacent lines loop "snowflake" imagery ("each flake fell like a whispered secret"/"testament to quiet defiance"), triggering paraphrase redundancy in high-pressure beats without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "meteor hush" reappears with reweighted meaning. One hairline slip: "serifed verses smooth as lies" tells rather than shows the compromise in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    "Her chest tight with emotion" risks label-only feeling; minor redundancy in "world above the clouds was quiet." Otherwise pristine propulsion—no loops, metaphors serve pressure ("wings slicing like a hymn").

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.8)
    No loops or scaffold; "faintly, then brighter" avoids paraphrase via kinetic escalation. "Memory was a braid of light and shadow" risks abstraction but redeemed by rope’s physical reweaving. Final line’s cadence shift ("illuminated the past, not with fire, but with light") propels closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold in climax; "raindrops clung to lashes like diamonds" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor paraphrase loop: "decay and renewal" recurs with slight variation. No figurative muddle, but "fractals of symbol" risks purple prose (-0.1).

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; propulsion through concrete verbs ("dissolved," "clutched"). One hairline slip: "sandstone arches framing a sky streaked with amber/violet" slightly overwrites in calm moment, but closure beat ("edges biting into her palm") stays lean.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "time bending like taffy" risks density slip with consecutive similes. Zero scaffold in closure beat, though "flicker of understanding" skirts abstraction (saved by tactile "whisper of release").

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or overwriting; "frost-kissed leaves like second skin" achieves triple duty (sensory, setting, theme). Only minor artifact: "faint scent of starlight" slightly strains physical logic but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "mossy cradle" and "dappled light" exemplify textural specificity, though "liquid starlight" edges toward ornamental magic without mid-scene cost demonstration.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold in closure beat; "quiet, brightened disquiet" achieves high density. Slight overwriting in "roots anchored in soil that pulsed with faint blue glow" (redundant "faint") prevents 9.0 despite strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops; high density with "spine opening to hollow filled with live spiders" as peak-beat specificity. "Carefully resourceful" label slightly over-tells but redeemed by embodied actions like pocketing orchid.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero scaffold or loops; every sentence multiplies meaning: "calliope swallowed by vines" implies time and decay, "petal labeled *Lira Veyra-Born*" merges identity and theme. Final line's "promise of stories" recharges fog motif with earned hope. No figurative muddle—even high-pressure beats ("ship shuddered") use active verbs without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "her fingers deftly untangling and reweaving the threads" slightly loops action. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, though "distorted, elongated form" borders generic. Final line ("gears humming smoothly") crystallizes closure without artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "shattering ancient hymns" shows not tells dissonance. High density: "petals like pressed glass" conveys bloom’s nature efficiently. Final line recharges motif without muddle. Cost shown via physical detail ("ribs no longer aching") not abstract telling.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; high density ("shattered panes rattled like skeletal wind chimes" ties setting/theme). Final line variation ("But she didn’t need to.") creates propulsion. "Skeletal wind chimes" slightly mixed metaphor (bones don’t chime) prevents 9.5, but no closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Near-zero scaffolding with high density ("puddles reflecting fractured sky" does triple duty); minor artifact in "stones holding breath" cliché and em-dash misuse in "vibrations—a collective memory" dull closure proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; peak-beat density crystallizes action/emotion/theme: "knot’s flame had spread... bloomed violently." Final line’s rhythm ("defy gravity—not by escaping it, but by becoming fire") recharges motif with perfect propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "moonlight fractured on the surface" does triple duty (image/mood/metaphor). Minor paraphrase loop in "warmly observant" descriptions (para 1/5) avoids peak beats. Final line crystallizes closure without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density in "gilded hush" passages, but "intangibly tangible" appears twice in final third as unearned thematic echo, triggering -0.5 artifact penalty that dulls closure image per Text-Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "lap of water against hull" exemplifies textural specificity. Figurative language ("vaulting hush enveloped her") enhances rather than obscures pressure. Micro-deduction for "clouding or clearing to indicate turbulence" slightly abstract in one mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose achieves high density with resonant verbs ("pulsed faintly," "humming with ancient energy"), but minor scaffold appears in lore keeper description ("studying prophecies while refusing to let fear paralyze her"). No loops or figurative muddle, though "cathedral of shadows" slightly strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density: "burned bridges carefully, each severed tie a ritual" compresses backstory and motivation. Avoids loops but "fading threshold pulsed, a heartbeat in the darkness" risks cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("hummed," "vibrated," "trembled"). Minor density dip in opening ("existential dread into resilience") but no closure artifacts. Final line recharges "shadowseam" with devastating economy.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "golden shadows softened, and Lirael realized she was crying" achieves triple duty (action/emotion/image). Figurative language sparse but precise in peak beats. "Bridge of intuition" phrasing slightly abstract yet doesn't dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops in closure beats, but "reality shifted" repetition creates paraphrase loop in escalation. "Shivering bliss" borders on therapy-speak yet avoids penalty by charging final image with concrete sensation.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless density: "brass surface tarnished but still bearing" does triple duty. Minor abstraction in "tactfully hopeful" slightly dulls immediacy. Zero loops; final line "began to write" avoids overwriting while recharging the button motif.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    "Molten gold that seemed to swallow the horizon" creates mixed metaphor; template cadence in action beats ("Mara pulled... Mara shrugged"). Non-closure accumulation cap (-1.5) for two distinct artifacts near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minimal artifacts, but "vested hush" repetition (3x) creates synonym churn; prophecy dialogue's abstract nouns ("the veil thins") clash with Elias's embodied POV in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels atmosphere or action ("dust speck glowed brighter, its light weaving through the monuments like a thread" merges image, pressure, and payoff without muddle).

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "leaves sharp as knives" charges action without muddle. Slight register drift in "improvise, he told himself" tells where showing could deepen pressure, but propulsion remains relentless to final seed-sowing.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "wavered, translucent and shimmering" slightly loops with "woven from starlight." No closure artifacts, but minor redundancy in Lira's description deducts 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("modestly fearless" variants) and borderline overwritten phrase ("sky bled gold") deduct 0.2, but zero scaffold in closure beat preserves propulsion toward the tooth’s pulse.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops but "proprioceptive enhancements" label repeats without fresh embodiment in beat 3. Strap's "edges biting" provides crucial closure texture, though "ultraviolet penance" risks thematic echo.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; high density ("dust motes swirling... spelled a forgotten language" advances plot and theme). Minor metaphor muddle in "edges sharp yet soft, like a thought half-formed" during climax deducts 0.1, but clarity remains intact for closure.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with propulsion ("plunging the ticket office into dim, blue-gray haze"), but paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "skillfully observant" repeats identically, and "weightless burden" appears twice without deepening. Final line’s "less lonely" avoids sentimentality yet slightly over-tells; subtle image shift would heighten charge.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level propulsion excels ("bottled whisper shattered, its hum crescendoing into a roar"), but "pages flapping like wings" creates a mixed metaphor (mechanical press vs. organic motion). Minor scaffold in "her hands moving with preternatural speed" slightly dulls immediacy; no artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; high density ("shard, sharp as regret") with rhythmic propulsion. Deducted 0.2 for near-duplicate: "refracting it into prismatic shards that danced" followed by "danced across spires" within 15 words—minor scaffold in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; “syrup of sound” risks mixed metaphor but pays off as patterned textural density. Final line (“mended not what was torn”) achieves crystalline propulsion, though “glass weep” edges toward cliché without full reinvention.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor density issue in climax: "gritty like sand... smooth like water" creates mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but "shattering into diamond dust" slightly overwrites closure image. Propulsion strong despite poetic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.6)
    No scaffold or loops, but "credibly curious" drifts toward label-speak and "fractal patterns" slightly overwrites. Final line’s repetition ("listening, always listening") earns lyricism through concrete prior action, avoiding sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Exquisite rhythm ("stars burned so close you could almost touch their light") but scaffolded phrases ("flourishing stillness" ×3) and "patient as stone" cliché trigger −0.2, blocking 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor overwriting ("flickering shapes in the corners of his vision" – redundant imagery); otherwise clean propulsion. "Pulse, as if alive" slightly strains metaphor but pays off in closure without muddling causality.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.1)

    Zero loops; "copper on oak" reprise in the final line achieves high-density closure. Minor comma splice ("her tone brazen calm") is stylistic and unobtrusive, preserving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "luminous skeptic" does triple duty. Final line ("door creaked open") recharges tower motif with precision. No figurative muddle in peak beats—amber's "golden mist" serves closure without purple prose. Rhythm varies naturally from lyrical openings to staccato climax ("Then it stopped").

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but minor scaffold: "brittle shells cracking open to release tiny, pale roots" has redundant descriptors. No closure-tainting loops, yet figurative density ("sky bled from orange to indigo") slightly obscures action flow.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "tinted revelations" in Jeb's dialogue risks thematic echo. Final line's "hum of connection" avoids sentimentality through concrete "grooves" imagery. No loops, yet "wild hush" repetition borders on overuse in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed" parchment edges and "dulled by decades of neglect" exemplify textural specificity; final line "his heart quiet" resolves opening "echoed silence" with crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "teardrop" pawn description slightly generic but compensated by strong propulsion. Final paragraph shows cost through "weight lift"/"steps light" without telling. One borderline artifact: "otherworldly light" risks purple prose but justified by spire's magic.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-duplicate metaphors ("whispers grew louder"/"luminous absence") create minor density muddle in high-pressure beats. Otherwise zero loops, with "soft click" demonstrating crystalline propulsion at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Dust motes swirled like tiny galaxies" and "bioluminescent fungi" verge on generic fantasy tropes, diluting specificity. No scaffold loops, but "hidden thunder" creates a minor mixed metaphor (thunder isn’t hidden). Final image’s propulsion ("peak glowed silver light") compensates. Figurative muddle in one peak beat blocks 8.8+.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffolding; "fidgeted productively" exemplifies fresh diction. Minor loop in "frozen in expressions... frozen in a rush" deducts in high-stakes closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor density issues: "grudges festered like wounds" is cliché, "forged hush" mixes metaphors. No closure-tainting artifacts; strategic telling ("ritual was a lie") compresses backstory without momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold in climax beats; "storm of gold and glass" slightly overwrites but pays off in closure; minor cliché ("tears stinging") avoided fatal artifact penalty by being tethered to physical action.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong density overall, but paraphrase loop in transition ("footsteps echoed... tunnel forked") and template cadence in path description cost 0.3.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "salt and time" streaking tower exemplifies textural specificity. Sentence rhythm accelerates during climax ("vial cork glowed steady, a tiny beacon") then breathes in closure. "Silent scream of tenderness" risks purple prose but works contextually as Elara’s internal metaphor. Final line ("proof was in the silence") crystallizes theme without abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal artifacts, but paraphrase loop: "raw solace of the task" immediately followed by "sweat dripping into eyes" redundantly conveys effort; no figurative muddle, yet "drowned harbors" subtly echoes earlier "drowned by rising seas," slightly dulling closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lean and rhythmic ("orchard hung... like a chandelier of green"), but "truth curdled in the air" mixes metaphors, slightly muddling clarity in a high-pressure beat near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; “brittle as moth wings” exemplifies textural specificity. Edelweiss reprise in final line recharges meaning cleanly. Minor abstraction in “gaps” phrase redeemed by concrete “child’s laughter” payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)

    Zero loops with high density; "ozone and something older, sharper—a lacy menace" has minor paraphrase scaffold but no closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; high density ("shards of cooled lava" implies explosions). Varied syntax accelerates during engine hum. Figurative language purposeful ("moth in amber"). "Scientifically romantic" slightly abstract but anchored in action.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops in closure beat; "jealousy coiled... green-eyed monster" redundancy in high-pressure moment deducts 0.3 per artifact screen.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops with high propulsion, but "humanize the inanimate" is abstract telling in high-pressure beat. Final line risks sentimentality ("learning to weave") yet saved by concrete antecedents. Figurative language sparse and purposeful—no muddle in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "feared he’d miscalculated. Then, the rune flared" slightly dulls momentum, but high density prevails. "Liquid starlight" metaphor sustains logic without muddle, and final line’s "world held its breath" crystallizes closure with zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "refracting it into prismatic shards" in high-pressure beat muddles figurative density. Otherwise, propulsion and specificity (e.g., "viscous drop") excel without artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Near-flawless prose with vivid specificity, but triplet structure ("weight of silence, thickness of twilight, tremble of anticipation") creates subtle rhythm loop. No artifacts in peak beats; final image’s lyrical density avoids muddle while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "projecting a crimson dot... revealing flaws only a spatially gifted mind could parse." Figurative language ("smooth as mycelium") avoids muddle, and final line’s "quiet wildfire" resonates. Minor deduction: "conceptual" barrier perception edges toward abstraction, but rhythmic propulsion ("He stepped through") compensates for length.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops in peak beats; "mica pane flickering" to "lantern’s flame danced" shows evolving use without redundancy. Minor synonym churn in "damp paper and old regrets" → "ozone and iron" slightly dilutes momentum but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops/scaffold; "wind through a shattered window" avoids cliché with textural specificity. High density: "flickering bulbs in a utility tunnel that smelled of damp earth" advances setting, character, and mood simultaneously. Rhythm accelerates during calls ("frayed at edges... softer now") without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.0)
    Template cadence in climax ("as Kael’s signs grew... as the music intertwined...") dulls immediacy. "Joyful sorrow" is therapy-speak; metaphor strain when waves "respond" to signing violates physical logic in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; obsidian ink description exemplifies concrete propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop ("She’d stolen... She’d gone") prevents 9.5+, but closure imagery remains razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush with rhythmic variation ("cerulean for joy, violet for regret"), but minor artifacts weaken closure: "my chest ache" breaks POV consistency, and "auroral sorrow" repeats without evolution. No scaffold loops, though the lagoon description leans slightly list-like in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("static hum," "slammed like thunder") with propulsion. Final line ("door opened") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose excels in specificity ("frayed cord," "chipped blue shutters") but suffers paraphrase loops: "refracting them into patterns only she could see" echoes earlier mirror descriptions. Near-overwriting in "thrummed with unseen currents" slightly muddles tension without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops in peak beats, but paraphrase-loop in "hush where past meets prophecy" (opening/reprise) triggers -0.2. High density ("moss-dusted stone," "fleeting hopes") fuels propulsion, though "prophecy" repetition slightly dulls closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Combative tenderness" and "strange, liberating calm" inject label-speak into peak beats, dulling embodied cost. Otherwise clean propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Minor abstraction in high-pressure moments blocks 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high density ("petals crumbled... scattering like ash") with zero loops, but "hollow laughter" and "polishing is an act of defiance" contain stock phrasing that dulls closure's edge. Final image propulsion is immaculate.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops, but "tremor of certainty" repetition in final third creates subtle synonym churn; "soft glowing dust" slightly overwrites the pivotal transformation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose sings with textural specificity ("prismatic shadows," "leaves rustling in a language he almost understood"), but "thousand shades of green" edges toward purple prose in high-stakes beat, slightly muddling the fractal revelation's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong rhythm in opening, but high-pressure cave scene suffers from stacked metaphors ("raw and ancient," "prickled," "symphony") creating figurative muddle. "Sandpaper/silk" abstraction replaces embodied sensation precisely where density should heighten.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "pulsed with memory of laughter" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language serves pressure ("time pooled like mercury") without muddle. Final line—"subdued ardor burning brighter"—achieves crystalline closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but high-density figurative language ("glass dripped like a thousand inverted hourglasses") risks overwriting in early beats; no artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.1)
    Masterful density until climax where "anguished joy of the moment" creates mixed metaphor (joy can't be anguished), and three consecutive "she had..." sentences form template cadence. Final-third artifacts cap all categories at 8.8 per rubric.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.6)
    No loops or scaffold; high density ("spines rearranging into new titles" does triple duty). "Hunger—not for destruction" slightly overwrites embodied sensation, but final image’s propulsion saves peak beat. Zero artifacts in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "velvet cloth, its iridescent scales catching starlight" demonstrates multi-jobbing language; minor scaffold in "convictions had always been fragile" but no loops or artifacts, especially in high-pressure reconstruction beat.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; "rust-caked roots" and "bioluminescent light" show textural specificity. Minor scaffold: "she believed that if she could decode..." dilutes momentum. Strength: final line recharges opening motif with "wind through different trees" cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.8)
    Duplicate "shoreline lullaby" line in paragraphs 1 and 4 constitutes paraphrase loop in final third, triggering -1.7 penalty. Overwritten descriptions ("bruised twilight sky") dilute momentum; "honey and regret" taste lacks sensory plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero prose artifacts: "rusted and stubborn bolt required precise twist" shows rather than tells; "frostbitten hope" avoids sentimentality via concrete "thawed cobalt walls." Final paragraph’s "garden" metaphor integrates flawlessly with prior action (child’s music). Highest-band rarity for line-level control in short form.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor artifact: "regally unpretentious" appears as label without embodied demonstration, creating slight thematic dissonance. Otherwise, high density ("skin peeling away to reveal hollow shell") and clear propulsion. No loops; final line recharges constellation motif with earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold loops, but "periodically eternal" repetition creates paraphrase redundancy; "bleeding white" motif avoids muddle yet slightly over-tells the coral transformation in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; propulsion via strong verbs ("ripped," "thrashed"). "Liquid gold" cliché is lone flaw, but offset by fresh specifics ("ozone and iron"). Closure image ("storm gathering") avoids sentimentality with precise, charged phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density like "kite’s tail fluttered... wounded bird" advances plot. Final line "insurgent grandmother" has crystalline cadence. No figurative muddle even in high-pressure digging scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("velvet lining torn, cards scattered like shattered mirrors") advances atmosphere and character. Final image’s propulsion ("portrait breathed") avoids figurative muddle, with rhythm varying purposefully for closure’s charge.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor paraphrase loop in elders' warning ("Time slows here because it *chooses* to" echoes prior line) but no artifacts in peak beats. High density: "spill the ink... read the truth in the shapes before they vanished" compresses method/stakes. Final line ("stepped inside") crystalline with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.6)
    No prose loops or scaffold, but "bravely conflicted" diagnostic label in two peak beats (-0.4) and "frantic drumbeat" cliché dilute line-level precision; final image propulsion remains uncompromised.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-zero artifacts; "fractured starlight" and "symphony of containment" avoid purple prose by serving pressure. One elevated phrase ("senselessly perceptive") risks abstraction but is immediately grounded in rose tremors. Final line’s "revolution" recharges the sandbag scrap without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops and high density except "grief, longing, and a strange, feral hope" using label-only emotions in peak beat. Minor artifact prevents 9+ but closure beat remains sharp with "single note echoed... lingered like memory" propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "gears grinding like celestial heartbeat" avoids cliché through action-driven rhythm. Final line’s "orbits of regret still spun" achieves textural specificity without muddle. Minor deduction for one near-duplicate ("spidery handwriting"/"faint coffee stain" proximity).

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold loops; "fractal patterns on the walls" shows textural specificity without muddle; minor register drift in "rewrote itself, guilt dissolving" slightly elevates diction beyond Lira's stressed POV during high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "grains swirling like tiny dancers" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor risk: "lilac-hued glow" / "lilac unease" borders on repetition but charges tone purposefully.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero fatal artifacts; "warm coldness" repetition slightly over-ornaments but doesn’t obscure closure. Minor scaffold in "He reached... his fingers brushing" costs 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("knelt," "dipped," "clung") and high-density imagery ("liquid storm" of spores); metaphors ("palimpsest of emotions") serve pressure without muddle, though "factually mystical" slightly drifts into thematic label in a high-stakes beat.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats but "liquid canyon" metaphor slightly violates physical logic. Final line's "hands steady, heart light" risks emotional flatlining after revelation; minor cadence dip in reflection paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "mist clinging like a second skin" shows textural specificity without muddle. One near-overwritten beat ("codes in accumulated snow—meltwater...") avoids penalty via payoff in thematic density.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; sentence rhythm varies perfectly with fog’s moods. One hairline slip: "ambient awareness" feels corporate in peak observation beat, but doesn’t obscure closure’s crystalline final image.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong textural specificity ("skeletal hives," "ghost of light") but paraphrase loops in the vision sequence ("fracture—a storm... scattering hives and time alike. But the sunflowers remained") dull momentum near closure’s edge.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("metal groaning beneath his boots"). Minor artifact: "quivering hush" appears 3x with near-identical phrasing (synonym churn), and final "protected vulnerability like mist" uses dead metaphor. Not closure-touching.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "ink that shifted color with her mood" exemplifies high-density texture. Minor deduction for "primordial" lacking specificity in peak beat, but closure remains vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; high density ("The walls shimmered, and for a heartbeat, Elias saw it") advances plot/emotion. Final line recharges "shadowed nexus" motif flawlessly. Minor artifact: "prudently adventurous" reads as template phrasing in peak tension, slightly dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("knelt," "brushed"). Figurative language ("mist clung like a second skin") serves pressure without muddle. Minor density issue: "frayed, dyed a faded crimson" slightly overwrites, but closure image remains razor-sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("fingers brushed," "nail grew warm"). Final line’s "some truths were worth the risk" avoids thematic echo by charging prior stakes through action, not abstraction. Figurative language ("spongey gray") remains precise and pressure-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with clear propulsion, but "pixelated pattern pulsed, almost alive, like a heartbeat trapped in glass" slightly muddles the flake’s function with overwrought simile. Final line ("ready to play...") exemplifies strategic concision.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves high density with clean propulsion, though adjacent sentences occasionally restate ("watching from afar... now the company lay in ruins"). Zero figurative muddle in peak beats; final image’s "talisman" metaphor crystallizes theme without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "light bending through dimensions only dreamers could perceive" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Single deduction for "pen hovered over a blank page" (near-cliché) in high-pressure beat, though offset by strong subsequent action.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("guarded, heart locked behind walls... urge to unbend") slightly dulls immediacy. Otherwise, high density ("vines writhing like serpents") and propulsion; final line's "worth keeping" crystallizes closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops but "scar-link method activated" disrupts voice with clinical diction; high density maintained except final paragraph's "steps light" slightly flattening momentum after transformative climax.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops; "pulsed with inner light" and "fiercely gentle force" avoid purple prose. Minor filter verb ("she wondered if") in para 3 slightly dulls immediacy, but "juice bitter and sweet" delivers high-density sensory payoff in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero closure artifacts, but template cadence ("He’d [verb]") in paragraph 3 and synonym churn ("reverence and frustration") trigger -0.4. Propulsion falters slightly in backstory block, though final image crystallizes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold in "boots clicking against the magnetic lattice" followed by "hum of lodestone leaves," slightly diluting momentum. "Breath held" risks cliché but gains specificity through immediate sensory payoff. Final lines achieve crystalline propulsion with "arbor’s hum" echoing the opening. No artifacts in closure beat preserves resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; every sentence multiplies meaning ("gears whirred softly, a sound like distant waves" establishes setting/character/emotion). Figurative language never muddles: "moonlight dripped in silver puddles" is precise. Final line "waited for the next contradiction" charges closure. Minor artifact: "wintersun serenity" slightly overworked in closing paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels: "boots crunching over shards of obsidian" shows setting while advancing tension. Figurative language sparse but potent ("confessions began to unfurl... as emotions"). Final line avoids sentimentality—"music... hope" recharges "resonant hush" with earned specificity. No register drift during peak stress.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; high density in "bellows—patched with electrical tape" doing triple duty. "Raw, unfiltered edge" slightly drifts toward therapy-speak but redeemed by immediate concrete action (tracing brick grooves). Final "gilding ivy in gold" crystallizes earned solace without sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.6)
    "Cautious exuberance" is therapy-speak label (−0.3 artifact). Filter-verb stack near closure ("Lira smiled beneath her shawl, her heart racing") dulls immediacy. Otherwise clean propulsion, but "faint, ghostly script" slightly overwrites the pivotal discovery beat. No closure-dulling loops.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density but template cadence in "She knew the weight... How they could... This one" triggers -0.4. "Perforated destiny" synonym loops (3 near-identical uses) dull immediacy. Final-third artifacts ("waited. Somewhere, a child laughed") disallow 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; high density ("coaxing them into the emerald’s lattice like threads through a loom"). Minor overwriting: "radiant hush" repetition and "sharp and clear as a bell" cliché barely dent propulsion in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion with purposeful fragments, but paraphrase loop in "withhold... letting it drip" / "did not speak... letting patterns unfold" slightly dulls high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Figurative density muddles peak beats: "skeletal fingers," "pulse left wandering," and "mosaic of battles" collide in opening. Mixed vehicle ("mosaic" visual vs "reverence" auditory) triggers -0.4 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sunlight spilled onto the ice, casting rainbows in frost" charges closure); no figurative muddle even in peak beats like garden transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "squelching on soggy carpet" exemplifies textural specificity, though "meteor hush" slightly strains register in one high-pressure beat without pattern reinforcement.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with varied syntax ("time itself pooled like honey," "breath fogging the glass"), but "stellar doubt" functions as a therapy-speak label artifact in a high-pressure beat, narrowly avoiding closure-touching penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels tension ("monsters’ eyes... glowed faintly, as if awakening" shows rather than tells). Figurative language ("light split into a rainbow that pooled") serves immediacy without muddle. Final line’s "monsters would return" crystallizes theme with surgical precision, avoiding overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with zero closure-beat loops—"expunging ghosts" is slight cliché but redeemed by immediate subversion ("or so she’d always believed"). Final line’s "resurfacing in stories" recharges motifs with crystalline clarity. Minor deduction for one scaffold phrase early, but propulsion remains flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but paraphrase loop in opening ("hummed... vibration that resonated") triggers -0.2; syntactic variety supports propulsion despite one participle simultaneity error ("casting fractured light over her workbench").

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and rhythmic, yet "muscle memory" recurs three times with paraphrase loops ("revised the patterns"/"revised its code"), and weak nominalizations ("a kind of poetry") sap propulsion in critical revision sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero paraphrase loops, but "emotional numbness that had haunted him" risks therapy-speak. "Slicing through pretense like a knife through butter" elevates tension with precise texture in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor scaffold in "let the storm-born silence seep in" (redundant with later motif); otherwise high density with concrete verbs ("knelt, brushing aside reeds") avoiding figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    Near-zero scaffolding; "mournfully eager" borderline label but offset by embodied details ("gloved hands trembling"). Slight overwriting in "conduit for echoes of happiness," yet propulsion remains relentless. Final image ("contented purr") avoids closure muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion except minor paraphrase loop ("mist thickened... mist seeped") costing 0.3; high density maintained through concrete verbs ("claws digging," "sank with a hiss") without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero scaffold: "ash swirling into the sky like a reversed storm" multiplies setting, momentum, and thematic weight in one image; final line recharges "twilight" with "frozen" emotional precision.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; "skeletal hand" metaphor deepens rather than distracts. Peak-beat propulsion falters slightly when "shadows stretched toward the moon like spectral fingers" overwrites tension—dense imagery risks slowing the lunar perigee climax without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in trait repetition ("resiliently positive" x3) and slight metaphor muddle ("vessel were both present and erased") prevent 8.5+. Otherwise, high density with strong verbs ("shuddered," "pulsed") and rhythmic control; closure image ("constellation: the Hourglass") is crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sinew thread... strong enough to anchor a thought") with clear propulsion. Slight redundancy in "realistically imaginary" repetitions prevents 9.0 despite flawless closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with minimal scaffolding, though adjacent "faint, cold glimmer" and "soft glow" create subtle synonym churn; no artifacts in closure beat preserves propulsion toward the resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density in "faint, irregular, like a heartbeat trapped in amber" showcases rhythmic control, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("pulse grew louder, a rhythmic thrum that matched her own racing heart") trigger a −0.2 deduction. Closure beat remains artifact-free, though "reeling hush" risks thematic echo without sufficient concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; high density ("gold fleck’s light dimmed, its purpose fulfilled" compresses action/theme). One paraphrase loop ("water began seeping... pulse raced... had to act fast") deducts 0.2 but avoids closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with propulsion ("frost-laced windows hummed with ghost of starlight"); zero scaffold in peak beats. Minor overwriting in "midnight solace" phrasing slightly dulls closure image's visceral impact without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.2)
    Line-level propulsion flawless in climax: "diamond flared... cracks emitting different tones" avoids figurative muddle. Minor synonym loop ("tracing cracks"/"tracing jagged path") but no scaffold; final line’s image recharges motif with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor synonym loops ("warped—her features elongating, her skin sprouting bark") and one template cadence ("She’d come... Now, it felt"); zero figurative muddle yet slight overwriting in sensory pileup ("crushed lavender and something sharper—petrichor, maybe").

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("resonantly soft" reappears without evolution) and scaffold in backstory paragraph ("orchard had once been..."). Final line’s "lullaby for the world" risks sentimentality but is anchored by "strings still humming," preserving propulsion through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "raw, electric fury that shook the ground" + "sky split open" + "lightning forked" in 3 lines dilutes impact. Template cadence ("He’d always...") dulls immediacy near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion ("Elio paused, listening. The sound wasn’t just noise—it was a map") but opening scaffold ("the kind that clung to old wood...") slightly dulls momentum; no closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero artifacts in peak beats; "pages rustling like whispers" shows textural specificity, though "vibrations in the air" slightly echoes prior "tangible echoes" in adjacent paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor scaffold in "her method was precise" slows propulsion; otherwise, zero loops with high density—"trembled, and the air hummed" compresses action, image, and consequence without muddying the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "starlight seemed to pool in the lock" exemplifies high-density imagery. Slight abstraction in "quiet intensity that made people look away" prevents 9.0, but propulsion remains flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("pry," "waded," "mapped"). "Crisp nostalgia" avoids cliché; metaphors serve logic (constellations as keys). Final line’s cadence shift recharges "broken" motif without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "leaves shift, their shapes rearranging into constellations" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Minor filter verb ("her mind already racing") in high-pressure beat, but closure image ("shadow stretching, thinning") avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.2)
    No loops or scaffold, but fatal artifact: "wonder was not a finite thing" is therapy-speak in closure beat; disallows 9+ globally per Text-Artifact rule despite otherwise pristine propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops with masterful propulsion ("Each knot loosened, a whisper escaping"), but "chorus of ghosts pleading to be heard" edges toward overwriting in a peak beat, slightly muddling the otherwise crystalline closure imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "parchment creaking under his touch" exemplifies textural specificity; zero loops or scaffold. Minor deduction for "methodically curious" label (telling), but redeemed by immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("time seemed to pool in the silence") with propulsion; single filter-verb stack ("her hands trembled as she rewound") slightly dulls immediacy but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong textural specificity but paraphrase loop in "mist curled... driftingly alert" then "mist grew thicker, driftingly alert" dulls immediacy. Elevated diction ("driftingly alert") clashes with Elias' lexicon in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density (“gears grinding like a tired heart” conveys sound, motion, metaphor); final line (“a flame flickered. She’d find it”) crystallizes closure without figurative muddle or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; "patina glowing like old coins" shows texture without overwriting. Sentence variety accelerates during gusts ("She gripped the telescope"), breathes at dawn. Minor elevation in "residual energy" metaphor avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "fractally precise" recurs with evolving purpose, culminating in "spirals emerging as if the tree itself had breathed them"; rhythmic propulsion peaks in the painting sequence without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose avoids major loops but has minor scaffolding ("Her curiosity had always been her compass" slightly tells what showing demonstrates). Figurative language stays purposeful ("starlings screamed as if urging her on"), though "handwriting slanting like a storm front" edges toward cliché. Closure beat ("She’d charted... not just a place, but a truth") remains clear and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or artifacts, but "weight of that legacy" in high-pressure beat risks scaffold tell. Final line ("time, like memory, could always be mended") skirts thematic echo through earned image resonance, avoiding outright moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "flickering like a candle flame" is borderline cliché but redeemed by context. Final line’s chime delivers crystalline closure. Propulsion via active verbs ("mobilize," "chanted") without figurative muddle. Paragraph cuts heighten tension.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "a reminder that even time could rust" uses slight filter verb; high density maintained through climax with no figurative muddle ("golden light" concrete, not purple).

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in the blueprint backstory ("assembled fragments... coalesced in his mind") slightly stalls momentum. Otherwise, high density prevails—e.g., "shadows slicing through twilight" fuses setting and threat—but the reflection’s abstract phrasing risks diluting peak-beat clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; high density ("froth where two currents collided" conveys setting/emotion). Final line cadence perfect: "alive. And that, she thought, was enough." Minor overwriting in "symphonically minded" repetition (para 2 & 5) prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with high density ("parole of unwritten narratives"); only "mind racing" slips into generality, redeemed by subsequent concrete action ("residue swirled like stardust").

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; "salt and iron, sting of tears" does triple duty. Final line recharges "sand" motif without stating moral. Avoids overwriting: "taste of memory fading" not "lingering essence." Minor flaw: "emotionally contagious nature" slightly abstract but redeemed by immediate embodiment ("risked becoming vessels").

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought ("breath held in suspense" near climax triggers density penalty). No loops or scaffold, yet "polished brass, aligned the weight" uses weak nominalizations. Final line’s reprise ("arc a testament") charges closure without muddle, avoiding final-third artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; high density where "shards glinting like shattered constellations" avoids cliché through specificity. "Liquid mercury" to "liquid light" maintains coherent physical logic. Peak-beat compression ("Kael gritted his teeth...") heightens without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "moss-slick stone," "damp earth" demonstrate textural specificity; inversion sequence uses precise verbs without figurative muddle despite high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.9)
    Adjacent synonym loops ("fissures," "stress cracks," "fracture") and template cadence in strumming sequences ("She strummed... She strummed..."). Final paragraph's paraphrase loop ("never stopped sculpting... moved from tree to tree") dulls closure image. Near-miss for 8.0 band.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops; "stardust coalescing into translucent mage" shows crystalline propulsion. "Twilight bled violet" risks purple prose but earns density through nexus hum "making teeth ache." Final line’s "quiet correlation" avoids overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-zero loops; "air hummed with the static of unspoken things" edges toward abstraction but avoids muddle; final line’s simplicity ("learned to listen") delivers propulsion without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lean yet textured, with scaffold ("reminder of the undercurrent...") only in low-pressure beats. Final line integrates "wildflower hush" perfectly, but "doodled on the wrapping paper of her heart" risks sentimentality—saved by earned context.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym churn in "thrashing upward/roots exposed/fruit tumbling" creates rhythmic drag, and "whirling silence" repetition weakens density without pattern payoff in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong rhythm and specificity ("salt-stained gravel"), but "rapidly adapting mind raced" tells rather than shows. Minor synonym churn ("labyrinth," "puzzle box") in early beats slightly dulls propulsion without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops; every line multiplies density ("frost spiraled like ghostly breath" establishes setting, voice, and pressure). Final line’s "oscillating between repose and revelation" recharges motifs without muddle. Figurative language remains coherent through the amber sheet’s evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "pierced the canyon hush like a needle through silk" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line ("quiet hum in his chest") achieves closure with crystalline clarity. Only hairline slip: "tapestry of grief" slightly familiar, but redeemed by context.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold loops; "burnt sapphire and iron filings" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor deduction for "wildfires" metaphor bordering on abstraction during high-pressure empathy merge.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops. "Roots erupted, thin and silver, weaving through the cracks" does triple duty (action, setting, metaphor). Final line’s crystalline simplicity avoids overwriting while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful rhythm shifts ("frost shattered... light flared"), yet "truthful lies" triggers diagnostic label penalty; minor scaffold in "tracing... tracing" slightly dulls closure’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion ("sunlight dripped like liquid gold" → "loom’s rhythmic creak"), but minor scaffold in "wistful hope that her loom’s threads could stitch the world back together" slightly dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; sentences vary rhythm purposefully ("damp earth and forgotten dreams" → "He didn’t flinch"). One near-miss: "azure glow" risks purple prose but earns payoff via silk’s evolving role in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("dust motes swirled... catching faint hues—a mosaic only he could see" does triple duty). Final line’s "cyclically spontaneous" reprises opening with reweighted meaning. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("pale blue, smoothed by years of tumbling in the surf"). Final line’s "song a quiet hymn" achieves textural payoff without overwriting. Slight abstraction in "flicker of curiosity" compensated by kinetic follow-up ("kneeling, he selected three smooth stones").

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "fractured light" and "oily shadow" perform dual atmospheric/character work. Final propulsion ("dawn was coming, and she was ready") avoids overwriting while charging closure. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.1)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("storm intensified"/"storm raged") and slight tell ("healing property at work") mar otherwise crystalline propulsion, though closure remains unscathed.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "mica windows burned like tiny suns" crystallizes closure with high density. Figurative language serves pressure without muddle: fruit "igniting" as hope returns, no artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "warped reflection" metaphor avoids muddle, but "back against the shelf, the letters cradled to her chest" slightly overwrites physicality, dulling closure’s tactile immediacy by 0.2.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "crusty and golden" bread description does triple duty (sensory, symbolic, causal). Final line "had finally learned to see it" recharges opening motif with crystalline clarity. No figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the bread encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops; "quartz hush settling" shows textural specificity. Near-flawless propulsion until "frustration gnawed at her" (slightly generic) in peak stress, but redeemed by immediate concrete action (fist-slam).

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.3)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but "patrons scattering like roaches" simile verges on cliché, slightly dulling the closure image. No loops or scaffold—every sentence advances momentum, though "comforting unease" risks abstraction without the fob's concrete damage.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels story. "Needle spun toward people—specific people" exemplifies high-density phrasing. Final image ("aurora dimmed... world held its breath") crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with propulsion ("jagged teeth seemed to pulse") but minor scaffold in para 3 ("traded passion... soul starved"). Near-duplicate "frozen mid-spin"/"jagged teeth" triggers −0.2; no closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely clean with vivid specificity, but early "quill wilts near dishonesty" is told rather than shown, and minor filter verbs ("she felt") dilute immediacy in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence in the final line—"like the ringing of a bell, like the glisten of ice, like the whisper"—triggers -0.5 for three identical stems in a high-pressure beat, disallowing 9+ globally. Otherwise, lyrical density serves momentum until this artifact dulls closure.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed chain" and "yellowed letters" carry layered meaning. Final line crystallizes theme without abstraction: "solved the mystery, not by force, but by listening" avoids overwriting while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold loops and vivid propulsion, but "water dripped... pooling" creates a minor simultaneity error; no figurative muddle, though "threads spun from the same silk" slightly over-ornaments a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "brittle white fragments" and "swirling vortex" exemplify textural specificity; sentence rhythms accelerate during gravity flares without muddying closure. Final line’s cadence shift ("steady, unwavering") perfects propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "distorting the fireflies’ light into fractured constellations" does triple duty (image, metaphor, stakes). Minor register drift in "terrestrially cosmic" avoids penalty as voice-motivated lexicon, with zero paraphrase loops even in high-pressure beats like the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("patience was the currency of their trade" / "patiently nimble") dulls one beat; otherwise high density with strategic telling ("dismissed as imagination. Now, he wondered") and visceral propulsion ("dust rained," "teeth ache") in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with zero loops, but "lock[ing] her heart" metaphor slightly clichéd in opening. Final paragraph's "ordinary and unyielding" avoids overwriting while "ghostly resolve" earns its lyricism through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless propulsion; minor register drift in "tasting of iron and regret" borders on therapy-speak but avoids full penalty due to contextual integration within peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold in ascent sequence ("Kael paused... Kael continued...") dulls propulsion. "Frayed"/"torn hole" metaphor cluster slightly muddles physical logic. Final paragraph’s "weaving through the nexus" overwrites the earned simplicity of "canyon sing back." No closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("salvaged something pure—not gold or silver, but... threads") with consistent metaphor logic. Final line’s "windows open" recharges motif without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence advances atmosphere or insight. "Bioluminescent trails weaving through the reeds like liquid silver" exemplifies purposeful density—no figurative muddle even in high-pressure beats like the firefly-code discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph 2: "defied logic—thriving in soil... sterilized by fallout" restated as "locals whispered the land was haunted." Otherwise, clean propulsion; "branches unfurling like sighs" avoids cliché while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density falters in climax: "variant allegiance" and "lyrically prophetic" feel abstract amid sensory peaks. Avoids scaffold loops but overwrites conceptual stakes ("shadows weren’t omens... but blueprints") where embodied action needed.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density with clear propulsion: "poured the sound into the music box’s rusted keyhole" does triple duty. Minor scaffold in "He’d spent weeks..." but strategic telling; no loops or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters in the climax with three sequential "he [verb]" constructions ("The ghost lunged... Elias activated... The wraith recoiled"), creating template cadence that dulls immediacy. Otherwise, propulsion and specificity excel, especially in sensory details like "sound slicing through his skull."

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("fractal patterns onto the viaduct’s surface" fuses setting/action). Minor overwriting risk in "shadowed sentinel" metaphor, but viaduct's "heartbeat" vibration stays grounded in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops in climax; final paragraph’s short sentences ("But not anymore.") create propulsion. "Watchfully calm" repetition risks cadence monotony early, but high-density phrasing ("beacon in darkness," "chains binding her") avoids overwriting. Figurative language serves pressure, not decoration.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "the air hummed with a vibrant hush" achieve high density. Minor register drift ("the phrase had come to him unbidden" slightly over-explains interiority) prevents 9.0, but rhythm accelerates perfectly with the rain’s "soft and insistent" fall.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "acid sea below roared, as if annoyed" exemplifies high-density propulsion; figurative language sparse but potent ("irreverent awe blooming"), never muddling climax.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.6)
    No loops or scaffold, but "brightly attentive" repeats verbatim in high-pressure beats, creating subtle synonym churn that dulls immediacy during the climax sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with propulsion ("ice groaned beneath lighthouse’s foundation"), but "weighted breath before reply" creates abstract loop. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, though minor scaffold in reflection ("years too close to aurora’s glow").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose excels in textural specificity ("ice-encrusted boats," "groaning hull") but "fold in patience" explanation reads as scaffold in high-pressure beat, dulling immediacy. No loops or metaphors muddle closure; final line’s "flicker" crystallizes meaning with precise diction.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; “pattering against the leaves” demonstrates high density with propulsion. Figurative language (“bruised with promise of rain”) serves atmosphere without muddling causality, even in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero syntactic loops or scaffold; "veil of woven silk" exemplifies textural specificity. Minor register drift in "conjurer clearings" (abstract for POV) and "kinetic parapet" (technical term) slightly dull immediacy in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold/loops; "frayed photographs," "cool metal" exemplify textural specificity. Near-synonym churn in "resilience/testament" paragraph barely avoids penalty. Final line’s "began to shoot" lacks propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with lines like "time moved differently—a suspended hush." However, "weathered innocence" is a stock phrase that dulls specificity in peak beats, preventing 9+ despite otherwise crystalline prose.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "boots crunching on gravel that had once been part of someone’s demolished life" does triple duty (sound, texture, backstory). Final line’s rhythm crystallizes theme without muddle. One slight labored phrase ("pre cognitively forgetful") barely registers in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density ("copper wire, his mind racing" advances plot/character/atmosphere) with clean propulsion. "Spinning like a dervish" slightly loops with later "blur," but no figurative muddle in peak beats; final image ("luminous ache," wind tug) crystal-clear and unadorned.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "pulsing stillness" reprises meaningfully in climax/final line. Figurative language sparse and earned ("clutching hand like anchor"). "Scent of hope" risks overwriting but doesn't dull closure. Propulsion flawless—every line advances atmosphere or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high density ("spoons bent reality—a bizarre event where ordinary cutlery had warped the fabric of space"), but scaffold phrases like "her eyes bloodshot but her mind sharp" followed by "hands steady despite the rush" create minor redundancy. Final image ("pooling into a single point... gateway to a realm where time flowed backward") crystallizes closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops; every line propels story: “jagged edge cut her thumb” shows trauma, “fountain’s water began to flow again” crystallizes closure. Figurative language sparse but potent (“mistakes are constellations”); final image avoids muddle while charging theme. No artifacts in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; "clinked softly as she sifted" shows action. Sentence propulsion peaks in closure: "The pearl drifted upward, dissolving into the sky." Minor figurative muddle in "zephyr bloom" prevents 9.5, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; every line propels: "snow fell, but the garden held its heat" compresses setting/emotion/closure. Figurative language sparse but potent ("honeyed hush... thick as syrup"). No overwriting—pendant’s "resin’s still there. Obsidian, too. Now life growing" charges climax without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose soars with "kelp in a storm" and "pages rustling like wings," yet "child’s laughter, lover’s sigh" risks sensory checklist. Final image avoids figurative muddle, but density slightly obscures cost legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("golden threads erupted... weaving tales of ancient rituals" advances plot, theme, and atmosphere). Rhythm varies perfectly—lyrical in setup, staccato at climax ("The tendril collapsed, spent")—with no figurative muddle. "Half-remembered, half-invented" is the sole hairline slip, slightly telling.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    "He began by arranging... The branches came next... Finally..." creates template cadence in critical beat. Zero figurative muddle in peak moments, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("dead trees creaked but did not break") trigger minor deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "quartz veins began to glow, their light pulsing" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Slight scaffold in "he worked methodically... tools laid out." Mixed metaphor ("earth healing silent wound") costs 0.2 without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or tension ("mist of silver dust," "fractals shifted... restless spirits"). Final line’s "burdens were safe, for now" delivers closure without figurative muddle, though "sickly green" slightly strains specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "silver threads that blurred the city’s skyline" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Rhythm accelerates during carving ("resisted... yielded... split") without figurative muddle, culminating in flawless final image propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or artifacts; propulsion through concrete verbs ("sifting," "pulsed"). Minor density dip: "Regret coiled... hot and familiar" edges toward cliché despite specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "sextant’s celestial patterns" resonate with hum; "bruised twilight sky" avoids cliché through concrete texture in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops with high density ("moss-patched flagstones" conveys texture and constraint), but "thrummed with memory of sound—the ghost of wind chimes" borders on overwriting; final image pristine with no closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    Filter-verb stacks in climax ("he felt," "he understood") dull immediacy despite vivid imagery. Blueprint discovery uses clinical language ("breath caught") where concrete detail needed; minor scaffold in warehouse description slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; "spirals pulsed faintly, as if remembering lightning" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor repetition of "infinitely patient" (hands/roots) is thematic reinforcement, not scaffold. Final line crystallizes momentum without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats; "thread hummed... low resonant vibration" propels via sensory density. "Lonesome splendor" repeats 4x with earned variation (description → embodied ache → purpose). Minor cadence loop in "after last ship sailed" refrain (-0.1), but final line ("walked into fading light") avoids overwriting. Filter verbs minimal and voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zero loops in closure, but "tears streaming down his cheeks" is bodily cliché; overwriting in high-pressure beat ("keening sound... pierced the very stone") risks figurative muddle, capping Q7 per artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "jingled like a warning" is minor mixed metaphor. Final "unyielding spark" slightly overwrites but doesn’t dull closure. Zero loops or scaffold in critical beats.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but "bruised sky"/"ashen residue" cluster risks overwriting; final third clean, yet "felt or conceptual cost" phrasing echoes rubric language, dulling closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density throughout: "relic forged from dying star, teeth approximating infinity" conveys character, setting, theme. No figurative muddle—metaphors coherent (fire as thief/language). Final line "gentler flame" crystallizes theme without cliché. Minor register drift in "approximating infinity" costs 0.1 but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("damp earth and forgotten roses" conveys setting/theme/emotion). Propulsion through strong verbs ("rattled," "swirled," "spill") without figurative muddle. Final line crystallizes theme with textural specificity ("flight lingered in his bones")—no sentimentality or template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero loops/scaffold until climax where "searing reverie" functions as diagnostic label-speak; artifact in final third disallows 9+ despite otherwise crystalline propulsion and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    No loops or scaffold; high density ("frayed threads whisper uncharted echoes") but "velveteen gloom" risks overwriting in opening. Final line avoids cliché through context, yet minor figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with propulsion ("quill nib scraped the parchment" advances action), but minor scaffold in star-cross-referencing sequence and "promise, or a warning" weakens metaphor. Closure image remains sharp despite isolated cadence hiccups.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "frayed edges of forgotten symphonies" exemplifies high-density prose. Minor overwriting in "thistled calm" slightly dulls immediacy, and "dust itself would stir and listen" edges toward personification muddle, but rhythm varies purposefully to match signal intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose soars with textural specificity ("fingertips leaving faint smudges in the ash") but minor overwriting in the opening ("soft, expectant hush that lingers like the final note of a violin") slightly dulls propulsion. Zero loops in closure beat; ash/stardust metaphor recharges meaning without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("A knock shattered the air" vs. lyrical density). Minor abstraction in "language of the soul" is redeemed by concrete action, but high-pressure beats avoid figurative muddle—closure image ("rosette spun") crystallizes without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("her gentle rebellion against a world that had forgotten beauty" advances character/theme/setting). Final line recharges the opening graffiti without muddle. Sentence rhythm varies naturally—short bursts during cuts ("She pruned again"), flowing during memory sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops with strong propulsion, but "syrupy, as if the world were dipped in honey" borders on figurative muddle in closure beat, narrowly avoiding −0.3 deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "streetlights daydreamed in their amber haze" achieves triple duty (atmosphere, time, tone). Propulsion accelerates during the ritual ("air seemed to thicken... glow emanated"). Slight register drift in "sanctification" is voice-motivated by her theory. Final line crystallizes theme with surgical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Liquid starlight" overwrites the high-pressure drinking beat, and "threaded fingers" implies simultaneity for sequential actions; minor but dulls closure’s propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "balancedly daring" is thesaurus-churn artifact in high-pressure beat; disallows 9+ globally though closure remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; every sentence propels ("A clang echoed... Lila sat up"). Final line crystallizes motif without muddle. Figurative language precise ("blisters tipped with silver like frost") in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero closure-dulling artifacts; "thaw had begun" / "spring’s trickle" creates minor paraphrase loop but "dough’s warmth seeped into her hands" delivers high-density propulsion with no figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops; "latency radiance trapped beneath its surface" compresses backstory into active image. Final line "clocks hung... ticking backward" delivers closure with crystalline specificity—no figurative muddle despite high density in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor density slip ("repulsive allure" label) in high-pressure beat, but zero loops/scaffold; propulsion remains clean with vivid specificity ("sticky with age, ink faded to ghostly blue") until closure.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with "kelp ropes lashed" and "resonance patterns etched," but "like a hive" simile feels stock; paraphrase loop in "layering percussion from the mallet’s taps, the creak of driftwood, and the whisper of kelp ropes" dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("air tasted of salt and iron") with clear propulsion, though "cold sweat broke out" in the tunnel scene edges into stock phrasing without sufficient textural novelty for peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "crumbling pamphlet" and "faint lines" multitask. Figurative language ("brickwork softened into greenish folds") serves atmosphere without muddling peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "arches cradling murky water where sunlight once danced" exemplifies high-density propulsion; only minor register drift in "stoically sensitive gaze" saved by context, no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "dappled resolve" avoids cliché. Final line recharges motif with precision. Only microscopic flaw: "breath steady" borders generic but redeemed by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "shards of light that spiraled into the sky" does triple duty (action/atmosphere/theme). Figurative language precise ("laughter, brittle as winter ice"). Final line's "dull and pitted" recharges opening gem imagery with propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion flawless. Sentences vary rhythm ("Alarms blared. 'Circuit breakers overheating.'") while maintaining density. Figurative language is sparse and purposeful ("laughter like shattered glass"), avoiding muddle even in peak beats like the node's dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loop in mid-beat ("drone beeped... sensors confirmed") causes slight momentum drag. Otherwise, high-density prose ("fractal shadows," "stones vibrating as if waking") avoids figurative muddle while advancing multiple elements per line.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero prose artifacts: high density ("mist clung like a second skin" does triple duty) with no figurative muddle. Sentence rhythm accelerates during the exchange ("No words were spoken. None were needed.") then breathes in the closure, avoiding template cadence or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in peak beats ("Each scratch... a choice she’d second-guessed"). Figurative language precise ("waves slapping hull like metronome") without muddle. Final line crystallizes theme through concrete image ("backlash of regrets... ocean’s way"), avoiding abstraction. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally with scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is largely clean with strong verbs ("waded," "kicked"), but minor scaffold appears ("fragments of guilt that surfaced like ink in water" followed by "gaps... surfaced"); no closure-dulling artifacts, though "jaded wonder, fragile but real" risks cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "thousands of insects crawled beneath it" slightly clichéd but redeemed by concrete progression to feathered fingers. Final line's rhythmic control ("metamorphosis is not an ending, but a rebirth") recharges motif without overwriting. Minor cadence drag in reflection block.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "breath hitched" shows emotion while advancing plot. Final line ("clock’s always ticking, even when broken") crystallizes theme with unparalleled density. Figurative language remains sparse yet potent ("roots coiled like hourglasses").

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    Verbatim repetition of "long-dried tears on faded photographs" creates a paraphrase loop (-0.3), and "gravitationally lighter" trait lacks early embodiment. Otherwise, high density ("shadows dissolved into light") and strong verbs propel momentum without muddying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong rhythm with minor scaffold: "His motivation burned like a ember" redundantly echoes later "spark revolution." Template cadence in action beats ("Kieran held... Elara traced...") slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    No loops or scaffold; "liquid green" aurora metaphor sustains coherence through "bruise-purple" shift; high-density propulsion ("hands flew, reordering rocks") in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; "iron ribs groaning like a beast" shows textural specificity without muddle. Final line’s "raw and unfiltered" risks cliché but earns charge through prior scar imagery. Minor deduction for "furiously tranquil" bordering on label.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold; "prismatic shadows" and "dignified chaos" show textural specificity. Final line’s "better questions" avoids overwriting. Only hairline slip: "cryptic patterns" slightly generic before payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with propulsion, but adjacent paraphrase loops ("rebuild himself from fragments"/"how I rebuild") dull immediacy; no closure-impairing artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but two filter-verb stacks ("pressed... fingers leaving," "watched... horizon swallow") in high-pressure beats slightly dull immediacy despite otherwise crystalline propulsion and textural specificity like "frayed like old lace."

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    No loops or scaffold, but "empirically whimsical" appears as inert label twice; lyrical density in the cavern scene ("glass rained down, melted into liquid light") maintains propulsion without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold/loops; high density (“compass’s needle spun lazily, as if caught between currents”). Minor register drift: “Diffuse the tides” risks academic diction but is justified by Yorick’s expertise. Final line (“rhythm of tides—not of water, but of hearts”) avoids sentimentality through concrete reprise.
