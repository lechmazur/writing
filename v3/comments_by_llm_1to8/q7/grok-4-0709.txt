  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the dust accumulation sequences that merge action and meaning. Minor template cadence appears in "Elena + verb" constructions across several paragraphs, and some paraphrase loops occur around the preprocessing concept, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows purposeful rhythm variation and strong imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting ("the night air humming with a drifting resonance that echoed her fractured thoughts"). Several abstract phrases like "drifting resonance" and "steadily adaptive" lack concrete grounding. The final third improves with clearer, more embodied language around the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("No voices echoed, no winds howled") but suffers from overwriting and metaphor density. Mixed metaphors appear ("trapped winter's breath like a silent symphony"), and elevated diction sometimes obscures clarity ("rectified her personal loss"). Template phrasing emerges in emotional sequences ("reds of passion and blues of sorrow"), and several paraphrase loops dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("dim, watery glow," "pressurized silence"). Minor template cadence in middle section ("He'd stared...He'd ignored..."). Strong opening and closing images bracket the piece effectively. Some filter constructions ("felt his inadvertent stubbornness") reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong rhythm ("The bell rested in his lap, cool against his palm") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. "Gently persistent" appears four times, creating a template feel. Paraphrase loops emerge: "anonymous donations through midnight food runs" restates across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. The closing image lands effectively but earlier sections lack the compression this length demands.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.1)
    Overwriting pervades key moments: "glowing reservoir, brimming with love unspoken, untouched since that ancient tragedy" stacks modifiers without advancing pressure. Template phrasing appears in "She began with shallow breaths...but slowly deepened them" and "Tears welled, mirroring Kwan Yin's compassion." The abstract language ("unused love," "foggy lucidity") reduces clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("colors leaching away into sepia ghosts") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract phrasing. Template cadence appears in "He saw...Elias tried...he watched" sequence. Overuse of "quaking/quivering/trembling" variants (7 instances) creates synonym churn. The hyperbolic geometry explanation arrives abruptly without sufficient grounding for non-mathematical readers.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("chains rattling softly, his movements a dance of restrained elegance") but suffers from overwriting in places. Phrases like "tyranny's grasp" and "merciless advance" feel stock. Some sentences strain for effect rather than clarity, particularly the extended metaphors about grace and staggering.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "bioluminescent fish darted among the branches," though some passages lean toward overwriting ("veils of green and violet that sang to him like distant violins"). Minor redundancy in describing the synesthetic gift appears but doesn't compromise clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from repetitive abstract phrases ("luminous disbelief" x3, "illuminated moments" x3) and occasional overwriting. Some metaphors strain ("forest under siege"). Information density is moderate; several sentences could do more work. The template phrase "quietly savvy" feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("reluctant tears," "captured starlight") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("weighty lightness," "gravity of loss danced with fleeting joy") and some filter-verb accumulation. The theatrical narrations provide rhythmic variety, though several passages lean toward tell-mode summation rather than embodied scene.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with mixed metaphors ("twisted like forgotten promises," "scripted fall," "winds of change") that muddle rather than clarify. Template phrases like "firmly adaptive" repeat mechanically, while abstract declarations ("transformative betrayal") replace concrete dramatization. The final paragraph's explicit theme statement and several paraphrase loops ("vulnerability is power" restated multiple times) significantly harm momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She would," "Then," appears frequently). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "summarizing silence"/"summarized a silence" recurs without variation. Information density is moderate; some sentences merely restate rather than advance ("Her motivation culminated here, the map nearly complete").

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though repetitive "amalgamate/amalgamation" appears 7 times, creating mild template cadence. Strong specific imagery: "transparent violin made of ice crystal," "metallic fingers curling around the bow." Minor paraphrase loop: "The program had thrust Eko into those timelines" followed immediately by explanation of the same concept.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("droplets clung to shimmering facets like unspoken regrets") but suffers from repetitive constructions and occasional overwriting. Template phrases like "driven by his motivation" and "the core concept crystallized" create scaffold. The abstract phrasing around the visitor ("ethereal figure still hovering") reduces immediacy in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("hedges twisted like forgotten promises") but suffers from repetitive structures and occasional overwriting. Template cadence appears in "He would stage...First, Elias announced...Thorne arrived...Meanwhile, Elias retreated." The phrase "commemorating small victories elaborately" recurs mechanically. Information density is moderate but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structure and purposeful technical vocabulary. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "subdued awakenings" appears five times with similar phrasing; "mechanically warm" repeats without evolution. The phrase "icy warmth" recurs three times identically. Some passages over-explain rather than trust the dramatization ("proving her theory in a cascade of data").

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, particularly effective in the crescendo sequence. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive constructions ("Elias's motivation," "Elias's breath," "Elias's fingers"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("ethereal pull," "gaps between life and echo"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("instruments floated like drowned dreams").

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from overwriting: "auroral sorrow" appears three times, creating repetitive patterning. Mixed metaphors clash ("vice" of altitude sickness, truth as "bitter herb" then "weight"). Template cadence emerges in "She understood then," "She nodded," "She had come here"—reducing propulsion in critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows strong moments like "beads clicking like rosary prayers he didn't believe in" but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence in peak beats contains figurative language. Template cadence appears in the ghost encounter sequence ("One spectral worker approached... its ethereal hand grasping..."). The final paragraph rushes through resolution without adequate breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("Vines twisted through cracked stone shelves, cradling forgotten tomes") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "regenerative silence" (4 instances) and "drift of untold seasons" (3 instances). Template cadence appears in the observation sequence ("Forests bloomed and withered, cities rose...wars igniting"). Information density is moderate—some passages do single duty. The paraphrase loop between "regenerative silence...mended the fractures" and "regenerative silence worked its magic" triggers -0.4.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.1)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose ("where ancient trees whispered secrets beneath the hush of dreaming roots"), mixed metaphors, and template phrasing ("tears welled in his eyes"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear (the ridge description repeats across paragraphs 1-2). The prose prioritizes ornamental language over momentum, with figurative language appearing in most sentences without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and evocative imagery. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "bronze quiet" is explained redundantly, and phrases like "sensitively perceptive" repeat unnecessarily. The density of figurative language in descriptive passages occasionally slows momentum without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some metaphor clustering in places ("symphony," "orchestrated," "conductor's baton," "new score") but remains coherent. The fortune cookie phrases demonstrate effective compression and enigmatic precision.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose momentum builds through varied paragraph lengths and syntactic patterns matching the loop structure. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision: "encroaching shadow," "malevolent force," "insidious grip" lack specificity. The line "decorating with silence, arranging pauses like ornaments" effectively merges action with concept, but overwriting appears in "slithered through the veils."

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("The shell was no mere trinket; it was his key") but suffers from occasional overwriting in phrases like "unheard symphonies of futures unwritten" and some repetitive constructions around "chronologically homesick." The final fortune provides sharp closure, though middle sections contain mild density issues with figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and strong imagery ("gravity's whisper," "crowns of light"). However, abstract constructions proliferate in the timeline sections ("rot beneath," "hollow triumphs," "unresolved maze"), creating distance where specificity would heighten impact. The filter-heavy construction "she generated a timeline" repeats, creating template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("reversed lullabies that sighed like wind through hollow reeds") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias felt," "Elias watched," "Elias welcomed") and some abstract phrasing. The "filament of hush" repetition works thematically but creates mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("preserving the chaos of the skies with unerring precision") but suffers from density issues—multiple abstract phrases cluster without advancing pressure. Several paraphrase loops appear ("meticulous storm recorder"/"preserving...with unerring precision"). The phrase "credibly curious nature" feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("crystal shadows," "genetic whispers") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("wistful lantern broker," "alchemical transformations"). Some template phrasing appears ("Elias wandered," "Elias was," "Elias had avoided"). The final paragraph effectively compresses resolution without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("skies had fractured into prisms of unending light") but suffers from abstraction loops around time's "texture" and "weave" without sufficient concrete embodiment. Template cadence appears in "He began by... Each scrape revealed... But this was mere prelude" progression, and filter constructions like "he knew he must" dull immediacy in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "shipwrecks that encircled the old orchard greenhouse, its glass dome half-submerged like a forgotten bubble in the sea." However, some template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("He recalled...He gathered...He sat...He continued"). Minor synonym churn with "hush/quiet/silence" and some elevated register drift ("ethereal notes," "magnificent simplicity") that doesn't fully integrate.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing the ritual or revealing character. However, figurative language occasionally overwhelms clarity ("a tingling web that connected her to the invisible currents of emotion swirling in the space"). Some paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the transformation concept being restated rather than dramatized in places.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.9)
    Significant repetition issues: "cautious exuberance" appears three times, "silent contributors" four times, "cycles of compassion" becomes a refrain. Template phrasing pervades ("Elias felt," "Elias realized," "Elias decided"). The prose suffers from telling over showing ("Moved, he initiated a deeper conversation") and overwritten metaphors ("like tiny negotiators in the dark"). These artifacts accumulate to dull momentum, particularly in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades with abstract figurative language: "luminescent ache," "glowing void," "beautiful pain of remembering." Template phrasing appears in "Lirah, driven by her bold sympathy" and "Years passed in the crystalline orchard." The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion, with multiple sentences restating isolation or connection without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("giant's breaths manifested as visible waves") but suffers from abstract phrasing around key mechanics ("sculpted time itself, borrowing slivers"). Several passages contain conceptual redundancy (the interrupted cadence explanation repeats), and filter constructions ("Elara knew she must act") reduce immediacy in pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong imagery and rhythm but suffers from occasional overwriting ("ceaseless drip," "gentle invention," "ambiguous loss" in close succession). Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. Template cadence appears briefly ("Elias, a man of..." "His life was one of...") but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=6.2)
    Dense figurative language appears in most sentences ("shadowed library," "hesitant fireflies," "sapphire hush," "ethereal veils"), creating atmosphere but occasionally obscuring clarity. Some metaphors strain ("the city's lights flickered like hesitant fireflies"). The prose achieves momentum through the search sequence and sense memory cascade, though phrases like "kindly methodical" repeat without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery like "raindrops still clung like jewels to the latticework" but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Phrases like "reluctant and unwelcome" and "reluctant and unbidden" create unnecessary loops. The transformation sequence maintains momentum, though abstract phrases like "beauty in yielding" and "testament to metamorphosis embraced" weaken precision.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("silver trails snaking," "fossilized insect trapped eternally"). However, several template constructions appear: "Elias hadn't slept... He was an insomniac painter... His demeanor was wryly earnest" reads like prompted attributes. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("thresh meaning," "kernels of truth," "chaff of trauma" in close succession).

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from repetitive constructions ("She stepped," "She lifted," "She stumbled") and abstract phrasing ("unseen forces," "fluid awareness"). The paraphrase loop around Elara not seeing it coming appears four times with minimal variation. Template cadence emerges in the transformation sequence where multiple sentences begin with "She" or "Her." Information density is uneven—some sentences merely restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose achieves moments of vivid imagery ("ivory harbor, where pale spires of weathered bone rose like forgotten teeth from the sea"). However, several passages slide into summary mode with template phrasing ("Through the night," "By the week's end"), and the middle section contains paraphrase loops where Elara's compilation work is described redundantly. The repetitive "staggered intervals" structure creates some monotony despite thematic justification.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive constructions and overwrought metaphors. "Trembling certainty" and "analytically artistic" become loops. Several sentences strain under decorative weight ("the starlit vault above seemed to pulse with ancient rhythms"). The final paragraph rushes through crucial transformation without scenic detail.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. However, some abstract phrasing weakens immediacy ("tangled thoughts could untangle," "sculpt space for reflection"). The transcription sequence contains minor redundancy between "memories knotted with her guilt" and later "burdensome tangle."

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, particularly during the mutiny sequence. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "dimensionally aware senses tingling with the subtle shifts in reality's fabric" could be half as long. Some metaphors strain ("existence stretched thin across millennia like a threadbare tapestry"), and occasional synonym churn weakens momentum ("hushed thunder"/"subdued roar").

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure, though several instances of overwriting ("chamber of deathly vitality," "buzzing with the hum of refrigeration units and the faint, electric pulse of hidden life"). Some paraphrase loops around the fair trade concept. Template cadence appears in places ("Alex had tested... Now, it would... Father's last con...").

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=6.7)
    The prose achieves strong atmospheric density with vivid imagery like "petals refracting the first light in prismatic whispers." However, several instances of abstract telling ("his true motivation lay deeper," "Theme resists tidy morals") and some overwriting in descriptive passages ("the rough weave of medieval tapestries, the slick sheen of Victorian silk") slow momentum. The ending paragraph contains too much abstract declaration rather than concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("tone of nameless identity," "essence of existence without labels") and repetitive constructions. Multiple instances of telling rather than showing ("This wasn't just debris; it was a relic"). The metaphor of texture appears frequently but remains conceptual rather than sensory. Some effective moments like "histories erased like chalk on a wet board" don't compensate for overall abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and imagery but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Phrases like "fleeting spark," "whisper of closing pages," and "mist on the sea" accumulate without always advancing pressure, creating ornamental weight.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.1)
    Multiple template phrases undermine momentum: "hope flickered," "desperation clawed," "whispers loomed like storm clouds." The story relies on abstract summary ("weeks passed," "night after night") rather than compressed scene work. Information density is low—many sentences restate concepts without adding pressure or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose clarity generally serves the story, though several template constructions appear ("Elena shivered...Elena paced...Elena's breath caught"). Abstract phrasing like "melancholy tugged at her heart" and "hollow ache" weakens specificity. Information density is moderate but could be tighter, particularly in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues include redundant descriptors ("heartfelt artisan," "magnetic calm" repeated), abstract phrasing ("frayed edges of souls"), and template constructions ("With deft hands, he..."). The prose reaches for lyricism but often lands in purple territory, particularly "moths to a flame" and similar worn metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose flows clearly with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops weaken density ("his subtly confident demeanor masking the quiet anxiety" repeats established characterization). The writing is competent but lacks the compression and propulsion needed for excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing plagues the prose: "wild hush" appears 7 times, "infinitely patient" 3 times, "cryptic" 5 times without variation. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("Thorne believed...He chose...He struck...Then, he walked"), and abstract descriptors like "shared balance" substitute for concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of sensory specificity ("soft click that reverberated unnaturally in the water") contrast with abstract passages that accumulate modifiers ("swirling vortex of muted light, tangled like vines in a storm"). Several instances of telling over showing ("newfound resolve," "solitary triumph") and repetitive structure ("gathered hush," "lonesome splendor," "ephemeral") create mild density issues without destroying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures that create momentum. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "copperlight repose" repeats four times, creating a pattern that feels forced; phrases like "whispered their sins to the sea" and "bloodline—his father's lies had summoned real wolves" edge toward purple prose. The abstract phrasing around "sustaining impossibilities" and "threading the labyrinth" occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("she ghosted" appears multiple times) and ornamental metaphors that don't advance pressure ("eyes like shadowed embers"). Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions across visits, though the final transformation lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose maintains poetic consistency but suffers from overwriting in places: "gentle, floral hush that soothed the soul like petals on bruised skin" layers metaphor unnecessarily. Template cadence appears in the sleepwalking sequences ("She wove...they sewed...they stitched"). The piece relies heavily on abstract telling ("haunting optimism," "quiet worship") rather than concrete dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=5.3)
    Prose suffers from template cadence ("She began... She sat... She swore...") and paraphrase loops, particularly around the faith/restoration concept repeated in different phrasings. Overwriting appears in mixed metaphors ("roots snaked between bones, twisting through skulls and femurs like veins of life"). Information density is low with multiple sentences restating similar content about interrupted journeys. The filter-verb stack ("she recalled... wondering... imagining") dulls immediacy in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: "shimmering haze of a futuristic dawn," "nostalgic hum," "forgotten whispers from an analog era" pile figurative language without advancing story. Template phrases like "Elara knew better" and "Memories flooded her" create loops. The dense metaphorical overlay ("guardian of forgotten arts," "bridge across time") obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows strong atmospheric control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("cobalt observatory perched on autumn-kissed cliffs," "echoed silence") and some paraphrase loops occur ("echoed silence" appears three times). The density of figurative language in non-peak moments dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=6.4)
    "Fierce tenderness" repetition (4x) creates template cadence. Several abstract constructions weaken immediacy: "the attribute of the shard awakened," "evidence of carry-through." Strong moments like "tracing patterns in the condensation" show concrete action, but overwriting in phrases like "singing spirits hummed melodies of lost regrets" dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "mist-clad atrium at twilight, where the fading light filtered through vine-draped arches." However, several paraphrase loops appear ("shared anxieties" concept repeated), some template phrasing ("Elena felt," "Elena nodded"), and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and structures, though some ornamental phrases slow key beats ("bittersweet dance between melancholy reflection and the faint, playful spark"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in "She began...She watched" sequence but quickly varies.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("paths were woven from refracted melodies") but occasionally tips into overwriting with stacked modifiers. Some repetitive structures appear ("she awoke," "awakening," "awoke once more") though they serve the nested pattern. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others lean decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows syntactic variety and strategic figurative language, though density occasionally overwhelms clarity ("chaos converged swiftly"). Template cadence appears in action sequences ("Elias held up...," "Elias chuckled...," "Elias snatched..."). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but some metaphors strain ("vines twisted like neural pathways").

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=5.3)
    Overwriting pervades: "pain festered, unyielding" and "centuries of longing weighed heavy" exemplify redundant intensifiers, while "shyly unstoppable" appears three times without variation. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("He sang of...," "They traveled...," "Flowers of verse erupted..."), and abstract metaphors like "photosynthesize pain" lack concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with most lines serving multiple functions. Minor overwriting appears in places ("deserted marvels," "gently systematic grace") and some metaphors strain slightly, but clarity remains intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery ("dim vaults," "bioluminescent fungi," "symphonies of truth"), though some passages lean purple ("cascading truths in harmonic waves"). Notable template repetition in promise construction ("I vow to..." structure) and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during the climax dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though figurative density occasionally impedes clarity ("his resolve was dappled, shadowed by doubts that flickered like sunlight through volcanic ash"). Some template phrasing appears ("weight of his mission pressing upon him"). The discovery sequence maintains strong propulsion through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching ("chaos of his heart," "curling like dried petals"). Template cadence appears in "He believed... He clutched... He affixed." Clarity remains intact but momentum drags through dense metaphorical layers. The final paragraph contains explicit thematic statements that should emerge through image.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=5.4)
    Dense figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff ("whispers across the void," "fractured hush," "featherly determined"). Multiple paraphrase loops restate the threshold concept without advancing pressure. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over momentum, creating beautiful but static passages.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from ornamental phrases like "veils of mystery" and "tapestry weaving wonder." Template cadence appears in "She would... She had..." sequences. Information density is uneven—some sentences purely decorative while others efficiently advance multiple story elements. The synchronized breath moment achieves clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language appearing in most sentences ("frozen rainbows," "starry veins," "tiny vessels of chance"), creating ornamental clutter rather than propulsion. Template phrasing appears in parallel structures ("She knew...," "She clutched...," "She settled...") and paraphrase loops restate concepts ("missing pieces—fragments of journeys lost, emotions unspoken, paths untaken").

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting with dense figurative language that occasionally obscures clarity ("serenade monotony with creativity," "calculated wilderness"). Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("He placed...positioning it just so," "He called out...inviting Mira"). However, sentence variety exists and the opening/closing lines effectively frame the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments ("shadows wove elegant veils," "body a conduit for ocean's rhythms") but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("She was...," "She had...," "She would..."). The moonstone dust description contains unnecessary modifiers ("minuscule fragment," "speck no larger than a grain of sand").

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of clarity and rhythm but suffers from abstraction loops and elevated diction that obscures meaning. "Noctilucent reckonings—those glowing insights that emerged in the night's quiet" exemplifies unnecessary complexity. Template constructions appear ("He approached...He knew...He tossed") and abstract phrases like "clear complexity of his insights" replace concrete imagery. The filter verb "felt" appears repeatedly without adding texture.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades the text with dense figurative language appearing in most sentences ("moonlit ridge," "velvet expanse," "silvered by moonlight," "ethereal light") without clear pattern or payoff. Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("tears fell silently," "eyes wide with fear") and repetitive constructions ("reflecting deeply" appears twice verbatim). The prose achieves atmosphere but sacrifices momentum to ornamental description that doesn't advance plot or deepen character.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstraction loops ("hope's new calculus," "metaphysical height," "emotional atmospheres") and repetitive structure across the three trial balloon sequences. The phrase "serene upheaval" appears four times, creating thematic redundancy. Information density is moderate but padded with conceptual explanations rather than concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose shows strong atmospheric control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several abstract phrases weaken precision: "legacy's burden" appears multiple times without variation, "burdened by the legacy of denial" relies on nominalization, and the final paragraph contains conceptual loops ("chart not just echoes, but redemptions, turning the past's burdens into guides").

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several passages contain ornamental language that doesn't advance story: "turning the stone parapet into a prism that scattered rainbows" could be compressed. Some abstract phrasing ("possibilities lingered like unspoken promises") lacks concrete grounding. The density of figurative language in non-peak moments (-0.5) prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence lengths and clear action sequencing. Information density is reasonable, with most sentences advancing story or atmosphere. However, multiple instances of abstract telling ("weary peace negotiator," "forever war," "flawed beauty") and repetitive structures ("She had come here," "She placed," "She addressed them") create template cadence that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax, but several instances of overwriting harm momentum: "poem interrupted," abstract "fractured grace" repeated without clear meaning, and purple patches like "desolate mirror of the sky." The paraphrase loop around the aurora swift's echo (lines 7-8) and template phrasing around water imagery create drag.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from overwriting in peak beats—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Mixed metaphors appear ("threads of light," "knotted essences," "harp strings") without coherent vehicle. Template cadence emerges in the ritual sequence ("Thread by thread," "Echo by echo"). Information density is moderate; several passages restate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and sophisticated vocabulary, but suffers from abstraction loops ("half-lit epiphanies," "partial revelations glowing dimly") and repetitive conceptual phrasing around ethics and reversal. Several passages restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle reflection sections.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in construction sequences. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("verdant grotto above the clouds" appears three times) and abstract phrases like "esoteric imbalances of reality" that slow momentum without adding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of beauty but suffers from overwriting - "icebound sanctum beneath the ceaseless dance" and similar constructions appear throughout. Several paraphrase loops occur, particularly around the rope's description and Elara's emotional state. Information density could be higher.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"ancient oaks twisted like forgotten promises" establishes setting, tone, and theme simultaneously. Some overwriting appears ("ethereal grit—that blend of dreamy resolve and gritty survival") and occasional register drift, but no loops or scaffolding mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=4.2)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with purple prose ("dusky harmony," "harmonious limbo," "frugal wisdom") and forced integration of required elements. Template cadence appears in repetitive "Elias [verb]" constructions. Multiple paraphrase loops occur, such as "encrypted devotion" restated as "coded prayer" and "disguised astronomical calculations." The modifier density in phrases like "ghostly figures emerged from the rift, Babylonian sages in spectral robes" slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is moderate—most lines advance story or atmosphere. However, several instances of telling over showing ("scheming pacifist," "eyes burning with resentment") and some overwrought figurative language ("poisoning his every step," "replaying in his veins like a toxin") create mild opacity. The sanctuary description contains some scaffolding that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The inhale/exhale structure creates effective propulsion through the ritual sequence, and sensory details like "frost-kissed stump" and "prismatic gleams" serve the atmosphere. However, abstract phrases like "boundaries dissolved completely" and "ethereal realm" lack specificity, and some sentences rely on telling ("wild and elusive") rather than embodied showing. The prose occasionally reaches for ornamental effects ("veil of frozen diamonds") that slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.3)
    Strong moments like "seeds carried by birds through breached walls" show purposeful imagery, but the prose suffers from overwriting in places—"twin orbs of polished quartz that gleamed with an inner light" could simply be "quartz eyes gleaming." Multiple template constructions appear ("He had come here after," "He had packed it," "He hadn't remembered") creating repetitive rhythm. The final exchange risks sentiment with its too-neat wisdom packaging.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("petals drifted like snow in zero gravity") but suffers from occasional density that obscures momentum. Some philosophical passages loop conceptually ("nonlinear fashion that looped through time's fabric"). The "simply complicated" paradox works well when applied to concrete objects but becomes muddy in abstract passages.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of lyrical precision ("shelves twisted like veins through stone") but suffers from abstract inflation in key beats ("the music of possibilities itself"). Several template constructions appear ("Elara tilted her head," "Thorne wept") and the resolution paragraph contains conceptual redundancy. The "unheard symphony" metaphor, while thematically relevant, appears too frequently without evolving its vehicle.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm changes. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, several instances of elevated diction ("perpetual twilight," "spectral vessel," "blissfully aberrant") create mild register drift, and there's occasional redundancy in describing the fog's binding effect.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with most sentences advancing multiple elements simultaneously. However, abstract phrases like "chaos of incomplete histories" and "fabric of reality" lack concrete specificity. Template cadence appears in the climactic sequence ("She pressed... watching as... The action was deliberate") creating mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("cracks spidering out like veins of frozen lightning") but suffers from abstract declarations and explanatory scaffolding ("This examination wasn't mere observation; it was a ritual"). Template cadence appears in multiple sequences ("She believed...Venturing deeper...Reaching the heart..."). The paraphrase loop between "hammered repose" appearing four times with similar phrasing dulls impact, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose has rhythm and varies sentence structure effectively. Information density is high - most sentences advance plot and atmosphere simultaneously. Some figurative language feels forced ("thistle-blown hope" appears multiple times). Minor template patterns in vision sequences ("she saw..."). The writing is clean but occasionally purple, particularly in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("lightning veined the sky like fractured memories") but suffers from repetitive structures and abstract declarations. Phrases like "her motivation burned clear" and "preemptively nostalgic" appear multiple times without variation. The final paragraph relies on telling ("through her work, identities emerged") rather than showing the transformation. Some sentences do multiple jobs effectively, but others merely restate ("The observatory...held her in its embrace").

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the chanting refrains. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. Deductions for metaphor density in places ("pulled at him like an unseen gravity"), some filter-verb clustering ("he realized," "he felt"), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("stars pierced the open ceiling") but suffers from redundant phrasing—"warmly observant" appears twice, "transition periods" repeats, and abstract scaffolding accumulates ("texture of time" variations). The paraphrase loop around foresight ("began to foresee fragments"/"foresaw challenges") dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages of the trellis realm. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwrought metaphors ("invisible vines," "honeyed quiet") and some abstract phrasing that reduces immediacy ("resilient openness").

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery, but several redundancies weaken momentum: "ephemeral dock to another" after establishing transit, "Mira complained, her words echoing" (double-tagged dialogue), "watched her shoulders relax" following established calm. The phrase "fluidly logical realm where winds followed predictable currents" feels forced to incorporate the required attribute.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.7)
    Several instances of ornamental overwriting weaken momentum: "nostalgic fireflies from a bygone era," "poignant blend that stirred Elara's soul." Template phrasing appears ("With a deep breath," "heart pounding"). The prose achieves clarity but relies on abstract descriptors ("renewed harmony," "fractured future") that dilute specificity. Information density is moderate—many sentences do single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from abstract repetition ("loaded emptiness" appears 3 times, "encroach/encroaching" 7 times). Some sentences rely on telling over showing ("She had burned that bridge carefully, excising the toxic bond with surgical care"). Information density is moderate - several passages could be compressed without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in places ("ethereal light, weaving seams of wonder through the darkness") and repetitive structure ("She typed... The responses flooded... Elara had heard..."). The "translate pressure into diamonds" phrase appears three times without variation. However, key moments maintain clarity and the closing image lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and atmospheric control, particularly in "golden shadows lengthened as evening deepened." However, abstract phrases like "bridge of intuition" appear repeatedly without concrete grounding, and some sentences suffer from overwriting: "sanctuary of golden shadows, where light and dark danced in harmonious secrecy." The template structure of "He [verb], [participial phrase]" appears too frequently.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("vines twisted like veins of liquid gold") but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"shivering bliss" appears four times, "murmured allegiance" three times. Template constructions proliferate in the middle section ("He pondered," "He realized," "Elandor began," "Elandor's heart raced") creating predictable cadence that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between description and discovery. Information density is generally strong. However, several phrases edge toward overwriting ("coaxing a shy bloom from parched soil") and some conceptual redundancy appears ("fractured"/"fracture" repetition, multiple uses of "kindness").

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("She was...", "It was...", "Elara's...") and some overwrought metaphors ("moved like a whisper," "turning scraps into weapons"). Several passages restate concepts without added pressure ("fostering a collective shrug that let oppression thrive unchecked" following "tyranny of apathy"). The writing achieves momentum in action sequences but loses precision in thematic passages with abstract descriptors like "unrevised histories" appearing multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variety and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. However, template cadence appears in repeated "He [verb]" constructions (lines 9, 12, 23). Some metaphorical density in high-pressure beats ("invisible serpents," "tears on the atrium's prisms") without clear payoff triggers minor overwriting penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages. However, abstract descriptors weaken precision ("ethereal beings," "cryptic patterns," "ethereal glow" appears twice). The template structure "She started with... Next came..." could vary more. Filter verb in "Elara believed that" dulls immediacy at a key motivational beat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during action sequences. Information density is generally good, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("meticulous diagrams, convinced that precision would conquer chaos"). Notable template phrasing appears ("It started with...then another") and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("he felt an attribute awaken"). The "befriend uncertainty" phrase repeats without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments—"rivulets of water still traced silvery paths down the soot-streaked walls"—with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, abstract phrases accumulate ("equilibrium reigned," "conceptual shards," "resonating at frequencies") without concrete anchoring. The phrase "factually mystical" repeats awkwardly, and some passages like "transforming ruin into something more profound" read as scaffold rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.4)
    Information density varies - strong passages like "the harp was deliberately flawed, its frame warped by time, producing melodies that twisted like vines" do multiple jobs efficiently. However, several descriptive runs lack propulsion ("Elara wandered as the lost soul collector" followed by backstory). Some metaphor stacking ("luminous ache" appears four times) creates mild redundancy without deepening meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of precision ("phantom pressure built in her temples") but suffers from overwriting in places ("ethereal glows that only her enhanced eyes could perceive"). Template phrases appear ("memories were fractured," "sweat beaded on her skin"), and the mathematical formula arrives as assertion rather than earned revelation. Some metaphors strain coherence (penance as both light and "warm calculus").

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive abstract phrasing: "overlooked histories" appears 5 times, "hidden details" 4 times, creating synonym churn. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("She had... She navigated... She placed..."). Information density is moderate but several passages restate rather than advance, particularly around the "anchors of intuition" concept.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates solid clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts (short during ghost manifestation, longer during discovery). However, several instances of overwriting appear: "ethereal heaviness that pressed without mass, like regrets carried on a breeze" strains the metaphor, and "fragile threads of forgotten lives" in the final line tends toward abstraction. Some filter verbs ("Elias felt," "he noticed") dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("glass fruits ripened with knowledge"), and syntactic variety supports the lyric mode. However, abstract phrasing clusters in places ("destabilizing potential," "latent energy," "amplifying their destabilizing potential") and some conceptual redundancy appears in the rupture sequence where similar effects repeat.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose demonstrates ambition with phrases like "burnished sorrow" creating textural coherence. However, abstract constructions proliferate ("cataclysmic shift when temporal currents materialized"), and several passages read as conceptual summary rather than embodied scene. The line "reimagined the civilization as one of quiet uprisings drowned in opulence" exemplifies the tendency toward abstraction over concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.2)
    Significant overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "shadows hissed," "inky tendrils seeping through cracks," "prismatic light across the chamber" cluster without advancing distinct pressure. Template cadence appears in "Elias began...," "Elias knew...," "Elias envisioned...," "Elias stepped back..." Filter-verb stacks dull immediacy ("Elias recalled," "ensuring his heart held"). The prose prioritizes ornamental description over momentum, with mixed metaphors (light as both liquid "trickling" and solid being "tethered").

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("profound silence," "enigmatic energies"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for repetitive "resonant hush" (4x) and some elevated diction that borders on purple in the lagoon sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm modulation during the storm sequence. However, several template patterns emerge: "Elara [verb]" constructions appear frequently, and abstract phrases like "layered bonds, forged in desperation" and "scaffold the complexity" create occasional opacity. The "turbine-hum reverie" repetition feels forced rather than pattern-taught.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract telling weaken immediacy ("quietly driven" appears multiple times as a label). Some paraphrase loops exist ("seeking the same understanding" restates established information). The phrase "reckon with" appears four times, creating repetitive scaffolding that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("dunes rose like silent sentinels") but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Elias's motivation burned fiercely," "the reverie seared his senses," "searing reverie," "searing dreamscape"). Template cadence appears in the debris-message sequence. Information density varies, with some passages doing multiple jobs while others merely describe.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose demonstrates strong moments like "lanterns dangled like forgotten dreams" but suffers from repetitive constructions ("Wish after wish," "Bit by bit") and occasional overwriting. Several passages contain paraphrase loops, particularly in the working memory sequence where multiple sentences restate the reconstruction concept. The narrative maintains momentum but could achieve greater concision.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "soft and insidious," "fervent spikes, betrayal's hollow echoes," and repetitive use of "velvet" imagery. The template phrase "He + verb" appears too frequently in the immersion sequence, creating mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong sensory detail. Deductions for repetitive oxymoronic constructions ("furiously tranquil" appears twice, "wild serenity" three times) and some abstract phrasing that dulls momentum ("the texture of borrowed time, that elusive sensation"). The paraphrase in "a swirling maelstrom of light"/"swirling lights" creates minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves clarity but suffers from occasional overwriting—"colossal relic from the monastery's pious past" and similar elevated phrases appear frequently. Template cadence emerges in "He moved...he began...he switched," and several paraphrase loops dilute momentum ("quiet life as a humble storm siren tester" followed by elaboration).

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with elevated diction ("ethereal dust left by celestial wanderers," "luminosities," "vivid patterns") appearing in most sentences without clear pattern or payoff. Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "seeking solace in obscurity"/"hiding"/"path to inner power" restates the same uncertainty. The phrase "flourishing stillness" appears four times without evolving meaning, creating template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates solid control with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery, though several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("tangled covenant," "mute eloquence"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting, particularly in descriptive passages that could achieve the same effect with more restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("time bloated or shrank like breath in the wind") but suffers from repetitive stems and occasional overwriting. Filter constructions like "She felt it" and "Elara realized" dull immediacy in key beats. The paraphrase loop between "mysteries unfolded" and "mysteries no longer anticipated but embraced" weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Phrases like "burnished hush" and "cobalt lagoon" risk becoming ornamental. The "as a kite string snaps" construction effectively marks the turn, though some passages lean toward overwriting that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose scaffolding appears throughout: "Rather than despair," "In that moment," "As he worked." Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("resolved to dedicate his remaining time to his deepest motivation—to foster interspecies respect"). The final paragraph especially suffers from summary mode and template phrasing that dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in metaphorical clusters ("bronze quiet" repetition, "luminous" appears frequently). The ending lands cleanly without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=6.4)
    Mixed success at line level - some beautiful phrases ("birds' voices...echoed like fragments of lost songs") but also overwriting and register drift. "Cataclysmic battles of merfolk legions" jars against the otherwise grounded mystical tone. Several sentences could be compressed without loss, and figurative density in places obscures momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose density works well in descriptive passages but creates momentum drag in places—"memories haunted him like ghosts in the haze" reads as filler. Several metaphors strain (leaf as "message from a greener world, a tinted revelation") and the riddle's presentation feels artificially inserted. The closing image of "chasing closeness across the scrap-strewn void" lands effectively despite earlier unevenness.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is moderate. Deductions for repetitive "echoed silence" phrase (4 uses), some template cadence in middle paragraphs, and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows well with varied sentence structure and strong imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance plot while building atmosphere. Some overwriting appears ("jealous lover," "betrayed spirit") and there's synonym churn around the chess pieces ("tainted/pure," "corrupted/renewal"). The "cautious abandon" oxymoron repeats without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "whispers here traveled unbroken, preserving the ephemeral" restates the gallery's function; "benevolently ruthless" appears multiple times with similar phrasing. Strong moments like "spelling 'RELEASE' in deliberate strides—right for R, a loop for E" show specificity, but abstract phrases like "humanity's core" and "quiet rebellion" lack concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Strong moments include "stone veins twisted into endless shelves" and the tactile feather sequence. However, abstract phrases like "hidden thunder" appear four times, creating repetitive metaphorical scaffolding. The story also relies on conceptual abstractions ("the shape of home," "buried talents") that could be more concretely embodied, and some passages edge toward purple prose without advancing story.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clear prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure, particularly in action sequences. Information density high in passages like the labyrinth description serving multiple purposes. Deductions for abstract phrases ("thick with unspoken regrets"), some redundancy between "exiled" status mentioned multiple times, and occasional overwriting in metaphorical language.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or theme simultaneously. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("forged hush" appears three times) and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("transforming singular guilt into multifaceted insights").

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Some redundancy appears ("uncertain alchemist" repeated, "quilting/quilted" used multiple times) and occasional overwriting ("fractured world," "tattered fabric of his own existence"). The paraphrase loop of mending/repair concepts across paragraphs 9-10 creates minor drag.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, with vivid imagery throughout. However, several overwrought metaphors accumulate ("lament for times," "treasures buried in the tide," "dissolved like foam") creating purple prose. The phrase "temporary eternity, moments stretched like taffy" mixes registers awkwardly, and some passages tend toward the ornamental rather than functional.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery, though some overwrought metaphors appear ("vibrations of intent," "screaming tenderness"). The phrase "screamed in silence, tender as a lover's plea" exemplifies the occasional strain for poetic effect over clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong imagistic density with lines doing multiple jobs: "eyes that gleamed like polished compasses" merges description with thematic purpose. However, "geography of loss" appears four times, creating mild repetition, and some abstract passages ("vast, uncharted territories where grief carved canyons") occasionally slow momentum. The syntactic variety and rhythmic control in peak moments partially offset these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=5.9)
    Several passages contain conceptual redundancy: "psychological safety" appears three times with near-identical meaning, "fractured grace" and "graceful fracture" create unnecessary echo. The prose suffers from abstract phrasing ("budding calm," "psychological haven taking root") that tells emotional states rather than embodying them. Template constructions appear: "She had come not just for... but for..." and "Elara had rationalized it perfectly" feel like scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("swirling like curious ghosts," "cutting through the mist like a softly persistent question") and repetitive use of "softly persistent" as modifier. The "borrowed memories" phrase appears five times, creating mild synonym churn.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "petals unfurling like living stars under the earth's veiled sun." The repeated "as the creek rises" creates intentional rhythm, though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("humid glow," "iridescent blues and golds") without harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong verb choices. However, several overwriting issues appear: "lacy menace of the encroaching dusk—delicate tendrils of fog weaving like intricate webs" feels overwrought, and metaphor density is high throughout. Some template phrasing appears ("Her heart raced," "breath came in measured gasps") that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("embers swirled like living stars") but suffers from abstract scaffolding ("scientifically romantic essence," "equations of emotion") and some template phrasing ("turned to her now," "felt the density"). The alchemical process description relies on telling rather than showing concrete transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("timelines bleeding into one another like ink on wet paper") but suffers from abstract telling and repetitive conceptual phrasing around chaos/narrative. Lines like "distilling chaos into narrative" appear in variations four times, creating synonym churn, and several sentences restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle dream sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptions of the clock mechanism. However, several abstract phrases weaken immediacy: "inner turmoil," "trembling calm" appears three times, "occluded views" twice. The metaphor "fog curling like whispered secrets" in the opening feels overwrought for the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some repetitive phrasing around "held breath" and "saturated hush" creates minor loops. Template cadence in "She [verb], the [noun]" pattern appears 3+ times, triggering deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=6.2)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, and the prose maintains forward momentum. However, several metaphors feel overwrought ("like a bridge built on shifting sands," "like rain on already flooded ground"), creating density without clarity. Some passages lean toward thesaurus-driven word choices ("ethereal," "spectral," "gritty") that accumulate without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.6)
    While individual sentences are crafted, there's significant overwriting with abstract philosophical language that dulls momentum ("These illusions had spawned wars of shadow and light, convincing souls that separation was truth"). The piece suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence carries figurative language without pattern-teaching payoff. Several paraphrase loops appear, like the redundant explanation of spiral arbitration.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong atmospheric control with vivid imagery like "bubbles formed inverted patterns, rising downward in defiance of nature." However, template cadence appears in repetitive "He/Elias" openings across multiple paragraphs, and some passages lean toward overwriting ("the invisible boundaries that defined existence"). The countdown sequence shows good rhythmic variation, but abstract philosophical language occasionally obscures concrete momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some figurative density in emotional beats ("quiet wildfire" appears 4 times). Minor template cadence in middle sections with "She [verb]" patterns. The technical/lyrical balance mostly works but occasionally tips purple in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=5.9)
    Prose tends toward purple with phrases like "clover melancholy—a bittersweet sorrow laced with faint, green-tinged hope" that prioritize ornament over momentum. Template cadence appears in "She'd dismissed...but now...it felt like" construction, and several paraphrase loops dilute impact ("Her method was unorthodox" followed by explanation repeats the unconventional nature).

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("melodically haunted" appears 5 times, "cultivated estrangement" 3 times) and template structures ("Elias would...", "They'd talk...", "He'd sit..."). The paraphrase loop "teaching endings how to begin, showing callers that every disconnection birthed a new possibility" restates without adding pressure. Information density is moderate; several sentences merely elaborate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=5.6)
    Several passages suffer from overwriting: "haunted euphoria—a joyous ache laced with spectral whispers" piles abstractions without advancing the scene. Template structures appear ("First, he uncorked..." "As he lowered...") creating mechanical progression. The prose reaches for literary effect through density of figurative language but often obscures rather than clarifies the actual events.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, world, and theme simultaneously. Minor template cadence appears in the rumor-chain sequence ("She passed it on... Theo caught it next...") and some filter-verb clustering ("Elias felt... Elias watched...") dulls immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("stars pausing in their eternal dance") but suffers from occasional overwriting—"subdued fire that illuminated his grief without consuming him" could be half as long. Template structures appear in the middle section ("He began to dowse... The ring trembled... As he walked..."), though the final passages regain momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive structures ("She would," "She responded," "She edited") and abstract telling in crucial beats. The phrase "profound peace" and "confidently uncertain heart swelled" rely on emotional labels rather than embodied sensation. Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive "quietly charismatic" (3x) and template constructions ("Elias began," "Thorne watched," "Elias lowered"). Several paraphrase loops diminish momentum ("mapping silence"/"charting the pauses"). Information density is moderate with some evocative imagery but frequent scaffolding phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("volcanic tenderness"/"tender as lava," repeated "forgotten promise"). Template cadence in discovery sequence ("First, he found...There, a mosaic...he arrived at"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("heart stirred with volcanic tenderness, a simmering passion beneath his calm exterior, tender as lava cooling into fertile earth"). Information density could be higher; some sentences merely elaborate rather than advance.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.8)
    While individual sentences achieve poetic effects ("at the hush of the universe inhaling"), the prose suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Template constructions like "She [verb], her [noun] [verbing]" repeat across multiple paragraphs, and abstract emotional descriptors ("auroral sorrow" appears twice) create synonym loops rather than progression.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is solid with most lines advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("twisting the skies into ribbons of unnatural light"), some repetitive phrasing around the whisper/shout contrast, and phrases like "calculated spontaneity" that feel more authorial than character-driven.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades: "spiralingly calm" appears three times, "half-spoken secret" four times, creating template cadence. Mixed metaphors clash ("swirling undercurrents" vs "stillwater tension"). The prose prioritizes atmospheric density over clarity, with repetitive stems ("She realized," "She wanted," "She felt") dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages building the chorus of doubts. Information density is generally strong. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "amplifying every unspoken breath" and "ethereal twilight" strain for effect, while some metaphors stretch thin ("forests of second thoughts" appears four times without evolution).

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful water imagery, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("tempests and hidden coves," "emerald and mist"). Template phrases appear ("It was said," "Whispers among the dock folk spoke") that could be tightened. The transformation sequence maintains momentum despite occasional density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong rhythmic control in the theatrical narrations contrasts effectively with quieter descriptive passages. However, several template constructions appear ("Elias sat," "He picked up," "She slipped inside") and abstract phrases like "emotional void" and "morally ambiguous" lack concrete specificity. The prose achieves clarity but misses opportunities for sharper sensory detail in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and atmospheric density. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, like "The colonnade responded, its quartz glowing with inner light, boundaries between the atrium and the frozen lake beginning to blur." Repetition of "aesthetically driven" (4x) and "lantern-moth hush" (3x) creates minor template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments like "glass sculptures, their imperfect forms twisting like frozen flames" but suffers from occasional overwriting and template cadence ("Elias waited... Elias smiled... Elias nodded"). Several instances of elevated diction ("ethereal entities," "harmonizing with the rustle") create distance. The repetitive "Elias [verb]" structure across multiple sentences creates monotony.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose clarity suffers from abstract density ("texture of connection," "intangible weave," "velvety echo") without concrete anchors. Template phrases appear ("heart raced," "trembling with power and gentleness"). The writing maintains competent flow but lacks the specific, embodied detail that would create momentum. Several passages could be cut without loss ("Virtual landscapes unfolded" paragraph adds little).

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant overwriting issues throughout: purple constructions ("curtains of intention—ethereal drapes that shimmered"), redundant phrasing ("aimless nights"/"wandering"), and template cadence in character introductions. The prose reaches for lyricism but often lands in abstraction ("threads of forgotten dreams," "captured comet") rather than precise imagery, creating drag especially in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "steadily curious" appears three times; "inherited mystery" four times as a phrase rather than dramatized quality. Template cadence runs appear ("Elara listened... Elara took... Elara showed"). The prose achieves competent clarity but lacks the compression and density expected at this level, with several sentences merely restating rather than advancing.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    Heavy overwriting throughout with purple prose like "tapestry of anguished joy" and "ethereal particles that floated like motes in sunbeams." Template phrases appear repeatedly ("steadily unpredictable" used 5 times), and abstract descriptors dominate over concrete action, creating density without clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments like "petals unfurled in luminous regret" but suffers from conceptual abstraction ("captured essences of human reverie") and some register elevation beyond the established voice. Information density is uneven, with the middle investigation sequence carrying less propulsion than opening and closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose achieves moments of atmospheric beauty but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("shedding layers" appears 4 times, "shimmering stillness" twice) and occasional purple patches. Lines like "the air thick with the scent of damp wood and earth" and "stars wheeling overhead like silent guardians" feel like writing-workshop standards rather than fresh observation.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of beauty but suffers from density issues - figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff pattern. Several paraphrase loops: "seeking closure often meant reliving the pain" followed by "as closure beckoned, the process opened wounds afresh." The "meteor hush" metaphor feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but several instances of overwriting: "hushed thunder" appears three times, some purple passages ("infinite theater," "symphony of the heart"). Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("incubate visions" shifts awkwardly). Information density is high but sometimes tips into ornamental description.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.2)
    Heavy reliance on abstract descriptors ("shadowed rapture," "ancient truth," "cosmic communion") creates opacity rather than clarity. Template phrases appear throughout: "drawn by whispers only she could perceive," "burned like a hidden flame," "fragment of the universe's grand narrative." The prose prioritizes atmospheric effect over precise meaning, with multiple paraphrase loops diluting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("blossoms whispering secrets to the wind"), it suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Phrases like "probabilistic echoes waiting to be realized" and "wave functions danced like ethereal lullabies" create opacity, and there's noticeable repetition of "fractured" and cultivation metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("vines twisted like coiled springs") but suffers from abstract philosophical language that dulls momentum ("the inexorable logic of invention and nature intertwined"). Template cadence appears in the grove sequence ("First, he approached... Next, he translocated... Finally, after another night's"). Several instances of telling over showing, particularly around the sixth sense concept. The paraphrase loop of "wild frontier of mind" variants reduces impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates rhythmic variety and some lovely phrases like "waves below urging her onward with a soothing cadence," but suffers from repetitive constructions ("gently persistent" appears twice) and abstract phrasing that reduces immediacy. Some sentences feel overworked with stacked modifiers ("slender vessel carved from driftwood, bobbing in a concealed cove").

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and atmospheric precision. Information density is generally high, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("silent-choir bellhop" concept reiterated). Notable issues include occasional overwriting ("seraphically mundane" feels forced) and some template phrasing around emotional states. The line "true safety demanded the risk of sound" borders on thesis statement.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose tends toward purple with phrases like "echoes of forgotten empires" and "starlit threads" that accumulate without always advancing story. Some template repetition ("She wrote," "She watched," "She confronted"). However, clarity remains strong and the accumulative structure justifies some density. Mixed metaphors like "chandelier collapsing" for a person's dissolution reduce precision.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves density through compound images ("solar-powered pods bobbing like forgotten buoys") and varies sentence length effectively. Some figurative language feels forced ("denial burned hotter than the sun") and occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("tone of drifting moored existence"). The revelation sequence maintains clear propulsion through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows rhythmic variety and atmospheric density, but overwriting appears in metaphor clusters ("skeletal guardians," "graveyard of dreams," "window to the stars"). The vision sequence contains paraphrase loops ("fragments...reassembling," "mess transforming into a map"). Template phrasing emerges in "She understood now" and "With awkwardly confident resolve."

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery, but several template constructions appear ("She spread...she puzzled...she deciphered"). The phrase "tradition evolved with intent" repeats verbatim three times, creating a thematic echo that borders on mechanical. Some figurative language feels forced ("curled like forgotten dreams").

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery ("sky rained fire," "pearl of stillness"). Minor redundancies appear ("anchor optimism in realism" echoed conceptually in "optimism felt grounded") and "quietly talented" reads as prompt-insertion rather than organic voice.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments like "shelves curved like the spine of a weary giant" but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Some metaphor mixing occurs ("luminescent ache" as both light and pain). Template cadence appears in the descent sequence ("Deeper he went...In the lowest vault..."). These artifacts don't touch closure but prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery, but suffers from overwriting in places: "frozen flames," "serene vortex," "breathing mandalas." Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around Elowen's anger being both "quiet fury" and "serene anger" and "calm rage." The density of figurative language in non-peak moments ("ghost-white," "bowstring," "frozen flames") dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose suffers from repetitive stems ("Elara + verb" patterns), synonym loops around "frozen/cold/frost," and abstract telling ("explosive revelations"). The "dizzying quiet" phrase appears seven times without evolving meaning. Template cadence emerges in emotional beats. However, basic clarity remains intact and the closure image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the dome's curved glass amplified the sun's tranquil blaze, casting a serene yet fierce light"). Some repetitive phrasing appears ("engraved quiet" variations), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy, but momentum remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good momentum, particularly in action sequences. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for scattered overwriting ("feral flowers," "auditory thickets," "ethereal remnant") and one instance of paraphrase loop ("his cool demeanor unbroken" following established coolness).

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose suffers from repetitive "orbit" metaphor (8+ instances) and occasional purple patches ("stars wheeled in silent judgment"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "intervene"/"intervention" cluster, redundant descriptions of the observatory's echoing quality. Information density varies; some sentences do multiple jobs while others merely restate.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("meteor hush," "yesterday's shadows mingled with tomorrow's light") and occasional template phrasing appears ("tears streamed down," "heart raced"). The clarity remains strong despite ornate passages.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages like "vibrant blues, earthy reds, and that pervasive lilac." Some redundancy appears in phrases like "murmurs blending into a cacophony" and "disorienting swirl" that restate similar ideas, and occasional overwriting ("testament to the unlearning's gentle power") dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently ("warm coldness," "cradle empathy in arms of steel," "balm against harsh remnants" cluster densely). Several abstract phrases like "gentle uprising" and "aberrant mercy" repeat without gaining specificity, creating mild loops.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose tends toward density without always earning it—phrases like "synesthetically blessed" and "ethereal light" feel templated rather than precise. The story suffers from register drift into elevated diction ("eternal stage," "luminous possibility") that doesn't match the intimate emotional register, and several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("seeking solace or perhaps oblivion" followed by similar restatements).

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues include the "willowglass" metaphor that extends without adding pressure ("bending like supple branches yet transparent as polished panes") and repetitive conceptual phrasing around "illuminating hidden pathways." Template cadence appears in emotional beats ("Affection swelled... skepticism softened... affection blooming"). The prose achieves moments of clarity but suffers from density without propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and purposeful technical vocabulary. However, paraphrase loops appear: "by mapping these sensations, she would speak for the enigmas" closely echoes earlier "to become the voice of the unknown." Template cadence runs through "Elara [verb]" constructions. The final paragraph's abstract promises ("would ensure the unknown was heard") replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Round ones with pearl sheen spoke of calm seas" combines description, cataloging action, and thematic resonance. Sentence variety creates appropriate rhythm, particularly in the cataloging sequence. However, some passages contain mild redundancy ("shared wisdom" appears four times) and occasional abstract phrasing ("raw possibility," "boundless grains") that could be more concrete. The prose generally maintains momentum toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally clean with varied rhythm, though some passages lean toward the abstract ("tapestry of shadows," "dormant spark"). Information density is good in action sequences. Deduction for repetitive "silver" usage (appears 5 times) and occasional scaffold phrases that could be cut for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.6)
    The prose demonstrates strong atmospheric control with varied sentence lengths and rich sensory detail. Information density is generally good, with most lines advancing atmosphere or discovery. However, several instances of elevated diction ("palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity") feel forced rather than organic, and some passages loop conceptually, particularly around the "distilling complexity" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation and strong opening/closing images. Information density is good. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("resilience that change could not erode" followed by similar restatements) and some elevated diction in the timeline section ("residual essence") creates register drift from Elias's grounded voice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in action sequences. However, several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("instill renewal," "vigil," "ethereal") and some repetitive phrasing appears ("wistfully pragmatic" twice, multiple uses of "quivering hush"). The writing is competent but occasionally overwrought, particularly in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths and evocative imagery like "whisper of waves that never touched earth." However, several instances of abstract telling ("fierce independence," "profound loneliness") and some repetitive phrasing around isolation/independence concepts reduce momentum. The "brittle awakenings" metaphor risks overuse across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.6)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. However, repetitive "keeper of secrets" appears three times, and some passages lean purple ("mist-shrouded dawn," "kaleidoscope of fanciful notions"). The phrase "inevitably whimsical" reads as forced insertion rather than organic description. Information density is moderate but could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "defiant needle," "ethereal beings of light and shadow," and abstract phrases like "quiet victory in this ethereal game of cosmic chess." Some repetitive phrasing ("power plays" appears 6 times) creates mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with dense figurative language ("tunnels converged like forgotten veins," "winter's hush," "shadow like a promise"). Template phrasing appears ("Elias felt," "he watched," "he pondered"). Information density is uneven—some sentences do multiple jobs while others merely elaborate. The organ sequence achieves strong momentum despite occasional purple patches.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    Several passages suffer from abstract telling and repetitive phrasing ("methodical/methodically" appears multiple times, "dormant empathy" repeats). Lines like "unification of opposites: the chaos of decay with the order of art" explain rather than embody. The prose achieves moments of clarity but accumulates enough scaffolding and conceptual redundancy to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm, particularly in atmospheric passages. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("humidity-soaked corridors," "spongey dread," multiple metaphors for absorption) and some redundancy in describing the station's oppressive atmosphere across multiple paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose shows strong moments ("road twisted like a forgotten melody") but suffers from overwriting and repetition. The phrase "luminous disbelief" appears four times, "dynamically observant" three times, creating template cadence. Mixed metaphors appear ("ember" burning while "sculpting from ashes"). The "after the hitchhiker vanishes" construction reads awkwardly, and several sentences paraphrase adjacent content.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, particularly in the startup sequence. However, several abstract formulations weaken immediacy ("driven by a quiet motivation," "embodied a polished calm"), and the final paragraph contains explicit thematic summary ("paths circle back to teach resilience"). Some metaphors strain ("double-edged blade" for legacy).

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues throughout: abstract phrases like "fluid boundaries between wakefulness and slumber," "perpetual night of her vigils," and "eternal dance of variable stars" create purple prose without advancing story. Template phrasing appears in "Elara's heart stirred" and "understanding dawned." The final paragraph contains three instances of "shared burden" variants, creating repetitive loops.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several template phrases weaken momentum: "pounding like a war drum," "cold as frozen steel," "grace of a warrior in meditative trance." Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot but some rely on familiar fantasy descriptors. The expanding circles structure provides good syntactic variety, though combat descriptions use predictable verb choices ("lashing," "snaking," "sought to impale").

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("sky bled indigo hues"). However, abstract phrases accumulate ("ethereal possibilities," "veils between realities," "nexus where individual subconscious realms converged") creating density without precision. Some template constructions ("One by one," "There, at the nexus") and elevated register in peak beats ("embodied the intersection of dreams").

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. However, several instances of paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "fiercely gentle nature"/"fiercely gentle gaze," "bartered destinies"/"destinies could be bartered," and repetitive use of "half-lit corridors." Some elevated diction occasionally drifts from Elara's established register ("dusky resolve," "spectral figure"). Information density is good but these redundancies prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Strong moments include "dust motes danced in the slanted afternoon light" and the tactile description of the speaker cloth. However, several template phrases appear: "confidently uncertain" repeats three times, "echo valley longing" feels forced, and abstract constructions like "insulating emotionally with facts" recur without variation. The final sentence overreaches with "longing hum of purpose reborn."

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from ornamental figurative language ("spectral weights pulling at his heart with insistent gravity") and repetitive transition metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. The phrase "touching distance" appears three times without evolving meaning, and several passages loop similar concepts about transition and connection.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose achieves moments of vivid imagery but suffers from abstraction and telling. Key emotional states are labeled ("rage," "peace," "serene satisfaction") rather than embodied. Template cadence appears in the ritual sequence ("He opened... He watched... He closed"). The line "Wonder endures" attempts resonance but lacks the earned weight of dramatized struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery like "shimmering stalactite curtain" and maintains decent momentum through the discovery sequence. However, template cadence appears in the confession sequence ("As he recited...As he held it..."), and abstract phrasing like "fractures in his soul" and "sanctuary for the soul" dulls specificity. The final paragraph's "bearer of hope" and "unity was crowned" read as thesis statements rather than earned imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some redundancy appears in phrases like "forgotten since the lines were rerouted decades ago" followed by "stood as a relic of paths diverged." Minor template cadence in "Elias sat...Elias stepped out" construction. The accordion description as "patched with tape, a heirloom" could be smoother. Strong moments like "Rivers don't regret their floods" elevate despite these friction points.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose suffers from template cadence in places ("Elara watched...Elara's veiled eyes widened...Elara proceeded") and abstract emotional descriptors that resist embodiment. Information density is moderate with some paraphrase loops around the cyclical reversal concept. The line "weight of words finally set free" attempts resonance but lands as cliché rather than earned culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.4)
    While individual sentences often achieve lyrical beauty ("melody emerged, crystalline and piercing"), the prose suffers from repetitive "mulberry ache" phrases and abstract declarations that slow momentum. Several passages paraphrase the same concept ("dream versus empire" appears in multiple forms), and filter-heavy constructions like "she felt fates shifting" dull immediacy in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong imagery with "ribbons of emerald and violet" and "brushes of feather-soft crystal," maintaining momentum through varied sentence lengths. Information density is high, with most lines advancing ritual or atmosphere. Minor repetitions ("radiant hush" appears 4 times, "lucidly watchful" 3 times) create intentional echo but risk becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and evocative imagery, but several passages contain abstract emotional summaries ("battered by lifetimes of regret," "fragile spirit") rather than concrete embodiment. Some filter-heavy constructions ("she realized," "she knew") diminish immediacy during key revelatory moments.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax, but several abstract loops dilute momentum: "sincere concern"/"sincerely insincere," "protected vulnerability"/"guarded emotion." The phrase "welcome nuance into certainty" appears verbatim twice, and some metaphors strain ("hollow echoes of clients' doubts").

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=4.8)
    Repetitive phrasing pervades: "withheld/withholding" appears 7 times, "hush" 8 times, creating synonym churn. Template cadence emerges in parallel constructions ("Elara guided... Elara withheld... Elara watched"). Overwriting appears in phrases like "twinkling veil of night" and "dawn's hesitant light" that prioritize poeticism over clarity. Information density remains low with multiple sentences restating concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.7)
    Sentences vary in length and structure, creating readable rhythm, but numerous instances of overwriting appear: "spectral ravens with wings like shards of night," "monuments to bygone eras," "the slow march of time." Template phrasing recurs ("centuries of layered dust" appears twice nearly verbatim). The prose prioritizes ornamental description over narrative propulsion, though no major clarity issues or loops damage comprehension.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance atmosphere or story. However, several template patterns appear ("Elowen believed...," "Elowen closed his eyes...," "Elowen's heart raced...") and figurative language occasionally strains ("frozen needle," "mechanical mimicry of creation").

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the velvet hush of midnight") but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"wandered purposefully" appears twice, "meteor hush" three times. The tag exposition paragraph contains unnecessary scaffolding ("explaining how," "But it hid behind truth"). Information density is good overall but these redundancies and the slightly overworked metaphors prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm in passages like "Stars, once vibrant, now lingered as phantom glows in her memory, seeding a stellar doubt that whispered of eternal night." However, repetitive constructions appear ("She believed that," "Elara knew," "Elara nodded") and some metaphors strain (static as "droplets of data" in a "still"). The phrase "wavelength align with purpose" repeats verbatim three times without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some metaphorical density in peak beats ("shadows that whispered," "walls...seemed to pulse") without clear payoff. Minor template cadence in "One by one...A phrase materialized...Another echo followed" sequence detracts from otherwise strong prose.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose suffers from abstract labels and telling rather than embodiment: "lukewarm mage," "earnestly naive," "brittle devotion" appear as declarations. Template phrases like "burned within him" and "trembling hands" lack specificity. The ritual sequence maintains clarity but relies on repetitive structure ("First, he traced... Drops fell... He counted...") without syntactic variety.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments of clarity and momentum, particularly in the photograph discovery sequence. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. However, abstract phrases proliferate ("mirrored silence," "echoed his own reflective thoughts," "spin stories into shared meaning") without sufficient grounding. Template cadence appears in the photograph sequence ("The first photo...He picked it up...The third photograph"), and "mirrored hush" repeats three times without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=4.8)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence ("auburn hair caught fractured light, shimmering like embers in a forge"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the harmony theme repeated in lines 5, 9, 19, 27. Template cadence emerges in the transformation sequence with repetitive "She [verb]" constructions. The prose prioritizes ornamental description over narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrasing ("watcher's burden," "soundless echo") appears repeatedly without always advancing pressure. Strong information density in the evacuation sequence. Template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions appears in middle sections. The paraphrase loop around "muscle memory" in paragraphs 11-13 dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose maintains clarity and forward momentum with varied sentence structures, particularly in action sequences. Information density is generally strong, with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. However, some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("strange anomalies invaded," "vibrant and emotive"), and metaphorical language occasionally reaches for effect over precision ("swirling nebulae where gravity bent"). The text is clean of mechanical errors but lacks the specific textural detail that would elevate it.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting mars the prose: "pulsing with unspoken potential," "whisper from the unknown," "storm-born silence" pile figurative language densely without clear purpose. Template phrases like "the air crisp and heavy" and repetitive "orthogonal" usage (6 times) create monotony. The final paragraph's abstract declarations ("innovation flowed eternal") replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "autumn leaves danced like notes on a staff." Some overwriting in metaphor density ("twisted like veins," "whisper of the man," "specter") and occasional abstraction ("weight of things left unsaid," "shadowed grief"). The repeated "mournfully eager" works as pattern but borders on mannered. Information density is good but could be tighter in the middle transformation sequences.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong moments of vivid imagery and rhythmic control appear throughout, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops, particularly in the middle section where the interiorization process is described multiple times with slight variations. Abstract philosophizing about boundaries and light creates density without propulsion. Filter constructions like "It visualized" and "It had learned" accumulate without serving voice.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments like "embers flickering like dying stars against the encroaching night" but suffers from abstract descriptors and telling phrases throughout ("stoically sensitive grace," "feeling every pang deeply but voicing none"). Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the curse and Elias's emotional state. Template phrasing emerges in the approximation sequence ("First, he placed..." "Again, he reformed..." "On the third approximation...") though this partially serves the methodical pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery—"moon hung swollen and insistent, pulling tides and tempers alike" compresses multiple tensions effectively. However, paraphrase loops appear: "endings hid seeds of renewal"/"turning loss into a practical quest for hidden starts" restate without advancement. Filter verb stack in vision sequence ("she saw") dulls immediacy at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting appears throughout, particularly in descriptive passages: "spectral grotto under starlight, where glowing stalactites hung like frozen comets and the water lapped at ethereal shores" stacks modifiers without advancing story. Template phrasing like "ever the optimist" and "ardent spirit unwavering" creates distance rather than immediacy. The resolution sequence explaining the hourglass mechanics feels more like exposition than dramatized action, though some lyrical moments land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some conceptual loops appear ("memories alter" repeated three times, "texture of connection" four times without evolution). Filter-verb clusters in emotional peaks ("he recalled," "he saw," "he understood") and elevated diction ("fevered visions," "rational enchantment") occasionally slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose demonstrates competent craft with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery. However, several instances of overwriting appear ("the revelation brought a somber marvel—a quiet wonder laced with the melancholy of lost simplicities") and abstract philosophizing slows momentum. The phrase "somber marvel" appears three times, creating unnecessary repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose demonstrates solid clarity with atmospheric phrases like "fog swirled like forgotten breaths" creating texture. Information density is moderate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. However, several instances of elevated diction ("unyielding motivation," "persistently curious nature") and repetitive phrasing around "vulnerable voices" and "reeling hush" create mild scaffold that prevents higher scoring, though these don't touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from abstraction ("vital arteries carrying the world's whispers") and repetitive structure ("Alex felt...Alex opened...Alex mapped"). The phrase "crashing hush" works initially but becomes overused. Several sentences could be cut without loss, particularly the explanatory passages about the facility's history.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=6.0)
    Several passages show strong imagery ("ink bloom into fleeting shapes," "pixels coalesced"), but repetitive structures appear throughout ("Alex's motivation burned clear," "Alex smiled," "Alex retrieved"). The phrase "midnight solace" repeats, and abstract descriptors like "haunting silence" and "ethereal" lack specificity. Template cadence emerges in the ritual sequence with multiple "He [verb]" constructions, though the prose remains generally clear.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks that mirror the story's rhythmic concerns. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("copper light that matched his veins") approaches overwriting, and occasional abstract phrasing ("volatile force") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple instances of overwriting weaken momentum: "festered like a winter root," "gravitationally playful tug," "harmonious discord." Template phrasing appears in "her heart, frostbitten by hope that refused to die, urged her onward." The transformation sequence relies on abstract telling ("bitterness ebbed, transmuting") rather than concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("gears whispered instead of leaves") and varied sentence structure. However, the phrase "resonantly soft" appears four times without meaningful variation, creating a loop. Abstract constructions like "felt clarity dawn" and "surge of resolve" replace concrete sensory detail in peak moments, reducing immediacy during the climactic transformation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from template cadence ("Elias arrived...," "Elias nodded...," "Elias smiled...," "Elias uncorked...") and abstract declarations ("respectfully rebellious," "brittle hush"). Some vivid moments shine ("thunderstorm in a bottle...swirling with miniaturized lightning") but paraphrase loops appear ("linking absences" repeated without variation) and the final paragraph relies on telling rather than scene.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory detail and varied sentence structure, though some overwriting appears ("skeletal remains of an abandoned circus train, its cars splayed like forgotten dreams"). The repetition of "misting hush," "whispering gleam," and "quietly persistent" creates pattern but occasionally feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Some abstract phrasing ("fabric of existence itself," "eternal wellspring") and occasional filter constructions ("In her mind's eye") prevent higher scoring, but no major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that support the accumulative structure. Information density is high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or emotion. However, several abstract labels ("luminous absence," "cipher of longing," "improbable beginnings") recur without evolving meaning, and some metaphors strain ("library... like a forgotten thought").

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose has moments of beauty but suffers from overwriting: "shadowed nexus where forgotten paths converged under eternal starlight" in the opening alone. Template repetition appears ("Elias gazed," "Elias clutched," "Elias positioned"). Mixed metaphors ("vortex of enveloped secrets where up became down and time looped") muddle clarity in crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure. However, several abstract telling passages weaken momentum ("Her chronically curious nature had led her," "memories vanished, stolen by whatever entity"). Some overwritten metaphors ("shipwrecks formed a jagged corona"). The resolution paragraph contains multiple abstraction loops.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in places ("dust motes danced like forgotten dreams") and some template structures. Several paraphrase loops appear (reversible exile explained multiple times). Line "Foolish boy, it's reversible" feels forced. Information density is uneven with some scaffolding phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    Several instances of repetitive phrasing weaken momentum: "insatiably creative" appears three times unchanged, "radiant hush" repeats four times. The prose occasionally drifts into overwriting with stacked modifiers ("wise, knowing hand," "vibrant hue fading"). However, sentence variety is strong and the closing image lands effectively without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence lengths and rhythmic modulation, particularly in descriptions of the sanctuary's prismatic effects. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. However, several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("lucid unrest" appears three times), and there's occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages that slightly obscures clarity without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from abstract phrasing ("deep-seated need to interpret silence with empathy," "portal to forgotten empathies") and occasional template cadence in description. Lines like "centuries of seepage had blurred the once-vivid murals" show strong specificity. Some paraphrase loops around the silence/empathy concept reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is generally strong. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("elusive force binding souls"), some filter constructions ("he saw parallels"), and occasional overwriting ("hypnotic dance," "eerie silence").

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong moments of propulsion ("clicked and whirred, imprinting deeper layers") with varied sentence structures. Information density high in encoding sequences. However, abstract scaffolding appears ("Long ago," "Now," "Suddenly"), and some passages loop concepts ("unspoken needs, those deep yearnings for connection and freedom" restates rather than advances). Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle ("ghost in code" versus "spectral minstrel" creates competing vehicles).

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose clarity suffers from overwriting in places ("clouds like a frozen needle," "fireflies," "elusive") and template cadence across floor progressions ("Fifth floor... Sixth floor..."). Information density is moderate but several paragraphs could be cut without losing essential pressure, particularly the middle diary revelations that repeat similar emotional territory.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("dusty starlight filtered through high-altitude haze like ancient light through cobwebs") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Multiple sentences begin with similar constructions ("He began," "He adjusted," "Heart pounding, Elias began"). The metaphor density in emotional beats sometimes obscures clarity, particularly the "quietly explosive" paradox that never fully resolves.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty—"blues deeper than midnight, whites flecked with starlight"—but suffers from occasional abstraction and repetitive "heightened stillness" phrase (used 4 times). Some template cadence in "She [verb], [verb-ing]" constructions. Information density is good but several sentences could be compressed without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from repetitive structures ("Elias had always been," "Elias's motivation," "Elias's notes") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages. Strong moments like "starlings dancing" and "living ink" provide vivid imagery. Multiple filter constructions ("he felt," "he noticed," "seemed to") accumulate to create distance, while some sentences loop concepts without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, but suffers from repetitive nostalgic loops ("driftwood nostalgia," "weathered wood ashore," "waveswept bark") and occasional overwriting in figurative density. Template cadence appears in "She had come... She wandered... She gathered" structures. The final paragraph contains some summary-telling that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose flows adequately but suffers from repetitive constructions and generic descriptors ("ragtag group," "unbreakable bonds," "fragile peace"). Multiple instances of telling over showing ("strangely trustworthy" repeated as label rather than demonstrated). Some overwriting in metaphorical language ("brambled paths where hope tangled with doubt") that adds little pressure or specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric beauty ("where the sea met the sky in eternal dusk") but suffers from abstract loops and elevated register that occasionally obscures clarity. Phrases like "the hush of time's final ripple" repeat without variation, and "bruised awe" appears three times without deepening. Template cadence emerges in the final third ("Or perhaps...," "His own lifetime...," "The pane resealed...").

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally propels with varied syntax and strong imagery. Information density is high in action sequences. However, several passages contain mild redundancy ("graceless beauty" appears as both description and thematic summation) and occasional overwriting in metaphorical density during setup passages.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages of the ravine. However, several instances of template phrasing appear ("pieces fell into place" used three times, "loosened grief" twice) and some emotional transitions rely on abstract telling ("grief evolving into hopeful anticipation") rather than embodied showing. The figurative density occasionally overwhelms in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery ("fruits of forgotten tomes," "liquid light spill onto a central slate"), though some passages contain conceptual loops ("mindfully scattered...scattered mindfully"). The phrase "quantifying absence" appears three times without variation, and abstract formulations like "pure potential, a blank expanse pulsing with unborn words" reduce immediacy in the climactic beat.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose shows strong moments - "bitter remorse like overripe fruit, sweet joys as honeyed reductions" effectively uses culinary metaphor. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "silent haunt, filled with echoes of regrets" feels redundant, and phrases like "urgent pull to confront them" lack specificity. The final paragraph rushes through transformation without adequate pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=5.0)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language: "threads of silver," "eternal tick," "ethereal fingers." Mixed metaphors muddle clarity—Elara's voice is simultaneously "threads," "melody," and "weaving." Template phrases like "vigorous tender" appear repeatedly without variation. The prose prioritizes atmosphere over propulsion, creating beautiful but static passages.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.8)
    Significant overwriting pervades the piece with redundant metaphors ("helix-minded" appears multiple times, "chaotically precise" twice) and abstract loops that restate rather than advance. Lines like "Through synaptic plasticity, the brain's innate method of rewiring connections, strengthening some pathways while pruning others" read as exposition rather than lived experience. The prose lacks the concision and momentum required for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.4)
    Significant overwriting appears throughout: "latent blaze" repeats four times as an empty intensifier, while phrases like "refracting like light through crystal, splitting singular ideas into multifaceted possibilities" exemplify unnecessary elaboration. Template constructions plague action sequences ("Elara felt...," "She clutched...," "She watched..."). The prose achieves moments of clarity but stumbles on redundant modifiers and conceptual loops that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure supporting the contemplative pace. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Significant deductions for repetitive phrasing around "empathy in motion" (appears 4 times), some template constructions ("She wandered," "She studied," "She positioned"), and occasional overwriting ("spiderwebbed from the center, like crescendo lines in a symphony building to a peak").

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("where compasses spun wildly and auroras whispered secrets to the dusk"). Information density is high with most sentences carrying multiple functions. However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("correlating fragments," "translating silence") and some metaphors strain (silence "screaming volumes"). Minor repetition of "correlate" variants.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences ("shadows deepened, amplifying the pre-fireworks calm—a profound stillness where even the wind held its breath"). Multiple template constructions appear ("First came... Next, tuning higher..."). The final paragraph contains explicit theme statement ("empathy bloomed not in confrontation, but in tuning to the frequencies") that replaces scene pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues throughout, particularly metaphor density ("mists that danced like forgotten secrets," "turning of the tide's thought"). Multiple paraphrase loops appear, especially around the serenity/motion concept restated across adjacent sentences. The prose lacks momentum in places, with ornamental description slowing key beats. Template cadence appears in the journaling sequence ("She would write... she would doodle...").

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and clear spatial choreography during the inversion sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "whirling silence" repeated four times, "echoes" conceptually recycled without advancement. The phrase "source of resilience" appears three times unchanged. Information density is moderate—many sentences describe without advancing character or conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum through active verbs and varied sentence structures. Information density is adequate, with most lines advancing the investigation or atmosphere. Deductions for repetitive "singular convergence" usage, some purple patches ("fog clung like a shroud," "silence had fallen like a guillotine"), and the final paragraph's abstract telling that replaces concrete imagery with theme statements about "foresight" and "motivation forged anew."

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=4.9)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with dense figurative language ("sculpted hush," "oscillating repose") that obscures rather than clarifies. Multiple instances of abstract phrasing and synonym repetition ("unfetter/freeing," "sculpted/chiseled"). The extended sculptor metaphor feels forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several passages contain repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops: "driven relic keeper...devoted to safeguarding artifacts" and the redundant explanation of the flute's power. The "avalanchingly quiet" concept is explained twice in similar terms. Template fantasy constructions appear ("ancient canyons carved by forgotten storms"). However, the ritual sequence maintains good momentum, and key moments avoid overwriting. Information density is uneven, with some paragraphs doing single jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=5.6)
    Significant overwriting issues: "hulking relic of brass and ink," "velvet sky like forgotten equations," "mosaic of borrowed fragments." Mixed metaphors proliferate (stars as equations, workshop humming with decay, personality as coat). Template cadence appears in "Elias felt...He felt...He pressed..." sequence. The prose reaches for literary effect but sacrifices clarity and momentum, particularly in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sentence rhythm varies effectively between longer descriptive passages and shorter moments of exchange, with the pendant's "hum" and "vibration" creating sonic texture. Some phrases approach template territory ("etched with lines of endless harvests," "forgotten hopes") and the epilogue's summary mode loses the immediacy of the central scene, though no major loops or scaffolding impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("mist clung to crystalline branches like forgotten secrets") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Template cadence appears in "Elara approached... Elara closed... Elara nodded" sequence. Several instances of elevated diction clash with grounded mysticism ("profound, altered silence," "spectral rainbows"). Information density is moderate with some redundant emotional labeling.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    Pervasive abstract phrasing ("hush of time's unraveling tapestry," "raveling silence," "latent sacrifice") creates opacity without teaching a pattern that pays off. Template cadence appears in "She spent her days... The orchard... Elara's eyes..." openings, and the prose relies on telling abstractions over concrete image, particularly in describing emotional states as "wistful" and "stoically sparkling."

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=5.2)
    Repetitive phrasing weakens momentum ("azure defiance" appears four times, "deliberately" three times, extensive "bartered awakenings" iterations). The prose tends toward overwriting with phrases like "whispers of cosmic neglect" and "frozen waves" that prioritize atmosphere over clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments ("rusted tools whispered echoes of forgotten voyages") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("defying prediction," "spontaneous visions flashing") and occasional template cadence in the weaving sequences. Information density is uneven—some sentences merely restate ("cyclically spontaneous" appears without adding pressure). The filter-verb stack ("feeling it attune," "feeling it redirect") dulls immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("waves curled like secrets") but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "luminescent ache" (appears 4 times) and some template cadence in the middle section. Several sentences could be cut without loss, particularly in the backstory passages. The filter-verb stack in "Elias had felt it himself" and "He could feel their luminescent ache" dulls immediacy during crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from overwriting in places ("spectral figure, her form woven from mist and memory"). Several passages loop conceptually without advancing—the explanation of total internal reflection and light manipulation repeats across multiple paragraphs. Template phrases like "under the vast canopy of stars" and "jagged cliff" lack specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("clouds clung to jagged peaks like forgotten dreams") with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, abstract constructions proliferate in the middle section ("magnetizing his own narrative," "illuminating paths for others"), and the "quietly explosive" oxymoron recurs without earning its paradox. Some metaphors strain credibility (tea tasting "of distant storms").

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of beauty ("moonlight pooled on the floor like spilled mercury") but suffers from density issues. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the sextant's properties being explained multiple times. Template cadence in "Elias + verb" constructions. Overwriting in peak beats with mixed metaphors (sorrow as both "angles and arcs" and having "core elements").

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery ("fruits pulsed brighter, their alchemical glow spreading") but suffers from abstract descriptors and repetitive constructions. Multiple instances of template phrasing appear ("One by one," "As she sang," "These spirits") and abstract terms like "ethereal" recur without adding specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=5.6)
    Prose clarity generally serves the story, but several issues accumulate: template phrasing ("Elias positioned himself," "Elias listened," "Elias felt"), abstract descriptors ("enlarged tranquility," "vast calm"), and conceptual redundancy (multiple restatements of the isolation/connection paradox). The line "staying while leaving—physically present, yet mentally detached, observing without engaging" paraphrases itself. These artifacts don't destroy comprehension but significantly dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose suffers from abstraction loops and telling phrases: "Absolution felt tenuous, a fragile pardon he chased but never fully grasped, like mist slipping through fingers" restates the same idea three ways. Template constructions appear ("He had watched," "He'd achieve," "He stepped out"). Several sentences could be cut without loss, particularly the redundant philosophical statements about normalcy.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and paragraph lengths creating visual rhythm. Information density is high - most sentences advance atmosphere, action, and theme simultaneously. However, some redundancy appears: "fading/fade/faded" variants occur 8 times; "gently meticulous" repeats verbatim. The magic system description maintains clarity despite complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some overwriting appears ("flickered like uneasy stars," "bones of men like her father") but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density is generally strong with most lines advancing plot or atmosphere. The "comforting unease" phrase appears twice, creating minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with vivid sensory details and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, particularly in world-building passages. However, several instances of telling over showing ("her skepticism luminous in the dim glow") and some redundancy in describing the taste changes. The phrase "terrestrially cosmic" appears three times, creating unnecessary repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "auroral sorrow" concept repeats without evolution, "suppressed creativity" restates across multiple paragraphs. Template cadence appears in "He would create... He needed to rectify... He kneeled..." sequence. Information density is uneven—the mechanism description provides good specificity but earlier passages circle their concepts without advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong images like "vines twisted like veins." Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("perpetual orange glow," "cascade of her lost words") and slight template cadence in the discovery sequence ("She found... She selected... She reread").

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("clouds swirled below like forgotten dreams") with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. However, template cadence appears in middle sections ("She began...First, she forged...Into this, she embedded"), and some metaphorical density in non-peak moments ("liquid resolve") reduces momentum. Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong moments like "memories clashing like storm clouds." However, some overwriting appears in metaphor density ("tapestry of integrated fragments") and occasional template phrasing ("calculated her options"). Minor scaffold in expository segments but momentum maintains through action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose is generally clean but suffers from repetitive structures ("Elena [verb]," "She [verb]"). Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("stories emerged—regrets, apologies, enduring loves" followed by three examples saying the same thing). Overuse of participial phrases creates simultaneity confusion. Some purple moments ("veil of serenity over potential chaos").

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows strong moments ("where rusted consoles flickered with bioluminescent algae") but suffers from abstraction loops: "mysterious familiarity" appears twice verbatim, "calm defiance" repeats three times. The filter-heavy construction "she would twirl, her limbs tracing arcs" dulls immediacy during a key beat. Information density varies—some sentences do multiple jobs while others merely restate ("time blurred in the dim, pressurized haze").

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery ("waves to hang suspended mid-crash"). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Some elevated diction ("exhume fragments," "ethereal void") creates minor register drift. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose flows smoothly but suffers from overwriting in places ("terrestrially cosmic sanctuary," "insidious spread through dreams and omens"). Several passages restate similar concepts without adding pressure, particularly around the prophecy's threat. The heavy use of abstract modifiers ("tranquil blaze," "smoothed hush") creates distance rather than immediacy, though line-level clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several template phrases weaken momentum: "cluttered study," "burning motivation," "crumbling city." The phrase "patiently nimble" appears twice identically. Strong moments like "buildings gossiping in dead dialects" elevate, but scaffold phrases and some purple prose ("stars piercing the sky") create drag.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures, particularly during the resonance sequence. However, several instances of abstract telling weaken immediacy: "ghostly resolve," "tragically radiant" appear as labels rather than embodied states. Some figurative language borders on overwriting ("petals unfurled like whispered secrets under a canopy of fading indigo") without clear payoff at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves density through lines doing multiple jobs: "Time here unfolded as stalactites drip, each slow plop echoing the patient rhythm of centuries." Some repetitive phrasing around "calibrated" and occasional overwriting ("pearl twilight" appears three times). The sanctuary description maintains momentum while building atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.8)
    Multiple instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy: "reed-blown melancholy" appears twice, "webs of intrigue" relies on the prompt element rather than fresh imagery. Template cadence appears in the resolution sequence ("She had learned, and in learning, ensured"). The prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from overwriting in emotional beats and repetitive structural patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from abstract phrasing ("fragment of untainted soul," "windows of connection") that could be more concrete. Several paraphrase loops appear, particularly around the ghost communication concept being restated without added pressure. The "borrowed starlight" metaphor works but risks overextension.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "fleeting lights," "frothy revelations," "ephemeral art" cluster decorative language. Some philosophical passages approach abstraction without concrete anchoring: "the essence of hidden effort in every living thing" lacks specificity. Information density is moderate—many sentences do single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose generally propels with varied sentence structures and purposeful detail. Information density is high when describing the diamond's properties and the letters' revelation. Some template phrasing appears ("Hours passed as he reassembled") and occasional overwriting ("radiating an inner fire that seemed to pulse"), but momentum sustains through the investigation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without clear pattern-teaching. Multiple instances of elevated diction ("umbras birthing light's first kiss") clash with supposed isolation. The text loops conceptually around storms, shadows, and frequencies without sufficient variation. Several purple passages ("colossal beast," "ephemeral arts") dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=5.4)
    Overwriting pervades the piece with dense figurative language ("sand sifted like forgotten whispers," "painting solitude in hues of gold and blue") that often does single-duty work. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("He wandered... but always returned," "He believed... This belief shaped"). The prose prioritizes lyricism over momentum, creating drag especially in the opening third.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variety and purposeful paragraph structure, but overwriting accumulates—"whispering against his skin like a lover's breath" and similar flourishes appear too frequently. Template phrases like "fleshly pull" and "ethereal call" recur mechanically. Information density is moderate; several sentences could do more work, particularly in the setup.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("jagged black rocks formed ancient walls against the wind"). However, abstract noun clusters appear frequently ("vigilant horizon mapper," "restrained wildness," "softly purposeful"), and some sentences rely on telling rather than embodiment. The phrase "patient revolution" appears four times, creating mild repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.2)
    Several instances of abstract telling weaken momentum: "fortified vulnerability," "entangled memories," "collective spirit of the unfree" remain conceptual rather than embodied. The phrase "watchfully calm" appears three times with minimal variation, and key beats like the incantation lack concrete sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, particularly in atmospheric descriptions. However, several instances of overwriting ("vibrant hush" appears three times, "aptly deliberate" twice) and some purple passages ("melodies frozen in time," "ethereal precision") create density without always advancing story, dulling momentum in places.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=5.2)
    Overwriting pervades high-pressure moments: "ceaseless churn," "defiant cork," "toxic expanse" cluster densely without payoff. Template cadence appears in "Elias's steadily curious mind...evolving his plans" followed immediately by "evolving the algorithm." The phrase "throughout the evolution" repeats mechanically four times. These artifacts dull momentum despite some vivid specific details.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures, particularly in action sequences. Information density is high in pattern-discovery passages. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("deleted files truly went...hidden in some shadowy repository" echoes the same concept) and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("she felt the sensed absence keenly").

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "courageous anomaly" appears as a label, "empathy alone was inert" tells what's being shown, and phrases like "living ink" and "silent sentinels" accumulate without always advancing the story. The reconstitution sequence maintains better clarity with concrete image-to-action mapping. Some redundancy appears in explaining Elara's motivation multiple times.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "clutched in her gloved palm" and "groans of shifting ice" demonstrate precision. However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("echoes of lives upended," "preludes to finality," "undercurrents of loss") and some paraphrase loops appear ("approaching endings"/"sound of approaching endings").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose suffers from overwriting ("liquid gold in the autumn air," "twisted by seasons, yet enduring") and abstract descriptors ("gentle soul," "quiet invitation," "subtle passion"). Template phrases appear throughout ("ever the gentle soul," "something in his calm eyes"), and the text explicitly names concepts like "intersubjective understanding" and "gently persuasive" from the prompt.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.4)
    Strong moments like "silken walls sighed with the desert's secrets" and "stones grinding in rhythmic patterns, as if awakening from eons of sleep" show vivid imagery. However, several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("fragile whispers of enlightenment," "echoes of ancient wisdom"), and some repetitive structures appear ("Elar knew," "Elar stepped," "Elar had sensed"). The prose occasionally tells what could be shown, particularly around the prophet's influence.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=4.2)
    Extensive repetition weakens momentum: "as vines climbed" appears six times, "perceptively calm" three times, and multiple paraphrase loops occur ("piecing together fragments of the past" followed immediately by similar restatement). The phrase "transmute/transmuting/transmuted" appears four times. Template cadence dominates with "She [verb]" constructions, and abstract descriptors ("quiet magic," "earnest whimsy") replace concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("suspended hush enveloped the room—a profound silence hanging in the air, unbroken yet pregnant with unspoken echoes"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "suspended hush" concept restated multiple times, "weathered innocence" repeated without evolution. Template cadence emerges in the parallel "A snippet... followed by... then a jump to" structure. Information density is moderate but could be tightened by removing scaffolding phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("chalk crumbling in his hand, as the sounds of time enveloped him like an old, familiar sea") but suffers from abstract phrasing ("tidal longing," "vaporous illusions") and some paraphrase loops ("visions flashed bright, then faded into oblivion, leaving him clinging to echoes" restates the forgetting). Filter verbs cluster in places ("he believed," "Elias's heart swelled") dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("moon hung like a perpetual lantern") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently in peak beats. Template cadence appears in "Elias felt... Elias knew... He pondered..." sequence. Abstract phrasing like "luminous ache" and "ephemeral harnessed" creates some opacity, though the final image lands clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in descriptive passages ("radiant haven," "eternal dawn") and occasional redundancy ("pulsing stillness" appears three times). Template phrasing in places ("She was the serene music therapist") but momentum maintains through key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves clarity but suffers from ornamental density—"ethereal hush of the nocturnal observatory perched on a floating isle" front-loads description. Some paraphrase loops appear: "sealed awakenings—dormant forces bound in eternal slumber" restates the same concept. The writing is competent but occasionally overwrought, particularly in establishing passages.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from overwrought figurative language ("twilight years," "half-remembered dream," "fractured past") and repetitive abstract phrasing around transformation and forgiveness. The bone-setting method gets explained twice in similar terms. Several sentences could be cut without loss, particularly the philosophical abstractions about "innovating old pains into new purpose."

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.8)
    "Memories resurfaced" appears five times, creating both pattern and redundancy. Several passages loop concepts ("light without fire" variations, multiple phrasings of redemption). Purple patches like "zephyr's caress" and "languid curls" slow momentum. The prose achieves moments of clarity but accumulates enough ornamental language to dull impact, particularly in the middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.2)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("moss cushioning their vulnerability like a protective veil"). However, abstract phrases like "honeyed hush" and "protected vulnerability" appear without earning their weight through concrete action. Some redundancy in describing the garden's transformation could be trimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structure, but suffers from overwriting in places ("swirling hush" appears 4 times, creating template cadence). Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("vines of possibility snarled with thorns of regret" strains coherence). Information density is high but some passages lean toward purple prose without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose suffers from occasional overwriting ("fat and orange moon," "ethereal gold") and template descriptive patterns in the opening. Several paraphrase loops appear ("gathering hush" used three times, conceptual redundancy around sacred practices). Information density is uneven—strong during the ritual sequence but padded in exposition. The line "everything aligns" appears verbatim three times, creating unnecessary repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum through the ritual sequence, but several overwrought phrases strain clarity: "frost-cloaked apple trees twisted like forgotten promises," "celestial fury," "diluting touch of daylight." The sentence "She believed that the rhythms of life...could be charted like constellations" contains unnecessary scaffolding that could be shown through action.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("where veins of white stone twisted like frozen rivers") but suffers from abstract loops and overwriting. Phrases like "fragments of awe, tucking them away in logical constructs" and "ensuring that even in the quiet wounds of life" create density without advancing pressure—figurative language appears in most sentences without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "fingers spun patterns that repeated infinitely, each loop birthing smaller echoes." Several paraphrase loops appear, notably "boundary-lessly trapped"/"endless recursion" and the repeated explanation of calcification mechanics. Template cadence emerges in "She [verb]" constructions across multiple paragraphs, dulling momentum in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments like "rain jeweled the skylight like tears frozen in descent" but suffers from repetitive structures ("She carved," "She picked up," "She placed"). The "here and gone" phrase appears six times, straining through overuse. Some abstract passages like "crystallized time—moments captured and held, immutable as amber" lean purple without advancing action.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from density issues—figurative language appears in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in fragment collection sequence ("Another fragment drifted by...Elara collected it greedily"). The paraphrase loop of "ambitions erode/eroded" recurs without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose demonstrates solid craft with varied sentence structures and purposeful technical vocabulary. However, abstract phrases like "equations for hope" and "maze of intentions" appear repeatedly without concrete grounding, creating conceptual loops. The phrase "stoic wonder" appears twice verbatim, and some passages rely on telling ("This resurrection wasn't mere repair") rather than letting the image work alone.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant overwriting issues pervade the text with mixed metaphors ("crystals humming" then "whispering" then "recounting"), excessive modifiers ("excruciatingly gentle" appears four times), and purple constructions ("mist-shrouded mountains, where echoes dared not tread"). Template cadence appears in repetitive "He [verb]" constructions. The prose often tells what could be shown, particularly in the extended reflection passages about his past.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.7)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm shifts between reflection and action. However, several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("architecture of lies" appears multiple times, "serene upheaval" repeats), and some sentences lean heavily on modifiers rather than strong verbs. The diving sequence achieves good momentum but surrounding passages occasionally drift into contemplative loops.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty: "fusing sand into translucent wonder." However, repetitive structures appear ("He believed," "He pulled," "He worked") and some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("testament to life's quiet persistence"). The "oceanic hush" motif integrates well but "infinitely patient" appears as label rather than embodied trait in places.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("forsaken cathedral," "captured starlight") and some abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("geography of healing" repeated without concrete grounding). No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=5.2)
    Prose artifacts significantly impact momentum: "hypothesized/hypothesizing" appears 9 times, creating template cadence; multiple instances of "bitterly sweet" feel forced; runs of similar sentence structures ("He [verb]ed") appear throughout. The writing achieves moments of beauty but overwriting and repetitive stems prevent clean propulsion, particularly in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of overwriting diminish momentum: "bruised sky," "serene indifference," "forgotten stars." The phrase "gracefully alert" appears three times, creating unnecessary repetition, and some sentences prioritize lyricism over clarity ("the kelp's drift" construction feels forced).

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variety and information density, particularly in descriptive passages. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "defiant hush" repeats four times, creating template cadence; extended metaphorical explanations ("sidereal patience, the kind that mirrored the stars' slow, unyielding orbit—vast, eternal, unmoved by haste") slow momentum. The breadcrumb description contains unnecessary hedging ("perhaps remnants of ancient rituals").

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwriting pervades with dense figurative language ("stars bloomed like eternal flowers," "shimmering veil of memories woven from forgotten galaxies") that slows momentum. Template cadence appears in "She had existed... She sought to guide... She could not fly," and abstract loops recur ("generational patterns," "cycles of birth, bloom, and wilt," "repeating cycles").

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("butterflies, their wings a silent storm of orange and black") but suffers from repetitive phrasing—"thundering calm" appears three times, "fiercely meditative" twice. Several abstract constructions ("elusive form he believed hid in the world's shared sorrows") could be more concrete. The elevated register sometimes obscures rather than clarifies, particularly in philosophical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variety and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is generally high, though some metaphorical excess appears ("scorching waves," "fire in his mind"). The phrase "searing reverie" repeats four times, creating intentional pattern but risking oversaturation. Line "Heat miraged off the obsidian" shows strong verb choice.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    Overwriting appears in phrases like "velveteen gloom's retreat" and "tender shape of forgotten intentions." Multiple paraphrase loops occur ("uncharted echoes"/"uncharted realms," "tenderly organized" repeated twice). The prose achieves atmospheric density but sacrifices momentum to ornamental language.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structure and appropriate rhythm. Some overwriting appears in metaphorical density ("pregnant pause where potential hummed") and occasional redundancy ("vast, unyielding page, blank and waiting"). The line "seeding innovation within this very constraint" contains awkward phrasing that disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    Several repetitive phrases weaken momentum: "shortwave radio dial glow" appears verbatim three times, "thistled calm" twice, "secretly luminous" three times. The phrase "elusive song lyrics" recurs without variation. These loops create template cadence that dulls immediacy, particularly in the middle third where broadcast descriptions become redundant.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose shows strong moments ("charcoal lines blur and bind, transforming the fragile sketch") but suffers from abstract descriptors ("somber marvel," "mirage of safety") and repetitive phrasing around the gallery's illusions. The filter-verb stack in paragraph 14 ("he had listened," "he had assured") dulls immediacy during a key backstory section.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Layer by layer, he uncovered fragments"), but repetitive structures appear ("Elias agonized," "he agonized," "Elias agonized anew"). Some overwriting in metaphors ("receding tide," "dull blade," "sedimentary epochs") creates occasional density excess without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=5.7)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, but suffers from abstract phrasing ("traveled stillness," "fraught timeframe") and repetitive constructions around the required elements. The "subtracting noise" metaphor gets restated rather than dramatized, creating mild paraphrase loops that dull momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose has moments of vivid imagery but suffers from overwriting in peak beats - nearly every sentence contains figurative language. Template cadence appears ("He had planted...He approached...He selected"). Mixed metaphors clash (greenhouse as skeleton/phoenix/sanctuary). Information density is uneven with some paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density with phrases like "her lantern flickering like a trapped firefly" and maintains the honey/nectar motif throughout. However, several passages slide into pure exposition ("vast chambers buzzing with bio-luminescent drones, their wings sparking with captured bolts") and the riddle's interpretation feels mechanically explained rather than discovered. Some filter-heavy constructions ("she felt the weight") dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("spring unfurled like a secret whispered among the willows") but suffers from overwriting in places. Phrases like "inadvertently profound" and "sanctify the space" feel forced, and the density of figurative language occasionally obscures clarity without pattern-teaching payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "cascading revelations" and overuse of "threading" metaphors. Several instances of elevated diction ("immutable fact," "incisively kind") create register drift. Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple story elements, but filter constructions like "she realized" and "Elara glanced down" accumulate to dull immediacy in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=4.2)
    Severe template cadence issues: "Elias began...He sketched...His grim optimism fueled...he felt...he realized...he incorporated..." creates mechanical rhythm. Abstract telling dominates ("grim optimist" appears three times as label). Paraphrase loops evident: "perpetual motion" concept explained redundantly across multiple paragraphs. Filter-verb stack in peak moment dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=6.7)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from abstract phrasing ("rousing faint echoes from the ether," "awakening from a deep slumber") and occasional redundancy. Information density is uneven—some sentences merely restate rather than advance, particularly in the middle section describing the languages without showing their specific properties.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=6.6)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("rosewater masking the dread of encroaching decay") and information density, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("shadowed embrace," "thunderous veil") and abstract phrasing ("fragile threads of culture unraveling"). The "history's gentle hand" in the final line weakens what could be a purely image-driven closure. Syntax varies appropriately, and the piece maintains momentum despite some elevated diction that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several instances of overwriting weaken momentum: "jagged shores of a forgotten rocky island" and "shadows that twisted time itself" pile modifiers unnecessarily. Template constructions appear ("He pried it free," "He unwound the string," "He aligned the runes") creating repetitive stems. However, key passages like the hunger stone revelation maintain clarity and the closure image avoids these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from overwriting in places ("repulsive allure," "inexplicable invitation," "grotesque, alluring shapes") and template structures ("Elias nodded," "Elias frowned," "Trembling, Elias began"). The metaphor density in high-pressure beats ("silk over rusted blades," "spoiled milk") occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. However, several instances of elevated diction create occasional opacity ("fractaled whorls," "sketched resonance"). Some repetitive structures around "fractal" and mild redundancy in describing the harmonic effects. The phrase "euphony" appears three times, creating a minor loop.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong imagery. Information density is high without feeling rushed. However, some passages lean toward overwriting ("silent watchers on the horizon—towering, shadowy figures that never moved, yet seemed to observe") and occasional template phrasing appears ("trembling hands," "breath caught"). The scroll section summarizes rather than dramatizes key revelations.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=5.4)
    Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "noble lies—deceptions crafted for the greater good" immediately restates; "wilted and spent" is redundant; "marking the end of one chapter and the imperative start of his" doubles the same idea. The prose also suffers from abstract elevation ("foster a society wary of well-intentioned falsehoods") and template phrases ("heart ached with the weight") that dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments—"waves now claimed what land once held," "wrestling against the suction of mud and water"—but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing too frequently without pattern-teaching ("hushed blaze," "shadowed blood," "possessive spirits" in quick succession). Some template phrasing emerges ("With care, he..." "Gritting his teeth...") and the metaphor "heart a hushed blaze mirroring the sea's restrained power" strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=5.8)
    Prose suffers from repetitive constructions ("She readjusted," appears twice; "dappled" used three times) and occasional purple patches ("perpetual twilight of the ocean floor"). Template cadence appears in sequences like "She had come here motivated to trace honest origins" followed by explanatory clauses. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance plot or atmosphere, but phrases like "ensuring every page found its rightful place" could be cut without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Information density is moderate—most lines advance atmosphere or emotion. However, several instances of overwriting ("ethereal heights of the floating island tea garden"), redundant modifiers ("delicate lanterns," "fragile hope"), and the repetitive "luminous" create drag. The template phrase "Crafty as ever, Elias" and similar constructions feel formulaic.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "unused potential pools"/"hidden reservoirs"/"pools of unused potential" recycle across paragraphs. Template cadence in middle section ("Amir's eyes widened...Amir's heart pounded"). Mixed metaphor of potential as both "whisper made solid" and "quantum foam" creates slight confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=5.8)
    Significant template cadence issues: "Elara's perpetual surprise" appears four times, "brilliant dimness" three times. Paraphrase loops evident in lines 21-22 where the missing pieces concept restates. The prose achieves moments of beauty but suffers from repetitive stems and occasional purple patches ("cosmic debris like buried treasures").

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose tends toward overwriting with dense figurative language ("relentless shadow," "tempered echo," "sieved hush") that occasionally obscures clarity. Template cadence appears in parallel structures ("He had manufactured... That lie had quelled..."). Information density is high but sometimes sacrifices momentum for atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from repetitive phrasing around "thoughtful/thoughtfulness" (appears 5+ times) and some template cadence in dialogue tags. Information density is generally good with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. The paraphrase loop between "untether himself from that failure" and similar recycling metaphors creates mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose suffers from repetitive phrasing ("regrets" appears 6 times, "flickering faith" 3 times) and overwrought metaphors that blur rather than clarify ("gravitating toward healing"). The utility pole counting sequence provides momentum, but passages like "heart and action finally syncing like a well-calibrated compass" strain the metaphor beyond usefulness.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("delicately robust" appears twice, "ethereal blues and greens"). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, but occasional abstraction ("labyrinth of choices hidden in the everyday") weakens momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=5.4)
    Prose maintains readability but suffers from overwriting—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without payoff ("time folded like petals," "bond forged in the cradle of stars"). Template fantasy phrases accumulate ("ancient secrets," "whispering winds"), and abstract descriptors ("cosmic intimacy" appears three times) replace concrete detail. The final paragraph's philosophical abstractions dull the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and rich imagery. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "choking beauty" repeats three times, creating a loop; metaphors occasionally strain ("the air hummed with the weight of unspoken regrets"); and some passages prioritize lyrical density over clarity. The filter verb "knowing" and "feeling" appear in emotional beats, dulling immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm, particularly in the photograph sequences. Information density is high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere. However, some template patterns emerge ("She selected one," "Lira glided," "Threads of light extended") and abstract descriptors like "ghostly resolve" and "ethereal" could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("lightning bugs danced free, their vibrant flickers merging with the celestial glow"). However, several instances of elevated diction feel overwrought ("celestial bodies performed the slow dance," "elongated shadows"). Some repetitive phrasing around "vibrant hush" and "texture of transformation," though these function as intentional motifs rather than loops.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.0)
    Prose flows adequately with varied sentence structure, though several instances of overwriting appear ("luminous fort at twilight, where walls once glowed with an ethereal light"). Information density could be higher—multiple sentences restate the revolutionary intent without adding pressure. The phrase "winking hush" appears twice verbatim, suggesting template repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagistic density with lines doing multiple jobs, but some passages lean heavily on abstract descriptors ("sacred patterns," "cosmic tapestry") without concrete anchoring. The ritual sequence gains propulsion through its mathematical progression, though phrases like "patterns bloomed in the air" and "gravitational whisper" risk purple prose without clearer physical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.1)
    Prose shows ambition with varied sentence structures and rich imagery. However, metaphor density overwhelms in places ("lightning danced like forbidden verses," "tempest of unspoken rage whirled") creating purple prose. Several paraphrase loops appear (vigil paused/resumed, masks slipping repeated). Information density suffers from ornamental description over concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.3)
    Prose shows deliberate rhythm variation and strong verb choices ("fractured," "whirring," "disarmed"). However, several paraphrase loops appear ("questions into destinations" concept restated multiple times) and some purple prose moments ("storm of thoughts restrained by scholarly poise"). The final paragraph contains unnecessary summary that could trust the dramatization.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=6.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("silver fractures across the debris") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing ("forge beauty from anarchy" appears twice verbatim). Several sentences could be tightened—"This was his method, sparked from those prison days: turning sorted knowledge into living rebellion" summarizes rather than embodying—though the final paragraph maintains strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("shadows danced on the arbor's vine walls") with varied sentence lengths creating rhythm, but suffers from occasional overwriting ("steely longing, a resolute ache") and abstract phrases ("inexorable pull of destiny"). The filter-verb stack in "He'd discovered... did he see... He studied" dulls immediacy in the crucial discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition of "luminous doubt" and "empirically whimsical" that creates textural accumulation. However, several overwrought constructions appear: "doubt luminous as the ridge's blossoms gnawed at her," "the library trembled, fruits ripening as if her words were sunlight." Some template phrasing emerges in the dream sequence transitions. Information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose achieves moments of genuine beauty, particularly in linking the bonsai practice to emotional processing. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "blue-tinged sorrow that colored his days like the sea meeting the sky" could be more concise. Some repetitive phrasing around "tides of remembrance" and template constructions like "he + verb" patterns in the middle section detract from momentum.


== Grader: DeepSeek V3.1 Reasoner ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lucid and propulsive with high information density. However, a minor figurative muddle appears in the climax: "preprocessing the greenhouse's reality" is a slightly overwrought metaphor that briefly clashes with the POV's established lexicon. This is a local artifact that slightly dulls the closure image but does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor deduction for occasional dense figurative language ("drifting resonance that echoed her fractured thoughts") which, while purposeful, slightly risks obscuring immediacy in a high-pressure beat. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and clarity. A minor deduction for slight figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "petals unfurling like secrets"), though it remains coherent and does not obscure closure. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "chased stillness" is repeated, creating a slight paraphrase loop. However, this does not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propelled, with strong information density. However, a repetitive pattern emerges with the phrase "gently persistent" (used 4 times) and "amplified quiet" (3 times), creating a slight template cadence that dulls peak beats. No major clarity issues, but the repetition prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lucid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor prose artifact appears in the peak beat: "revealing the truth: to heal, she must release it" uses declarative, diagnostic language that slightly disrupts the embodied immediacy. Otherwise, sentence-level rhythm and syntax expertly support the accumulative build-up and release.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic propulsion. A distinct prose artifact penalty is applied for repetitive use of "quaking" and "reverie" across multiple sentences, creating a minor template cadence that slightly dulls the closure's impact despite the overall high quality.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and highly figurative but maintains clarity and propulsion, avoiding loops or scaffolding. The rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with the tension. A minor deduction for occasional dense metaphor stacks, but they are largely purposeful and do not obscure the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush but generally precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor tendency toward ornate description appears in phrases like "veils of green and violet that sang to him like distant violins," which, while voice-motivated, slightly slows momentum. No loops or scaffold issues. Clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, a minor case of overwriting is present in phrases like "a relic she'd acquired from a midnight market in exchange for a stolen dawn-lit sketch," which could be more concise. This slightly dulls the momentum but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is highly dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs simultaneously. However, a few mixed metaphors slightly muddle clarity ("weighty lightness," "gravity of loss danced with fleeting joy"). These minor artifacts do not touch the closure beat but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.4)
    Generally high information density and propulsion, but some figurative language clusters in high-pressure beats (e.g., "stars mocking his dizziness") create minor density issues. No loops or scaffold artifacts affecting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and purposeful, with high information density. The rhythm is controlled and varies effectively. A minor deduction for occasional risk of figurative overload (e.g., "like impatient specters" following several other similes) which slightly muddles clarity in a peak beat. However, the closure image remains crystal clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. There is a minor tendency toward slightly abstract phrasing in the peak beat ("amalgamation of experiences, born from loops that made the ordinary profound"), which prevents a higher score. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellent, with no loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is largely elegant and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. However, there is a tendency toward slight overwriting in peak beats, with stacked modifiers ("quiet sorrow," "crowded hall") and a few abstract nouns ("transparency," "honesty") that create minor density without advancing pressure. The sentence "The act was honesty incarnate" is a register drift that summarizes a dramatized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and variation, though minor overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., "twisted like forgotten promises" and "clung like desperate lovers" in close succession). Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple jobs. There are no significant loops or scaffolds, but a slight figurative density in the opening prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language like "twilight bled into the sky" is effective and purposeful. A minor instance of potential synonym churn exists ("subdued awakenings" echoed frequently), but it does not obscure clarity or harm the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished, with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("strings that filled the grand opera house with symphonies of longing") is consistent and purposeful. A single minor artifact: the phrase "lately inspired" is used twice, creating a slight echo, though it serves as a framing device.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward poetic density creates minor figurative muddle in high-pressure beats, such as "auroral sorrow" and "swaying certainties" appearing in close succession, slightly obscuring immediacy. The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop ("drowsy alertness" repeated) and a slight template cadence in describing the valve wheel, but these do not obscure closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, rhythmic control, and zero artifacts that obscure cause/effect. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, supporting the atmosphere without muddle. One minor paraphrase loop ("drift of untold seasons" repeated) is a hairline slip.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor overwriting: "cautious exuberance" is repeated, and some phrases verge on decorative ("hush of dreaming roots" appears multiple times). Rhythm remains strong, and closure is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery ("pages yellowed like autumn leaves"). Minor overwriting appears in phrases like "sensitively perceptive nature," which slightly dulls immediacy. Information density is high, and the final image lands with clarity and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, specific imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward summary in the resolution paragraph ("The mayor confessed...") and one potentially mixed metaphor ("sea crashing below like an impatient audience").

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a slight template cadence in the description of the palette and a hint of synonym churn ("muffled clarity," "unraveled stillness"). These do not harm closure but create a minor, localized textural loop.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a subtle template cadence in the memory-mapping sequence ("He recalled the first...", "Next came..."), though it serves a clear accumulative function. No loops or scaffold obscure closure; the final image is clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, but occasional overwriting ("fractured timelines that splinter reality like shattered glass") creates minor figurative muddle. No loops or scaffolding; sentence-level propulsion is strong, especially in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is occasionally over-dense, creating minor momentum drag in peaks (e.g., "filament of hush" metaphors stack). Information density is high, and every sentence advances character or atmosphere. The final line is a powerful, resonant image that recharges the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and varied sentence structures that propel momentum. Figurative language, such as "storms that defied physics, twisting reality into knots," is purposeful and clear. There are no loops, scaffold, or artifacts; every sentence advances character or atmosphere. The final line resonates with rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is pattern-taught and supports closure, but minor overwriting occurs in peak beats ("symphony of revival and loss"). No loops or scaffolding artifacts obscure causality. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates toward the climax effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though some metaphors ("time like clay") verge on conventional. A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "uncovering layers" and "patterned the rope," but it does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is a single, minor instance of potential overwriting ("like veins in a glass heart" following a strong metaphor), but it does not harm clarity or momentum. The prose is otherwise flawless and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor deduction for a slight artifact: "gentle fusion" in the climax feels like a near-synonym loop that slightly abstracts the embodied cost of the transformation. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight synonym churn ("cautious exuberance" is used twice, "whimsical attentiveness/attentive" twice) and a mildly mixed metaphor ("fireflies like tiny negotiators" slightly clashes with the serene tone). These do not harm closure but are noticeable.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and variety. Some minor scaffold in repeated phrases ("luminescent ache," "webs of kinship") and a few mixed metaphors (e.g., "fruits... dangled like forgotten stars" slightly strains logic). Clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied sentence structure. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and syntax accelerates with scene needs without becoming sluggish.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished, with excellent rhythm, concision, and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("tiny architect sculpting the stone"). No significant loops, scaffolds, or register drift. A single minor instance of potential telling ("His life was one of gentle invention") is strategic compression, not summary of a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language ("sapphire hush," "ethereal veils") is pattern-taught and pays off, enhancing atmosphere without becoming ornamental. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful, with rhythm accelerating through the memory sequence. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and concise with good rhythm, though minor scaffold appears in phrases like "reluctant and unwelcome" and "reluctant and unbidden," creating slight repetition. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. Information density is high, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, but suffers from mild figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "endless canvases of memory," "threshing raw meaning"). This creates a minor, non-closure-harming artifact that prevents a higher score despite strong rhythm and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor figurative pile-up occurs near the climax ("like ink bleeding into water" following other metaphors), creating a slight coherence muddle. Rhythm and sentence variety otherwise support the accumulative pressure effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with high information density—e.g., "fragments of stories, memories, and losses preserved in salty droplets" advances multiple layers. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during visionary moments. Minor artifact: slight register elevation in "reactively visionary" feels slightly diagnostic, but it is quickly dramatized. No loops or scaffold issues; clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. Minor deduction for adjective density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "ethereal relic," "analytically artistic masterpiece") which slightly blurs sense. However, there are no synonym loops or scaffold sentences, and clarity at closure is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures supporting emotional beats. Information density is high, though slight redundancy occurs ("entangled memories" repeated). No critical artifacts; figurative language ("unheard symphony") is pattern-taught and enhances closure.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and dense, with high information density and varied sentence structures that create a compelling rhythm. However, figurative language is pervasive, approaching overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "spatial mutiny—a rebellion of spaces folding against their natural order"), which slightly obscures clarity without full pattern-teaching. A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "hushed thunder" repeated three times, though it functions as a motif. The closure image remains clear despite these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language is consistently effective and voice-motivated. A minor instance of synonym churn ("liquefied rigid thinking... softening the stubborn barriers") appears but does not harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "prismatic whispers" slightly muddles the concrete image of light refracting). However, every sentence advances atmosphere or character, and there are no loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but figurative language occasionally stacks ("veils of what-ifs and half-remembered echoes") creating minor momentum drag. No critical artifacts obscure closure, and rhythm supports the accumulative mode. A single paraphrase loop noted ("histories erased" appears twice nearby).

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a tendency toward repetitive sentence structures in descriptive passages and a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives, which creates a faint template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. However, minor artifacts appear, including a tendency toward summary phrasing (e.g., "hopeful desperation") and some synonymous descriptors. The rhythm is occasionally hampered by longer sentences, but clarity and momentum are maintained, especially in key beats.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "melancholy swelled within her, a poignant sorrow") and a near-paraphrase loop between "precious essence" and "digital memory." These do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly sensory, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in the initial atmospheric setup (e.g., "mist weaving through rusted beams") which, while beautiful, slows the initial momentum. The closure sequence, however, is propulsive and clear, with no artifacts obscuring the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and largely effective, but occasional overwriting ("a rusted speck by the lake") and a complex sentence structure create minor drag on momentum. No major artifacts, but the figurative language is sometimes over-stacked, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph, but it remains purposeful and does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative overload and near-paraphrase loops appear in the climax (e.g., "ephemeral," "transience," "hush"), slightly dulling the closure's impact. Information density is high, and sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though it occasionally flirts with overwriting in peak beats ("copperlight repose of a fading sunset"). A minor template cadence occurs with "chase hush" repetitions, but clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closure image is undimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include some ornamental phrasing ("mournful elation," "lovingly venomous" are repeated) and a tendency toward stacked modifiers, but these do not obscure closure. Information density is high, and momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly evocative, with strong rhythmic control. There is a tendency toward density and occasional overwriting (e.g., "orchid solace—a gentle, floral hush..."). However, the language remains purposeful and advances the story's atmosphere and themes. No major artifacts obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence rhythms. Minor scaffold phrases ("a mix of trepidation and a warmly curious spark") appear but do not obscure closure. Figurative language is consistent and enhances atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor deduction for slight figurative density in a few lines (e.g., "echoing like forgotten whispers"), which, while beautiful, edges toward ornamentation in an otherwise lean, purposeful narrative. No loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is consistent and voice-motivated, though occasional phrases like "echoed silence" verge on repetition. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density with clear propulsion. Figurative language purposeful and pattern-taught. No loops or scaffold artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs ("With a sob, she evoked the core of it"). Peak beats maintain clarity without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor artifact penalty is applied for a cluster of dense figurative language in the opening paragraph ("whispered secrets," "pacific conflict-zone," "shrewdly innocent eyes") which, while taught, creates a slight momentum drag before the scene's action engages fully.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variation and information density. Most sentences pull double duty advancing both atmosphere and character. A minor deduction for a potential overload of figurative language in a single beat ("rippling like exposed film suddenly developed by an invisible hand"), which slightly risks coherence, though it ultimately serves the story's poetic logic.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and syntactic variety. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. A minor artifact: the phrase "methodically playful" is repeated, though it functions as a trait anchor. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent, particularly in the description of the symphony of reflected sound.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong with good rhythm and vivid imagery, successfully building atmosphere. However, it trends toward overwriting in several beats, with a high density of figurative language that occasionally strains coherence (e.g., "vines twisted like neural pathways," "sirens wailing like taxed screams"). This creates minor artifacts that slightly dull the clarity of peak moments without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly poetic, with strong rhythmic control. However, it flirts with overwriting; figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats, creating a density that slightly obscures immediacy and momentum, though clarity at closure remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation and high information density. However, a pattern of decorative, compound metaphors ("vein of regret," "stars fallen from the sky") appears in high-pressure beats. While often beautiful, this creates a slight density that, at times, prioritizes texture over propulsion, marginally slowing the climactic moment of lighting the core.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "melodies intertwining like vines") and a filter-verb stack ("Elara knew," "He saw") that slightly dulls the peak revelation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a tendency toward slightly over-written phrasing ("slyly heartfelt curiosity") and a cluster of compound adjectives in the discovery beat, which creates a mild density spike without fully obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though the concentration of floral metaphors ("blooming," "withering," "dried petals") in the first third creates a slight pattern that feels slightly over-applied before the story fully earns it. This is a hairline slip that does not touch closure or obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lush and often beautiful, but suffers from minor overwriting and a lack of concision that slightly dulls momentum. Figurative language is dense ("drifting prism terrace," "fractured hush") and occasionally repetitive, creating a textural haze. While generally clear, the syntax lacks the sharp propulsion needed for a top score, and some phrases feel ornamental rather than advancing sense.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but generally purposeful, with high information density. Rhythm varies effectively, accelerating into the ritual. Minor artifact: a slight synonym churn near the climax ("luminous respite... glowing tranquility... misty luminescence") and the phrase "shadowseam wonder" feels slightly over-engineered. However, clarity and propulsion are maintained, and closure is unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density with purposeful figurative language. Rhythm varies naturally, though occasional stacked modifiers ("iridescent cave nestled within a colossal crystal geode") create mild density without obscuring clarity. No loops or scaffold; propulsion remains strong through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "whirlwind of orchestrated whimsy") and a few instances of similar sentence stems, though these do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush, rhythmic, and highly evocative, with excellent information density. However, it flirts with overwriting in high-pressure beats; a cluster of figurative language in the climax ("Feathers of ethereal light... not of bird, but of nebula") creates a slight density artifact that marginally dulls the immediacy of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. A minor deduction for figurative language density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "noctilucent reckonings... lingering into dawn like clouds that shine after dark") which slightly obscures immediacy without teaching a pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely strong with vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor artifacting occurs in peak beats, such as the slightly elevated "verses of resilience" which feels tonally jarring against the otherwise concrete, embodied diction of the narrator's voice, creating a small register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and largely precise, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("serene upheaval") and a few instances of near-paraphrase, but these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in "The sensitively perceptive cartographer felt..." and some near-synonym churn ("uncharted passages" / "hidden architectures"). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly figurative, but purposefully so, matching the ethereal concept. While dense, it maintains propulsion and clarity, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The prism parapet caught the last rays, splintering them into spectra that danced across his illusions"). A minor tendency toward synonym-like description ("dusky harmony") prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and rhythmic, but suffers from mild overwriting: "flawed beauty" appears thrice, and "celestial dance" is redundant. A synonym loop occurs with "languid waltz" and "ponderous ballet" for the same phenomenon. These artifacts are minor but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; the repetition of "fractured grace" (3x) and "lull" (3x) trends toward decorative pattern rather than purposeful payoff. While the metaphors are generally coherent, this density slightly obscures the crispness of the causal action in the climax, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic but occasionally over-written, with stacked metaphors in high-pressure beats ("whispers and dances," "verse etched into the snow") that slightly obscure clarity without full muddle. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and polished, with varied rhythm and clear propulsion. Minor overwriting ("fractured patterns on the concrete floor") is offset by strong information density and absence of loops or artifacts. Figurative language supports clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with high information density. However, figurative language risks density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "blushing stillness" reapplying to realization), creating minor coherence strain. The closure image remains clear and potent despite this.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally exquisite with high information density, though slight overwriting appears in peak beats like "snowmelt ardor infused her actions" which feels slightly redundant. Rhythm and sentence variety support the accumulative progression effectively, with clear propulsion toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is occasionally over-stacked in high-pressure beats (“foresight that came only through hindsight,” “every scar a map to untraveled roads”), creating minor coherence muddles that slightly obscure closure clarity. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but occasional overwriting and synonym churn ("dusky harmony," "empirically ironic") create minor artifacts. The closure beat remains clear, and rhythm supports the accumulative pressure, though it sometimes slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: the term "cellular memory" introduces a slight register drift in an otherwise embodied context, creating a small clarity dip in a peak beat. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with high density and minimal scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric but maintains propulsion and clarity. Figurative language is consistent and pattern-taught ("veil of frozen diamonds," "labyrinth of glass-like fragility"). A minor rhythm issue exists in a long sentence describing the ritual's effect, creating a slight drag, but it does not obscure closure. Information density is high, with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, some phrases verge on decorative ("grief-fogged mind," "verdant labyrinth") and a minor synonym churn appears ("persistent growth," "persisted"). The rhythm is controlled, and the closure image lands with clarity, though a hairline figurative muddle exists in "wisdom's favorite disguise."

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and controlled, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, a minor prose artifact exists: the phrase "simply complicated" is used as a label-like trait for the inheritance concept rather than being fully dramatized through action, creating a slight scaffold feel in its deployment.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is densely poetic and generally purposeful, though occasional phrases like "chronal dust" or "temporal rifts" edge toward genre convention. The closure beat remains clear, and the lyrical pattern is taught and maintained, but minor overwriting prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "In the womb's shadowed cradle, we danced as one, two sparks in a single flame" do multiple jobs, advancing character, theme, and plot. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or figurative muddles; every word feels necessary and purposeful, sustaining momentum to the powerful closure.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propelled with good rhythm. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("warmly methodical," "otherworldly hum") creates a subtle template cadence. The phrase "translating confusion into clarity" is repeated, creating a minor synonym loop. These do not obscure closure but slightly dilute the line-level precision in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting appears in a few stacked modifiers ("ethereal shadows that danced") and a near-paraphrase loop describing the bloom's expansion. However, these artifacts do not obscure causality or dull the potent closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density. Minor scaffold in repeated "thistle-blown hope" (-0.3), but no artifacts obscure closure. Syntax varies effectively, and momentum is maintained through concrete action. Read-aloud rhythm is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences describing shadow measurement, causing a slight deduction, but clarity at closure is unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. However, a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("pregnant with possibility") creates minor register drift. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts were found to obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but figurative language is dense in the opening beats, creating minor momentum drag. The line "silence bloomed, vast and uncharted" is a mixed metaphor. No loops or scaffolding, and the closure beat is clear and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished and evocative, with strong rhythmic control and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, setting, or plot. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for the repetitive use of the phrase "sprout" in close succession during the collection beats, creating a slight template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and zero artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language ("crystalline platforms floated like shards of captured rainbow") is consistent, taught, and pays off. Sentence-level propulsion and rhythmic control are masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly descriptive, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting in high-pressure beats, with stacked modifiers and complex metaphors that can slightly obscure immediate clarity (e.g., "a cascading veil of prismatic energy, refracting light into infinite patterns"). This minor artifact prevents a higher score, though it does not break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("like ivy over a crumbling wall"). Sentence-level rhythm is varied and supports the emotional cadence, particularly in the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive. A -0.6 deduction is applied for moderate overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "shadowseam wonder enveloping her like a velvet cloak" during the dive). This creates a slight density issue but does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though slightly overwritten in peaks ("sanctuary of golden shadows"). Figurative language is mostly coherent and voice-motivated. Minor deduction for a near-paraphrase loop ("eloquently silent" / "unvoiced narratives"). No artifacts harm closure; sentence-level propulsion accelerates with the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythm and sensory detail. However, the phrase "shivering bliss" repeats four times, creating a template cadence artifact that dulls peak beats (-0.4 deduction). Information density is high, and sentences advance story and atmosphere effectively aside from this repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely. A minor instance of telling emotion ("Her heart, still raw from loss, quickened") slightly dulls immediacy but does not harm closure clarity. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language ("shimmering like molten gold") is purposeful and vivid. A minor instance of potential scaffold exists in "whispers of rebellion igniting," but it does not obscure causality or dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and vivid imagery. However, minor overwriting occurs, such as "quietly vivid" being used three times, creating a slight template cadence. A single paraphrase loop ("eerie nostalgia" appears four times) slightly dulls the otherwise precise language, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and highly descriptive, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally trends toward density, with figurative language stacking in high-pressure beats (e.g., "whirling leaves like delighted dancers"). This creates minor moments of opacity that slightly slow momentum, though clarity is never fully lost, especially at the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a template cadence ("He pushed... He knelt...") and a slightly mixed metaphor ("forgotten thunder"), but clarity at closure is unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density, though minor figurative stacking ("veins of gold in shattered porcelain," "luminous regret") creates slight density in high-pressure beats. No loops or scaffolding; sentence-level propulsion remains strong, and closure clarity is unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythm and varied syntax that supports the atmosphere. However, some figurative language ("luminous ache," "beauty laced with sorrow") borders on over-written in peak beats, creating a slight muddle. There is a minor paraphrase loop in describing the harp's purpose. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent, advancing the story effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor figurative overload occurs in the climax ("warm calculus"), creating a slight coherence muddle. However, rhythm and syntax are expertly controlled, and no loops or scaffolding artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, though occasional phrases verge on ornamental ("distilled dreams," "eternal instant"). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor figurative overload in the opening paragraph prevents a higher score, but it does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and propelled, with varied syntax. Minor artifacts: "weightless burden" leans slightly abstract, and "translucent fissures" may briefly muddy clarity. But no loops or scaffolds; figurative language generally serves closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density. However, figurative language stacks in high-pressure beats ("time folding in on itself, layers of eternity compressing") create slight opacity. No loops or scaffolding, but the density occasionally slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. However, minor figurative density and a tendency toward complex syntax in some sentences create occasional momentum drag, preventing a higher score despite the overall beauty.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythm. However, some sentences exhibit moderate density from stacked figurative language (e.g., "echoes danced like fireflies," "fate teetered like a scale"), which slightly slows momentum in the opening. No major loops or artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally clear and concise with high information density, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, with rhythm accelerating and breathing in step with the scene. A single minor synonym loop ("resonant hush" used twice in close succession) prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. A slight scaffold phrase ("turbine-hum reverie" appears twice) creates a minor loop, but it does not obscure closure or causality, and the overall propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally strong with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. However, a pattern of dense, metaphorical language appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "whisper of her quietly driven soul," "seasons blurred") which, while purposeful, occasionally creates a slight drag on momentum and clarity. The closure beat remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language ("reverie seared his senses," "burning hotter in his veins") creates minor momentum drag in high-pressure beats, preventing a top score.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Sentences are propulsive and dense, often doing multiple jobs ("the sea's rhythm matched his racing thoughts"). No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. A single minor rhythmic repetition ("conceive a new beginning... conceived a blueprint") prevents a perfect score, but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("velvet shroud," "silent accusations") is purposeful and coherent. A minor scaffold exists in the near-paraphrase of "velvet disquiet" but it is pattern-taught and pays off, not obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, but occasional overwriting creates minor momentum drag (e.g., "wild serenity—untamed energy wrapped in peaceful glow" verges on synonym churn). However, rhythm and syntax are masterfully controlled, and the closure beat remains clear and propulsive. No major artifacts harm causality.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lyrical and precise, with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor register drift in metaphors like "wind howled softly like a hushed prayer" slightly clashes with POV lexicon in a high-pressure beat. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. Clarity remains intact at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly lyrical with strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, though some overwriting occurs with stacked modifiers ("primal elegance of a starless void"). Information density is high, with lines often doing multiple jobs, such as describing setting while advancing character. A minor paraphrase loop exists in the description of vulnerability and stillness, but it does not measurably obscure cause/effect or dull the closure image. Figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and varied sentence rhythms. Read-aloud flow is strong. Minor overwriting in a few compounded metaphors ("shimmering like heat haze") and a slight template cadence in the description of the box's patterns create a small artifact, deducted here.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with high information density. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in peak beats (e.g., "texture of time halting") which creates a mild register drift and momentarily obscures clarity. The rhythm is otherwise well-controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final paragraph's cadence is masterful, resolving the image with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and vivid, with high information density. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Rhythm is controlled and varies appropriately, particularly in the closing paragraphs which achieve a lyrical cadence without sacrificing clarity. Read-aloud quality is high.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from moderate density issues; figurative language is stacked in high-pressure beats (e.g., "bronze statues whispering secrets," "bronze quiet") which slightly obscures clarity. A minor paraphrase loop occurs with "chemistry of homecoming" and "alchemy of bonds." Momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor register drift occurs in phrases like "submerged fury" and "verdant life," which feel slightly elevated against the otherwise grounded POV lexicon. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure, capped by the non-closure accumulation rule.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. However, a minor artifact penalty (-0.4) is applied for a cluster of dense figurative language in a high-pressure beat (e.g., "a frozen breath from a forest that whispered farewells," "closeness blooming like a preserved autumn unfurling"), which slightly slows momentum without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density with clear propulsion; no loops or scaffold. Figurative language is pattern-taught ("echoed silence") and pays off. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally with scene needs, avoiding template cadence. Minor register drift in "stellar tomb" is voice-motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is densely poetic with strong rhythmic control. Minor overwriting occurs in peak beats (e.g., "purples bleeding into impossible greens" risks slight abstraction). No loops or scaffold artifacts. The final image ("vanished into the mists") propels momentum cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with varied sentence structures amplifying momentum. Figurative language is mostly coherent, but slight overuse in peaks ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous threads") causes minor muddle without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: the repetition of "hidden thunder" creates a slight template cadence, and the phrase "substituted reality nightly" is a near-abstract nominalization. These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the peak beat. Information density is otherwise high, and every sentence advances the story.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., the labyrinth sharpens his mind *and* symbolizes his downfall). A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) is applied for a template cadence in the description of the tapestry's border ("threads unraveling like forgotten memories"), which slightly dulls an otherwise sharp image.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in the description of the spire ("a pale spire in mist, its surface smooth and ethereal") and a single instance of potential register drift ("multifaceted insights"). However, these do not harm closure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and vivid, with strong sensory selection ("hissed and spat," "molten lacquer"). Few artifacts: "conjure meaning" borders on thematic echo, and "fractured world" is slightly abstract. Momentum maintains through rhythmic variation and concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. A minor deduction for a potential register drift in the phrase "temporary eternity," which, while thematically relevant, momentarily elevates diction beyond the POV's typical lexicon. However, this is a hairline slip that does not harm closure clarity or propulsion. Information density is high, and the final line is particularly strong.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor deduction for the slightly mixed metaphor of "screaming tenderness," which creates a small figurative muddle in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative without artifice, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Minor risk of abstraction in phrases like "geography of loss," but clarity remains intact in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. However, minor artifacts exist: a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("wind-scoured," "unbearable torrents") and the repeated use of "fractured" creates a subtle template cadence. These do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is generally strong with vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deductions for slight overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "veiled in a perpetual mist that clung to everything with softly persistent fingers" could be tighter) and a template cadence in "Elias knelt... Elias checked... Elias pocketed..." which creates a minor rhythmic loop.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Figurative language (“petals unfurling like living stars”) is purposeful and consistent. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines (“empirically noting… intuitively sensing”), causing a slight paraphrase loop, but it does not obscure closure. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple elements.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. However, minor artifacts appear: a paraphrase loop ("softly commanding" is used three times) and some dense figurative language in peak beats ("liquid lace") that slightly muddles clarity without breaking it.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, but suffers from minor figurative overload in peak beats (e.g., "the portal swallowed her," "embers swirled like living stars"), applying a -0.6 deduction. Rhythm and sentence variety are strong, and information density is high, with most lines advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic with strong propulsion, though minor artifacts exist ("feral nostalgia gnawing at my edges" and "jaded wonder" verge on therapy-speak but are quickly dramatized). No loops or scaffold obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor artifact is present: the phrase "trembling calm" is repeated three times, creating a slight template cadence that slightly dulls its potency by the final use.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with high information density. However, minor artifacts exist: a template cadence in "The hush deepened, saturated..." and a slight register drift in "saturated hush" which feels slightly elevated for the POV. These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score. Rhythm and sentence variety are otherwise strong.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythmic control and sensory detail. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "notes clashing like old grudges") which, while effective, edges toward ornamentation. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptional with high information density and poetic precision. The prose is lush but purposeful, advancing atmosphere and theme. A minor deduction for occasional moments where the figurative language borders on over-density, though it never fully obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though it risks minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "the invisible boundaries that defined existence"). Rhythm is controlled and varies with scene needs. One minor scaffold phrase ("the familiar pull of his quest") but no major loops or artifacts that harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong information density. Some figurative language in high-pressure beats approaches density ("quiet wildfire" appears multiple times) without full pattern-teaching. No significant loops or scaffolding artifacts. Sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative design effectively, though occasional phrases like "grasping at echoes" verge on therapy-speak.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat: "clover melancholy—a bittersweet sorrow laced with faint, green-tinged hope" introduces a complex, slightly mixed metaphor that briefly slows momentum. Otherwise, craftsmanship is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied sentence structures and a read-aloud rhythm that supports the eerie atmosphere. Figurative language ("melodically haunted," "wheel of fate") is consistent and enhances clarity. No loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors. Information density is high, advancing story and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slightly mixed metaphor ("dark as forgotten dreams") which slightly muddles sense in a key beat. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with concision and momentum, and the closure image is clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery ("tracks swallowed by emerald tendrils"). A minor deduction for a few instances of slightly ornate phrasing ("achingly alone," "politic invaders excusing their overgrowth") that, while beautiful, momentarily draw attention to themselves.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. Read-aloud quality is strong, e.g., "etching contours of unseen landscapes onto parchment with fingers that danced like spiders on silk." A minor artifact exists: "uncharted emotional depths" and "veiled truths" are slightly synonymous, but this is a hairline slip that does not touch closure or obscure cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. However, a minor artifact exists: a cluster of figurative language in the high-pressure beat describing the pen drawing "probability from the air" creates a slight muddle, costing a small deduction for coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "joyful sorrow" risks abstraction) and a single instance of potential synonym churn ("quiet symphony"/"quietude"). Overall, clarity and propulsion are excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally dense and purposeful, advancing character and plot. However, some figurative language ("heart stirred with volcanic tenderness") feels slightly overwrought and risks cliché, creating minor artifacts that slightly dull the peak emotional beats. The sentence-level rhythm and propulsion are otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with strong rhythmic control that mirrors the act of drumming. There is a minor tendency toward decorative phrasing (e.g., "auroral sorrow," "cosmic sigh") that, while beautiful, occasionally borders on ornamentation without advancing sense in a high-pressure beat. However, the propulsion never stalls, and the closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is clean, concise, and highly evocative, with strong rhythm and varied sentence structures. Information density is high, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., the storm setting the scene and creating the central obstacle). There are no noticeable loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A single minor artifact: "geomagnetic storm" is repeated, but it's a key term and not excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong, with vivid, purposeful imagery and good rhythmic control. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor artifact penalty for the repetitive use of the “spiralingly calm” construction, which creates a slight template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid, with good rhythmic variation. However, some overwriting occurs ("the hush where past meets prophecy, that ethereal twilight..."), creating minor density issues. A template cadence is faintly detectable in some descriptive lists, but it does not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density, though a few phrases verge on ornamental ("grace of a current weaving through kelp"). No loops or scaffold artifacts. The final paragraph's cadence is masterful, landing the closure with clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly accomplished with vivid, purposeful imagery and strong rhythmic control. Sentences are dense and propulsive, often doing multiple jobs (e.g., "turning the simple whittling into a grand saga" advances character, theme, and action). A single, minor loop occurs in the repeated use of "lightness" and "void," but it is patterned and purposeful, not scaffolding. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric with strong rhythmic control. There is a minor tendency toward density in figurative language, but it remains coherent and largely serves the textural build. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. The final paragraph's cadence is particularly effective, landing the closure with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with no figurative muddle in peak beats. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with tension (e.g., "Horror gripped him"). No loops, scaffold, or artifactual phrasing. Grammar and punctuation are clean, supporting clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is generally strong with good rhythm and sensory detail. A minor penalty is applied for a slight density of figurative language in high-pressure beats, such as the description of the final epiphany, which borders on overwriting without fully obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. However, it exhibits minor decorative phrasing and a template cadence, particularly in the opening lines with parallel clauses ("where stars whispered secrets," "where time folded like parchment"). These artifacts are minor and do not obscure closure, but they prevent a higher score. The final paragraph's rhythm is excellent, creating a strong sense of cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive. Slight overwriting is present (e.g., "inherited mystery pulsed stronger"), creating a minor figurative density in a high-pressure beat. No loops or scaffolding artifacts harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with strong information density. Minor figurative overload in high-pressure beats ("a tapestry of anguished joy") slightly muddles clarity but does not break propulsion or obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but occasional ornate phrasing ("wisps of luminous sorrow") slightly inflates texture without advancing sense. A minor synonym churn exists around "softly deliberate," but it does not obscure closure. Sentence-level propulsion and read-aloud rhythm are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, a minor template cadence emerges in a short run of sentences starting with "He" ("He rose...", "He set...", "He began..."). There is also a slight paraphrase loop between "shedding layers" and "peeled them from the walls, layer by layer." These artifacts are minor and do not touch the closure, but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and vivid, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. Sentence-level rhythm varies naturally, supporting the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly dense and vivid, but this creates a minor figurative overload in high-pressure beats. Phrases like "hushed thunder" and "symphony of the heart" strain coherence slightly, though they do not break closure clarity. The rhythm is otherwise controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is lush and highly evocative, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally flirts with overwriting; the density of figurative language in some sentences ("casting shadowed rapture upon the archway— a tone of dark ecstasy") creates minor momentum drag, preventing a higher score despite the overall mastery.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language stacks in high-pressure beats ("wave functions danced like ethereal lullabies, probabilistic waves collapsing") creating a slight muddle. The closure image remains clear and potent, mitigating the penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor instance of elevated diction ("mechanical eden") slightly clashes with the POV's lexicon in the closure beat, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor, isolated artifact exists: the phrase "shoreline lullaby" repeats three times, creating a slight template cadence. However, this does not obscure causality or closure, and the overall line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for occasional dense figurative language ("seraphically mundane role") that, while voice-motivated, slightly slows momentum in a high-pressure beat. However, information density is high, and the final paragraphs achieve clear propulsion without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished and vivid, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacting appears as a tendency toward synonym churn and decorative phrasing ("elegant fallout," "timeless haze") which, while tonally consistent, slightly blunts the precision of the closure image without obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and purposeful, with high information density and varied sentence structure. Figurative language ("renewable whispers," "oceans rose in defiant swells") is consistent and enhances atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. Minor deduction for a slight "as" construction ("as rain pelted") but no loops, artifacts, or clarity issues in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, dense, and lyrical without becoming muddy. Figurative language ("skeletal guardians," "celestial tapestry") is consistent and effective. Sentence rhythm varies expertly to match the mood, accelerating into the vision sequence. A single, minor loop exists: "meaning in the mess" appears twice, but the reprise is purposeful and thus not penalized. No artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and good rhythmic control. Minor overwriting occurs in high-pressure beats (e.g., "bubbles popped like secrets surfacing"), creating a slight figurative density that doesn't obscure closure but slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm, clarity, and information density. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("symphony of blooms," "pearl of stillness"). A single, minor loop exists in the description of the photograph as both "crumpled" and "creased," but this is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "essences slipping away like smoke," "threads of light, tangled like a weaver's nightmare") which, while beautiful, creates a density that slightly slows momentum. No loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm, clarity, and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("serene anger," "fury that simmered... like a distant storm"). No significant loops, scaffolds, or artifacts were detected to obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a subtle pattern of repetitive sentence stems focusing on "dizzying quiet," which, while thematically relevant, creates a slight template cadence that slightly dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. One minor strain: "tranquil blaze" slightly mixes metaphors, though it is pattern-taught. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere without loops or scaffolding, and the closure image is clear.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, with excellent rhythmic control and variation. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "feral flowers," "feral lullaby" appearing close together), which, while beautiful, creates a mild pattern that slightly softens the climax's impact. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or clarity issues.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a slight density risk exists in the "orbits" metaphor cluster. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure clarity. Read-aloud rhythm is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, but this creates minor figurative muddle in high-pressure beats (e.g., "ghostly algorithms reaching out like invisible threads" followed by "chanting star patterns"). The rhythm is generally controlled, though the density occasionally slows momentum. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and vivid, with high information density. Rhythm is generally strong, though a pattern of "whispering" and "swirling" repetitions emerges, slightly dulling the closure image. There is no figurative muddle; metaphors are coherent and purposeful. A minor scaffold exists in the repeated sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, but suffers from minor density issues in high-pressure beats. Figurative language is occasionally stacked ("cradle empathy in arms of steel," "warm coldness"), creating a slight muddle. A template cadence appears in the list-like description of the closure effect ("shuddered, its circuits humming"). Momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax. However, a tendency toward overwriting is present, with stacked modifiers and figurative language that occasionally blurs sense (e.g., "synesthetic hues of sorrowful blues and bitter tangs"). This creates minor momentum drag in high-pressure beats, though it does not ultimately obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with strong information density. A minor figurative muddle occurs with "willowglass hope," a compound metaphor that is slightly strained and calls attention to itself. Otherwise, sentences advance story and character without significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with strong sentence-level propulsion. Figurative language is consistent and effective ("stalactites like frozen rain"). A minor instance of potential register drift ("factually mystical quality") is quickly grounded in concrete explanation, preventing obscurity. The closure image is clear and impactful, suffering no muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or artifacts; figurative language serves pattern-building ("constellations in the night"). Final image recharges motifs without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. However, a few phrases border on overwriting ("prudently daring to awaken," "accumulated snow in hesitant patches") creating minor density without payoff. These artifacts are slight and do not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and sensory density, though a minor mixed metaphor ("spindrift serenity" applied to a river) slightly muddles clarity. No loops or scaffolds; sentences advance story and atmosphere cohesively.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and information density. One minor mixed metaphor ("cracked earth stretched like forgotten pottery" slightly violates physical logic) prevents a higher score. Otherwise, no loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor figurative density appears in the climax ("light blooming softly like new roses") but does not obscure clarity. One instance of potential register drift ("wistfully pragmatic resolve") slightly dulls the peak beat's immediacy but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density ("brittle awakenings begin—the fragile resurgence of memories that could shatter like thin ice"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating with pressure. Minor overwriting in peak beats ("raw yolk of emotion" slightly strains metaphor), but no loops or scaffold artifacts. Closure image remains clear: "gleaming atomically, capturing the last glints of her transformed solitude."

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats (e.g., "secrets he guarded like fragile eggs") and a near-paraphrase loop between "weave" and "tapestry" in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on compound sentences and a near-paraphrase loop between "factions clashed" and "believers erecting altars... skeptics arming themselves," which slightly dulls momentum but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat: "spatial mutiny unfolded, dimensions twisting" slightly strains the metaphor. No loops or scaffold, but this artifact prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with a strong read-aloud rhythm. Figurative language ("furrowed hush," "lance the divide") is precise and impactful. There is a single minor instance of near-abstract language at the empathy awakening ("empathy awoke, no longer dormant"), but it does not significantly obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.2)
    Vivid, atmospheric prose with strong information density. Slight deduction for minor overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "spongey dread" is repeated, and some metaphors like "humidity-warped maps curled like dying leaves" are slightly overworked), but clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, minor overwriting occurs, with a high frequency of figurative language that sometimes risks coherence (e.g., "roads twisted like a forgotten melody"). No major loops or scaffolding artifacts were found, and momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely vivid and purposeful, though occasional phrases like "perceptively calm" verge on label-speak. A minor template cadence appears in describing the train's cars, but overall momentum and clarity are maintained, especially in the potent closure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously, without loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle. The read-aloud test reveals a natural, varied cadence that supports the story's contemplative yet urgent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. Minor artifact: repetitive use of "like" similes ("like a war drum," "like frozen steel," "like living catapults," "like a warrior") creates a faint template cadence, though it is voice-consistent and doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly lyrical with strong rhythmic control and information density. However, slight overwriting occurs with near-paraphrase loops (e.g., "anxious elation" repeated) and a cluster of abstract nouns in peak beats slightly mutes immediacy. The closure image remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with high information density. However, it occasionally trends toward overwriting; a cluster of mixed metaphors in high-pressure beats ("veins through forgotten flesh," "living chains") creates minor figurative muddle that slightly obscures causality without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("echoing like faded cheers"), which, while voice-motivated, borders on ornamentation in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. However, a pattern of stacked metaphors and slightly elevated diction appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "spectral weights," "perpetual transition"), creating minor artifactual clutter that slightly dulls the closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly evocative, though occasional phrases ("wintersun serenity") verge on slightly overwrought repetition. The sentence-level propulsion is excellent, with syntax and rhythm accelerating the ritual's cadence. A minor deduction for a hint of decorative flourish, but clarity and momentum are never obscured.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density, vivid sensory detail, and rhythmic control. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddles. Sentences advance character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously, particularly in the peak closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is concise and vivid with high information density; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm varies naturally. Minor deduction for a slight template cadence in "Rain drummed outside, ivy rustled..." but no loops or scaffold artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but purposeful, with high information density. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the accumulative design. A minor scaffold exists in adjacent sentences restating caution ("exuberance tempered by caution," "whispered reminders to herself"), causing a slight momentum drag. However, rhythm and syntax are generally strong and support the dreamlike tone.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for repetitive phrasing ("mulberry ache" appears three times) and a slight register drift in peak beats, where the poetic language occasionally borders on over-writing without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence openings and paragraph lengths. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off. Minor density issue: slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats ("liquid hush," "fractal beauty") without clarity loss.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery, but occasional overwriting appears, such as “vineyard hush” which feels slightly ornamental. There are minor scaffold phrases, but no loops or artifacts that harm closure. Information density is high, and momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent. A single minor loop exists ("sincerely insincere" appears twice), but it is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure. No artifacts in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is highly polished, with strong rhythmic control and vivid, precise imagery ("revelations budding slowly like flowers in dawn's hesitant light"). Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight over-reliance on the word "hush" (three times) and some abstract phrasing in peak beats (e.g., "weaving truth carefully"). However, these do not obscure causality or dull the closure. Information density is high, and every sentence advances atmosphere or character.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density, most lines advancing multiple jobs of story, character, and atmosphere. However, a minor instance of overwriting is detected in the phrase "a motivation born of necessity—to learn to navigate without moving," which contains a slight paraphrase loop. This artifact is confined to a single line and does not obscure closure clarity, but it prevents a higher score. Figurative language is generally coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is dense and propelled, with varied sentence structures and no artifacts. Figurative language serves the atmosphere without muddle. The final image is clear and resonant, with high information density. Read-aloud rhythm supports the story's emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly dense, often accomplishing multiple tasks. However, this density leads to minor figurative muddle in a few peak beats, applying a slight penalty. Rhythm is generally strong, and the closure lands with clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. Minor overwriting appears in phrases like "stellar doubt that whispered of eternal night" which leans slightly decorative, but it does not obscure closure. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and varied rhythm. However, a minor artifact penalty is applied for a pattern of stacked modifiers and slightly over-written figurative language in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "kaleidoscope of colors dancing"), which creates a momentary drag on propulsion without wholly obscuring clarity or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control in the ritual sequence. Minor decorative flourishes ("dawn's golden fingers") and a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("lukewarm," "earnestly naive") create occasional texture without muddying clarity. No significant loops or artifacts harm momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. There is no scaffold, looped phrasing, or figurative muddle. The final paragraph is a model of concision and resonant image-making. A single, hairline instance of potential synonym churn ("unbidden and sharp") prevents a perfect score, but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, but a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (“like forgotten dreams,” “like embers in a forge”) creates minor decorative weight without pattern payoff, preventing a 9+ score. Otherwise, rhythm and propulsion are masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Minor artifacts include a few repetitive stems (“soundless echo”) and a instance of near-paraphrase (“soundless echo” / “echoing void”). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the textural specificity in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive, with strong imagery ("swirling nebulae," "slicing through pretense like silk"). A minor loop exists in the repeated use of "numbness" as a label, but it's dramatized with embodied cost. Sentence rhythm varies effectively to match the meditative and action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with good rhythmic variation. Minor artifacts include a slight repetition of "storm-born silence" and "flow," and a register drift in phrases like "orthogonal approaches," which feels academic for the POV. These do not significantly harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is vivid and concise, with high information density (e.g., "leaf blower symphony conductor" encapsulates character). Rhythm varies naturally, though minor repetition of "mournfully eager" slightly dampens peak beats. No loops or scaffold; figurative language is consistent and purposeful. Read-aloud test passes with lyrical cadence supporting the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor tendency toward overwriting and slightly over-stacked metaphors ("shadowy amalgamation of fur and forgotten tomes") creates occasional, small drags on momentum. These artifacts are minor and do not touch the clarity of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is densely lyrical but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation that accelerates with the ritual's intensity. Minor overwriting occurs in phrases like "vivify not mere matter, but his own spirit," which slightly abstracts the stakes, but clarity remains intact. No loops or scaffold artifacts dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful description and good rhythm. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in high-pressure beats (e.g., "calm as a sleeping storm") which, while not muddying clarity, slightly softens the peak moment's impact against the story's practical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density, though occasional mixed metaphors slightly muddle clarity (e.g., "clocks... their hands twisting like vines in rebellion"). Momentum is maintained. No significant loops, scaffold, or artifacting. The final line is a strong, thematic image that recharges prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. No loops or scaffolding artifacts. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on compound-complex sentences in high-pressure beats, but clarity and momentum are never compromised, especially at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance character and atmosphere simultaneously. A minor instance of potential register elevation ("microcosm of potential infinity") is voice-motivated and does not clash with the POV's lexicon or harm closure clarity. No loops or artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and purposeful rhythm. However, a template cadence emerges in a cluster of sentences starting with "Elara" or "She" in the first third, and a single mixed metaphor ("swirled like forgotten breaths, amplifying the reeling hush") creates a slight muddle. These are minor artifacts that do not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor prose artifact appears in the climax with the slightly elevated, technical phrasing "phasing from solid ice to liquid flow to vaporous release," which creates a small stumble in an otherwise strong voice-motivated passage.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) is applied for a template cadence run in the description of the ink ("swirls, veins, and sigils that danced before evaporating") and a single instance of potential therapy-speak ("moments of grace"). These do not obscure closure but slightly dull the peak beat's texture.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with virtually no scaffolding or loops. Figurative language is consistent, pattern-taught, and serves the theme. A minor rhythm hiccup occurs in the climax ("Textures became sounds:...") with a slightly list-like structure, but it's a hairline slip that doesn't obscure closure. Read-aloud rhythm is otherwise superb.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is densely poetic and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor overwriting appears in peak beats (e.g., "bitterness alchemized into ironic joy" feels slightly summary-like). A single paraphrase loop exists ("bitterness festered"/"bitterness ebbed"). Overall, clarity and momentum are maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythmic variety and information density. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the high-pressure climax (e.g., "velvet thunder," "symphony of tarnished wonder"), which slightly mutes the visceral clarity of the action.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied sentence structures and no loops or scaffold. Figurative language ("brittle hush," "thunderstorm in a bottle") is consistent and enhances clarity. Read-aloud rhythm is strong, and syntax supports scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally lush but controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor overwriting occurs in stacked phrases like "misting hush" and "whispering gleam," but doesn't obscure closure. Information density remains high without sacrificing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor artifacts include a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "whispering like the islands themselves") and a near-paraphrase loop between "runaway dream" and "dissolved entirely into the ether," though clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. A minor synonym loop occurs with "enveloped secrets" and "secrets unfolding," and the phrase "cosmic possibility" is repeated. The rhythm is effectively varied, and the final line lands with resonance. No major artifacts obscure cause/effect or dull the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally crisp and vivid with strong momentum. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a synonym loop: "crisp nostalgia" appears twice, and "crisp chill" appears earlier, creating a slight template cadence. This does not obscure closure but slightly dulls the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in the opening line, which, while beautiful, slightly delays narrative momentum. Otherwise, sentences advance story and character effectively without loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, advancing story and atmosphere. Read-aloud rhythm is strong. A minor figurative density issue appears in the phrase "color of wonder," which leans slightly abstract, and a template cadence is faintly detectable in a few descriptive lists. These do not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a minor deduction for slight density in a high-pressure beat (e.g., "lucid unrest that sharpened her senses even as it unsettled her soul" risks being slightly stacked). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts that harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm is varied and propulsive, masterfully modulating to match the scene's quiet tension. There are zero loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; the writing is pristine and heightens the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is concise and propelled by varied syntax, with high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple elements. Minor figurative density appears in high-pressure beats ("quietly explosive") but does not obscure clarity. A single instance of near-paraphrase ("spooled wholeness" echoed) prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for figurative density in one high-pressure beat ("stacked like forgotten whispers," "whispers from a lost era," "mathematical poetry") which, while beautiful, creates a slight rhythmic pattern that slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "diligently curious" is used three times, creating a slight template cadence. However, this does not obscure cause/effect or dull the closure. The final line is a strong, resonant image that effectively concludes the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and highly textured with varied syntax and rhythm, though occasional phrases like "veins of forgotten rivers" border on ornamental. No loops or scaffolding artifacts harm momentum; figurative language remains coherent and serves the atmosphere, even if slightly overripe in spots.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control and vivid imagery ("vast groves of fruit trees stretched beneath skies pierced by floating rock arches"). Minor artifacts include occasional clichés ("ragtag group," "unbreakable bonds") and a slight over-reliance on adjective-noun pairs ("soft glows," "gentle rains"). These do not significantly impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic variation. Minor overwriting occurs in the peak beat ("bruised purple and gold, evoking an awe tinged with the pain of inevitable loss"), creating a slight figurative muddle. Otherwise, propulsion is maintained, and closure clarity is untouched.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is largely lush and controlled, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for occasional over-stacked modifiers ("raw, unpolished satisfaction") and a slight register drift in the final paragraph. However, the line-level craft effectively supports the story's atmosphere and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely elegant and purposeful, with strong information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a touch of overwriting in high-pressure beats, such as "symphonically minded brain discerning rhythms," which slightly risks abstraction. However, the language remains clear and generally serves to advance character and atmosphere without significant momentum loss or artifacting.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative strain exists ("mindfully scattered seeds") but does not obscure closure. There is a slight risk of overwriting in peak beats, but the language largely serves momentum and revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. There is a minor instance of metaphor stacking in the high-pressure beat ("complex broth needing refinement") following closely on "bitter spikes... milder notes," but it does not obscure clarity or causality at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful with good rhythm. However, some overwriting appears in high-pressure beats (e.g., "vigorous tender resolve," "vigorous tender hands"), creating minor register drift and a template cadence that slightly dulls the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and purposeful with strong rhythm, but occasional overwriting and a complex syntax create minor momentum drag in a few key beats, though clarity is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. Minor artifacts include a slight overuse of compound adjectives ("prism-minded," "clandestinely luminous") and a template cadence in the description of her mind "refracting the danger." These do not significantly obscure causality or dull the closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly textured but generally maintains clarity and momentum. There is a high degree of figurative language, but it is mostly coherent and pattern-taught by the voice. A minor deduction for a slight "scaffold" moment in the climax: "slow builds for the deep fractures, quick flutters for the fine lines" feels slightly explanatory within an otherwise embodied action. Rhythm and syntax are otherwise expertly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, though a cluster of three metaphors in the peak beat ("vein," "eclipse," "pawn") creates a slight density bump without muddling clarity. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, though occasionally overwrought ("theatrical sincerity" appears twice). Figurative language is pattern-taught and functional. Minor scaffold in adjacent descriptive lines ("shadowed workshop under stars" / "night air hung heavy"). No artifacts harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic, with strong information density. Some overwriting in peak beats (e.g., "olfactorily sensitive nose" is redundant). Minor template cadence in lists of abstract nouns ("power and peace," "fear of the encroaching storms to hopeful adaptation").

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("fruits detached from trees, floating like crimson bubbles"). No loops, scaffold, or artifacting detected. Sentence-level propulsion is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=9.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("skeletal frames of cranes") is sharp and coherent. No loops, scaffold, or mixed metaphors. The final paragraph's cadence shift ("forged anew in the quiet aftermath") lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is pattern-taught and coherent, serving the accumulative design (e.g., "sculpted hush," "auditory chisel"). Minor artifact: a slight register drift in "oscillating repose" feels academic but is quickly grounded in embodied emotion ("heart oscillated"). No loops or scaffolds obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a pattern of slightly overwrought compound adjectives ("avalanchingly quiet") in high-pressure beats, which creates a subtle figurative muddle without obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, poetic, and highly purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for figurative language appearing in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats, creating a slight risk of over-writing that slightly dulls the closure image's impact, though it remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. However, a minor instance of decorative phrasing slightly dulls momentum: "forgotten dreams across jagged peaks" is a somewhat conventional image. This is a hairline slip in an otherwise exceptional execution, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, though slightly overwritten in peak beats (e.g., "fractal resembling a fractured heart" verges on redundancy). Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with the scene's tension. No major artifacts, but minor figurative density prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is highly poetic and dense, but this creates minor figurative overload in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "shimmering veil that pulsed with the hush of time's fraying edges"), slightly obscuring immediacy and causal clarity. Rhythm is generally strong and purposeful, though a few sentences verge on syntactic monotony. No significant loops or scaffolding; information density is high and advances the story.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. A minor prose artifact exists: a template cadence run describing the arches ("ancient and defiant in their azure glow, hovered like frozen waves, casting shadows that danced") and a slight paraphrase loop between "azure defiance" and "rebellious blue." This incurs a small deduction but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythm, but suffers from minor figurative overload in peak beats ("shadows elongated, and the air thickened with the scent of blooming nightflowers from a world that never was"). A single paraphrase loop ("cyclically spontaneous") triggers a small deduction, but clarity at closure is unharmed.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and varied syntax, though some figurative density ("luminescent ache," "ethereal glows") risks mild overwriting in peak beats without fully obscuring causality. Information density is high, and closure remains clear. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing plot and atmosphere. A minor figurative muddle occurs with "shadows dwelled—spectral remnants... like forgotten headlines," mixing metaphors slightly, but it does not obscure the closure. Rhythm is varied and supports the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. Minor figurative stacking ("forgotten dreams," "whispered of forgotten winds") in the opening creates a slight momentum drag, but it is pattern-taught and pays off in closure. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple jobs. No loops or scaffolding artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose has high information density and clear propulsion, with varied rhythm and sentence openings. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Minor scaffold exists ("mundane miracles" appears twice) but does not obscure closure or cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density with clear propulsion; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Minimal artifacts: slight repetition of "bound release" but not obstructive. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, e.g., "communities reforming under the songs' spell." Rhythm varies naturally, supporting scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in "enlarged tranquility, a vast calm that expanded" (near-paraphrase) and occasional filter verbs ("felt an urge"). However, these do not obscure closure, and information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished and purposeful, with excellent rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "sacred ordinary unveiled" in the climax has a slightly elevated, summary quality that contrasts with the otherwise embodied prose, creating a small register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery, though occasional dense metaphors ("heartbeat on the verge of stopping") slightly risk coherence in peak beats. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple layers. No significant loops or artifacts; propulsion remains clear, supporting the closure effect without obscurity.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong momentum. Figurative language is effective and consistent ("rotting pier," "forgotten dream"). Minor scaffold exists in the three "false start" declarations, creating a slight template cadence, but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language ("danced like forgotten holograms") is purposeful and coherent. A minor instance of near-paraphrase ("terrestrially cosmic" used twice) prevents a higher score but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("His charcoal-fingered hands trembling as he unpacked his sketchbook"). A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in phrases like "auroral sorrow" and "mnemonically gifted," which, while thematically fitting, momentarily distance the reader from Elias's immediate, visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density. Sentences are varied and rhythmically controlled. No loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddle. The description is woven seamlessly through action. The final line is a strong, conceptual image that recharges the premise without summarization.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite and purposeful, with high information density. A slight risk of overwriting exists in a few phrases ("kinetic sculpture stirred, its arms gliding in elegant arcs"), where the diction leans decorative. However, this does not obscure closure clarity or cause significant momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythm, but occasional stacked modifiers ("static-laced reverie") risk slight opacity in peak beats. No loops or scaffold; sentences advance plot and atmosphere efficiently. Figurative language ("like corralling wildfire") is purposeful and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished and purposeful, with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. A minor instance of scaffold phrasing exists ("Through neighborhood storytelling, he began"), but it does not obscure causality or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely exquisite and purposeful, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight artifacting in the peak beat: "a pirouette for a vowel shift, a leap for a rhythmic encryption" has a template-cadence feel. The rhythm is otherwise controlled and supports the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and purposeful, with strong information density. Sentences like "waves to hang suspended mid-crash" and "salt crystals bloomed like frozen fireworks" are potent and original. A minor template cadence emerges in a few consecutive sentences starting with "He" or "The," and the coffee ground method's introduction has a slight summary quality, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight synonym churn ("smoothed hush," "refined veil of quiet") and one template cadence ("He knelt... He began..."). These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("stars piercing the sky"). Rhythm varies effectively, accelerating during the interrogation. No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Closure image is clear and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly evocative and generally clear, with strong rhythmic control. A minor deduction for occasional dense figurative language that borders on overwriting in high-pressure beats (e.g., "petals unfurled like whispered secrets"), slightly obscuring immediacy without fully harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variation. Figurative language ("pillars of veined stone rose like frozen prayers") is purposeful and pattern-taught. Minor deduction for slight density in the opening paragraph, which momentarily slows momentum, but clarity and propulsion are excellent throughout, especially in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, some overwriting is present, such as the stacked modifiers in "reed-blown melancholy" and "serpentine nexus," which slightly blur sense and momentum in high-pressure beats. The closure, however, remains clear and unaffected by these minor artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control ("where the ice whispered secrets of forgotten voyages"). There is high information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. A minor deduction for a subtle paraphrase loop: "windows of connection" and "fragile portals" appear close together, and the phrase "borrowed starlight" is repeated. These are minor and don't obscure closure, but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is dense and lyrical but maintains propulsion, with figurative language serving the accumulative pattern. A minor instance of potential synonym churn ("scintillatingly somber glow") appears but is pattern-taught and does not obscure closure. Sentence-level rhythm is varied and supports the contemplative yet forward-moving pace.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and propulsive. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "comfortable lies" is used twice, creating a slight paraphrase loop. However, this does not significantly obscure causality or dull the closure image, and the information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, it suffers from minor figurative muddle (e.g., "gritty whimsy" creates a tonal clash) and a tendency toward synonym churn ("forgotten waves," "radio ghosts," "spectral echoes"). These artifacts are present but do not critically obscure the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly crafted with strong rhythm and variation. Information density is high, with sentences advancing multiple elements. Minor figurative density appears in some sentences but is pattern-taught and pays off, not obscuring clarity. No significant loops, scaffold, or artifacting. A slight over-reliance on the visual sense in early description prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is largely vivid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is occasionally over-stacked or slightly mixed (e.g., "fabric whispering against his skin like a lover's breath" next to "frozen ghosts"), creating minor density artifacts that slightly dull clarity in high-pressure beats without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, efficient imagery ("glassy tomb," "luminous trails"). Information density is excellent, with lines like "restrained wildness stirred" doing multiple jobs. No significant loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. A single instance of mild synonym churn ("patient revolution" / "gradual tide" / "enduring strength") in the final paragraph prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive with high information density. However, a pattern of dense, figurative language in high-pressure beats ("collective spirit of the unfree," "drowning hope in repetition") creates minor artifacts that slightly obscure clarity at the climax. The rhythm is otherwise well-controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. Rhythm is controlled and varies effectively with the scene's needs. A minor deduction for occasional dense metaphorical phrasing (e.g., "melodies frozen in time") that, while beautiful, slightly risks obscuring immediacy in a few spots. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and vivid with high information density, though occasional overwriting ("ceaseless churn of the acid sea") slightly blunts momentum. Figurative language is generally purposeful and coherent. No critical artifacts obscure causality or closure, but minor synonym churn ("evolving," "adapting," "mutating") appears in one paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. Minor scaffold appears in the phrase "sensed absence," which is repeated three times, creating a slight echo that dulls the final usage. Information density is otherwise excellent, with sentences advancing multiple layers of story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly dense and purposeful, with sentences doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. Minor figurative strain in "apples frozen mid-bloom, as if holding their breath" slightly blurs the physical logic of the setting. Otherwise, the line-level craft is strong and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with strong rhythmic control, though slightly over-written in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "reality slipped entirely; she saw her grandmother..."). A minor deduction for a template cadence in "Days blurred into a rhythm of wind-whipped tasks." However, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closure image is undimmed.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is generally strong and evocative, but minor artifacts occur. A slight synonym churn exists (e.g., "gentle soul," "gently persuasive," "subtle passion"). A template cadence appears in phrases like "He spoke... She revealed." These do not majorly obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("silken walls sighed") is consistent, voice-motivated, and enhances clarity without muddle. There are no loops, scaffold, or artifacting; every sentence advances story or atmosphere. The final line possesses a potent, image-based propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor issues include a subtle over-reliance on the word "arc" and the phrase "as vines climbed," creating a faint template cadence. These do not significantly obscure clarity or momentum, but prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery, though occasionally dense with figurative language ("like hesitant whispers," "like tears from forgotten stars") that risks slight overwriting in high-pressure beats. Information density is excellent, with sentences advancing multiple functions. No loops or scaffolding artifacts obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control and information density. A minor deduction for a potential figurative muddle in "fog-wreathed scrap metal, its form shifting as if breathing the sounds of yesteryears," where the vehicle slightly strains coherence. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a few instances of potentially overwrought figurative language ("white beard flowing like comet trails") and a template cadence in the description of the clock ("spinning, its frantic whirl defying...") introduce minor artifacts. These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with varied rhythm and sentence openings. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off (e.g., "hope's scent"). Minor scaffold in repetitive "pulsing stillness" but no clarity loss. Closure image remains sharp and unobscured.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control. There is a minor instance of potential register drift ("ethereal hush," "starlit void") in the opening line, but it quickly settles into a voice consistent with the POV. No loops or artifacts obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely lucid and propulsive, with strong rhythmic control and high information density. However, minor artifacts are present: a paraphrase loop ("yearned not for vengeance... yearned deeply now") and some stacked modifiers ("shrewdly innocent," "calculated observation") create slight scaffolding. These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score. The final paragraph's cadence is effective and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lush and highly textured, with excellent rhythmic control and information density. However, minor artifacts appear, such as the slightly repetitive trigger phrase "as memories resurfaced" and a register drift in "languid curls" which, while beautiful, edges toward ornamentation in a high-pressure beat. These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score. The sentence-level propulsion and read-aloud quality are otherwise exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously ("swirls and lines like forgotten algorithms reborn as art"). No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. Closure image is clear and impactful. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly accomplished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative overload in high-pressure beats (e.g., "vines of possibility snarled with thorns of regret") which, while voice-motivated, occasionally risks coherence. Otherwise, clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is lush and generally well-controlled, with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. However, minor artifacts are present, including a tendency toward slightly elevated diction ("verdant arbor," "ethereal gold") that, while fitting, creates a consistent register that occasionally borders on ornamental. There is no major figurative muddle or looped phrasing to warrant a larger deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. A slight over-reliance on figurative language in the climax ("liquid silver," "pulsing like a living heart") creates minor density, but momentum and clarity remain intact.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("dust motes that danced like captured sounds"). A minor instance of near-synonym churn ("reflective man," "reflective sighs," "reflections deepening") prevents a perfect score, but it does not obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose has high information density and rhythmic control ("shingled hush enveloped the grotto"). No loops or scaffold; figurative language is pattern-taught (e.g., "fractal" motifs). Sentences advance story and atmosphere simultaneously. Minor register elevation in "whalebone reverie" but voice-motivated and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exquisite with high information density and varied rhythm. Minor register drift in "earthly nostalgia" slightly elevates diction beyond POV's lexicon. No loops or scaffold issues. Figurative language consistently supports clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density ("ambitions once sharp as coral reefs, now eroded"). Rhythm varies naturally, though some sentences are complex. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in clusters ("fragments of memory swirled like the lagoon's perpetual eddies"), but clarity remains intact, and no loops or artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slight repetition of the phrase "stoic wonder" and a near-paraphrase loop describing the terminal as both "forgotten relic" and "abandoned spaceport." However, these do not obscure closure, and the information density remains high.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and purposeful, varied syntax. The prose is largely free of scaffolds and loops. The primary deduction is for a minor instance of overwriting in the climax ("excruciatingly gentle" is used three times), which slightly diminishes the power of this key modifier through repetition and creates a small text artifact in a peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) for the repetitive use of "errant" and the slightly templated cadence in "serene upheaval of dusk... serene upheaval enveloped him." This does not obscure closure but creates a minor echo.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "salt-crusted and frayed" rope). A single instance of potential scaffold exists ("The rope, salt-crusted and frayed, looped in intricate knots..."), but it is minor and does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. However, a tendency toward dense figurative language in high-pressure beats ("like the ribs of some ancient, forsaken cathedral") creates a slight momentum drag, preventing a score in the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for potential overwriting: the dense figurative language in some high-pressure beats ("stalactites shedding dust like falling stars") slightly risks clarity, though it remains legible and is largely pattern-taught. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied rhythm. No loops or scaffold artifacts obscure closure. Figurative language ("bruised sky," "kelp-drift peace") is pattern-taught and pays off, enhancing clarity without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("wings frozen mid-beat") serves the moment without muddle. Minor scaffold in phrases like "defiant hush" repeated, but no artifacts harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly evocative, with strong rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a tendency toward dense figurative language that, while beautiful, occasionally risks slight over-writing (e.g., "framing the timeframe of her vigil across the quiet sigh of falling petals"). However, clarity and momentum are never truly lost, and the closure beat remains potent.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly vivid and dense, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures. There is a slight tendency toward overwriting in the density of figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "silent storm of orange and black," "whirlwind of calm intensity"), which creates a minor muddle. However, the closure image remains crystal clear, and the propulsion never falters.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language ("metronome of fate") is effective and coherent. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent sentences restating the same concept (e.g., "incremental absolution" phrasing), but this does not obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: a slight register drift in "jaunty tune" feels tonally bright against the opening "velveteen gloom," creating a small dissonance. However, the figurative language is generally coherent and serves the accumulative drive, and momentum is well-maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent. A minor artifact penalty (-0.4) is applied for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a high-pressure beat (e.g., "the blank page a threshold"), which, while beautiful, creates a small momentum drag at the climax. Otherwise, line-level craft is exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent, pattern-taught, and enhances clarity rather than obscuring it. There are no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; every sentence advances character, atmosphere, or plot with masterful concision.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. However, a figurative muddle appears in the peak beat: "ground from the bones of ancient illusions" is a register drift into elevated, vague diction that slightly obscures the concrete action of powdering the portrait.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a few instances of potential scaffold, like the repeated use of "agonize/agonized" which slightly dulls immediacy. Figurative language is effective and coherent, and sentence-level propulsion is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, with high information density. A minor deduction for a slight momentum drag in the second paragraph with its extended description of the zither, which, while beautiful, borders on decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is richly textured and generally purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor instances of overwriting and dense metaphor ("iron skeletons loomed like forgotten giants") slightly impede momentum without obscuring closure. The sentence-level propulsion is effective, and the final line achieves a clean, resonant cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and rhythmic with high information density. Minor deduct for the slightly repetitive use of "nectar dusk" and a single instance of near-paraphrase ("wonder leeched from the everyday miracle"). Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and clear, with no artifacts obscuring closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. However, a minor prose artifact occurs in the climax: "a silent inferno of revelation" slightly muddles the established figurative logic of "hush" and "blaze," creating a momentary, distracting mixed metaphor that touches the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is densely packed in high-pressure beats (e.g., “like a scalpel wrapped in silk,” “like hesitant thoughts”), creating a slight drag on momentum without fully obscuring clarity. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally clear, concise, and purposeful, propelling the narrative forward. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for a slight template cadence in the opening description ("ascended and descended without beginning or end") and the repeated abstract noun "texture." These do not harm closure but slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and vivid, concrete imagery. Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact deduction for a template cadence in the description of the daydreams ("Another symbol:... The brush's tip gleamed..."), which creates a slight repetitive rhythm in an otherwise fluid passage.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly accomplished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for slight overwriting: the phrase "rosewater dread" is repeated, creating a subtle loop, and the construction "floral unease, like rosewater masking the dread" is slightly mixed. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and dense with information, advancing story and atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lush and highly evocative with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight instance of overwriting ("bleak exhilaration" is used twice, slightly diluting its power) and a potential mixed metaphor in "sun rising in reverse." Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and evocative, with strong rhythmic control. However, figurative language is occasionally over-stacked in high-pressure beats (e.g., "voice like silk over rusted blades" followed by "repulsive allure"), creating a minor muddle that slightly obscures immediacy at the peak. No loops or scaffolding issues.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lush and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic propulsion and vivid imagery. There is minor density in the figurative language, but it serves the accumulative, pattern-based design and does not obscure closure. The final sentences achieve a clean, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.1)
    High information density and rhythmic control. Prose is concise and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("The crack echoed like thunder..."). Minimal artifacts; a single potential synonym churn ("sun-bleached" / "sunwashed") is negligible and doesn't obscure closure. Read-aloud quality is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is largely clean and propulsive, with high information density. However, minor artifacts exist: a slight over-reliance on figurative language in some beats (e.g., "ivy clung like whispered secrets") and a few near-synonym phrases ("wilted and spent"). These do not obscure closure but prevent a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in a few phrases ("like a blade against his soul," "shadowed blood") which, while voice-motivated, approach density limits in a high-pressure beat. However, no loops, scaffolds, or clarity issues; the closure image remains sharp and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally clear and purposeful, with good rhythm. Minor artifact: "tranquilly perceptive" edges toward label-speak. A slight paraphrase loop occurs with "reclaimed stillness" and its variants. However, these do not significantly obscure closure or causality.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush and highly atmospheric, with strong rhythmic control. However, minor overwriting and a high density of figurative language in peak beats ("kaleidoscope of luminous agony") create slight muddle, preventing a higher score. The closure image remains clear and potent despite this.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control and varied sentence structures that accelerate with the hunt. However, slight overwriting appears in a high-pressure beat: "pools of unused potential manifesting as glowing nodes, intangibly tangible wisps that felt real through the interface, like touching dreams" stacks modifiers and metaphors, slightly blurring sense. This figurative muddle in a peak beat prevents a 9+ score, though it does not break closure clarity. The opening and closing lines are exceptionally strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is generally strong with good rhythm and information density. However, minor artifacts are present, including the repetitive use of "brilliant dimness" and "perpetual surprise," which slightly dull the immediacy of key beats through template cadence. The description remains clear and propulsive, and these repetitions do not significantly harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is generally superb with high information density and rhythmic control. Minor deductions for occasional over-written phrases ("sieved hush of the conscience") and a template cadence in the description of the driftwood ("twisted roots... branches whittled..."). These artifacts are present but do not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and purposeful, with high information density and rhythmic control that accelerates and breathes with the scene's needs. Figurative language is pattern-taught and pays off, such as the mist lingering like his "unabsolved yet acknowledged" error. No scaffolding, loops, or artifacting that obscure causality or closure. The final paragraph is a model of concision and resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid, purposeful imagery and good rhythmic control. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a paraphrase loop ("adrift in the wreckage of his own life" / "carefully built world... crumbled") and some stacked modifiers ("merrily melancholic way," "bittersweet anchor") create slight density in early beats. The closure, however, remains clear and potent.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and propelled, with strong sensory imagery and varied sentence structures. No significant loops or artifacts clutter key beats. The description of the lake as "delicately robust" is a purposeful echo that enhances texture without muddling sense.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose is lush and generally purposeful, but suffers from minor figurative density in peak beats (e.g., "cosmic intimacy that made the stars feel like lovers' breaths") which slightly obscures clarity. Rhythm is controlled, and sentence-level propulsion advances the story without major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly lyrical and dense, but this creates minor momentum drag in peak beats (e.g., "choking beauty that tightened her throat"). However, the language is purposeful and the closure image remains clear and powerful. The sentence-level craft is otherwise exceptional, with strong rhythm and vivid, concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lucid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a template cadence in the description of the second photograph ("Another photograph: a group of protesters...") and a slight synonym churn between "ghostly" and "spectral." These do not obscure closure but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, but minor artifacting occurs in peak beats. The phrase "texture of transformation" is repeated, and the climactic epiphany uses slightly elevated diction ("orchestrated coincidences weaving the fabric of fate") that feels a degree removed from the POV's immediate embodied experience.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly concise and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "The tone of the evening was a winking hush"). Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on compound adjectives ("calmly inventive," "half-painted") which, while effective, appear frequently. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is highly poetic and dense, successfully maintaining rhythm and propulsion. However, a minor deduction is applied for figurative density; phrases like "ghosts chasing forgotten dreams" and "borrowed dawn" are effective but risk feeling slightly ornamental in concentration, though they do not obscure closure. The sentence-level craft is otherwise exemplary, with strong variation and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly lyrical with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor figurative over-density appears in phrases like "storm-kissed wonder" and "turbulent awe," creating a slight decorative weight in high-pressure beats without fully obscuring clarity. No loops or scaffolding issues. Read-aloud test is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is generally lush and purposeful, but suffers from minor artifacts. A template cadence emerges in lists ("blades clashed like arguments, parries polite as rebuttals"). Some synonymous phrasing ("serene underscore," "quiet flow") creates slight redundancy, though momentum is maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly purposeful, with excellent rhythm and syntactic variety. However, a minor pattern of "fracture" imagery ("silver fractures," "luminous fracture," "fractured halo") creates a slight decorative echo that doesn't fully advance sense, applying a small deduction. The closure beat remains clear and potent, and momentum is strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    High information density with minimal scaffolding. Figurative language ("notes sharp as resolve") serves character and atmosphere. Minor template cadence in early description paragraphs, but peak beats remain clean. No artifacts affecting closure.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, but controlled. Figurative language is pattern-taught and serves the theme (e.g., "doubt luminous as the ridge's blossoms"). A minor instance of scaffold phrasing exists ("Doubt lingered luminously—had she truly wakened it..."), creating a slight paraphrase loop that prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is polished and dense, with high information density and varied syntax that supports the contemplative rhythm. Figurative language ("cerulean regret") is consistent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.8)
    Supple sentences with purposeful imagery; information density is good and momentum generally holds. Some purple tilt and phrase recurrence (“strategically creative,” “steely longing,” repeated “refuge”) lightly pad pressure beats. No serious metaphoric muddle or cadence template issues. Tightening a few echoing lines would sharpen the blade.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lyrical prose is controlled, with varied syntax and strong image economy; most lines do double duty. A few phrases recur (“luminous doubt,” “empirically whimsical”), but they function as motif rather than filler. No significant figurative muddle or loops blunt momentum. Final cadence lands cleanly without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean, purposeful lines with good information density; images do multiple jobs (compass as tool and metaphor). Occasional repetition of blue/cerulean/tide imagery and abstract verbs (“diffuse”) risks slight redundancy but doesn’t stall momentum. Syntax varies and supports a soft build. No major scaffolding or figurative muddle at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and controlled, but conceptual repetition around "preprocessing reality" and summarizing sentences in the final paragraph function as scaffolding. These moments tell the emotional conclusion instead of allowing the final action to carry the full weight of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of adjectives and figurative language that occasionally dulls momentum. Phrases like "drifting resonance that echoed her fractured thoughts" are tautological, and runs of descriptive terms can feel more decorative than purposeful. This lexical richness, while often beautiful, sometimes slows the pacing and obscures the story's strong narrative core.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, a high density of figurative language ("silent symphony," "frozen melodies," "danced like silent notes") occasionally risks becoming overwrought, slightly cluttering the narrative with its own artistry. The piece avoids major mechanical flaws but could benefit from more selective use of metaphor to heighten its most critical moments.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose contains moments of lovely imagery but is frequently marred by redundancy and overwriting. Phrases like "cracked like fractured ice" and paraphrase loops that restate Elias's goal create drag. The mechanical repetition of key words and concepts throughout the story is a significant line-level flaw that erodes the polish required for publication, preventing the prose from achieving consistent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is marred by significant repetition of key phrases ("gently persistent," "amplified quiet," "midnight food runs"). This functions as a prose artifact, creating a "template-cadence" that, while possibly intentional, reads as a stylistic crutch that lessens the prose's propulsion. This recurring scaffold, especially in the final third, prevents the piece from achieving top-tier polish and caps other categories at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from moments of overwriting and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "spiritually curious and driven by an insatiable motivation" and "pilgrim of sparks—wandering seeker" are examples of synonym churn that pad the sentence without adding new information. This tendency towards abstraction and near-repetition in key descriptive passages slightly dulls the story's momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is undermined by a distinct text artifact: lexical repetition. The word "quaking" appears four times, and similar terms like "trembled" and "shiver" are also frequent. This recurrence, especially in high-pressure beats, creates a loop that dulls the impact of otherwise strong imagery and feels like a tic rather than a deliberate motif.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and repetition, which constitutes a notable text artifact. The phrase "staggering grace" is used multiple times, and the density of similes and elevated adjectives is excessive, particularly for a high-pressure scene. This stylistic choice, while consistent, ultimately draws attention to itself and dulls the momentum and clarity of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft, with high information density and a rhythmic, purposeful cadence. Figurative language is rich but rarely overwrought, consistently serving the story's atmosphere and character. A minor observation: the sentence "their impact reshaping his every invention..." leans slightly more towards summary than the rest of the highly-dramatized piece, a hairline slip in an otherwise immaculate execution.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative and generally well-crafted, with strong imagery. The primary flaw is the repetition of key thematic words and phrases, most notably "luminous disbelief" appearing three times. This creates a loop that dulls momentum and feels like an artificial imposition on the text. Some phrasing also leans toward being slightly overwrought ("a forest under siege by twilight," "the world itself doubted the wonders"), which slightly detracts from the otherwise strong line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean and contains some evocative imagery. The primary weakness is a tendency toward "scaffolding" language that explains the story's own symbolism, such as calling the bookmark "a metaphor for his own iced-over heart." This type of prose artifact explains rather than dramatizes, momentarily pulling the reader out of the scene to explain its meaning and slowing the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, maintaining momentum through the scene. However, it suffers from several instances of scaffolding and telling where showing is needed (e.g., "The betrayal had been transformative, reshaping him..."). There are also moments of conceptual redundancy, such as explicitly labeling the character "firmly adaptive" right before he adapts, which weaken the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the prose is often beautiful and evocative, it relies on several instances of direct, declarative scaffolding. Sentences like "The timeframe was...", "Her motivation was singular:", and "Her method was unique:" tell the reader the story's components rather than letting them emerge purely through action. This slightly undermines the otherwise immersive craft by creating moments of authorial summary that momentarily break the spell.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often lyrical, it is significantly hampered by lexical repetition. Key terms like "amalgamate," "looped timelines," "mundane mysticism," and "composed" are used multiple times, creating scaffold-like loops that reduce momentum and information density. This redundancy is the story's most significant flaw, making the craft feel less polished than the concept.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from overwriting and repetition that dulls momentum. Phrases like "resonant hush" and "ambiguously clear" are used multiple times, becoming artifacts rather than fresh descriptions. The inclusion of abstract, conceptual sentences ("The act was honesty incarnate") disrupts the sensory texture and reads like scaffolding left in the final draft.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is rhythmic but weakened by an over-reliance on stock similes ("skin like dried bark," "voice cracking like old wood"). Pivotal moments, such as Elias's nightly care for the vine, are summarized rather than shown in concrete, sensory detail, which stalls momentum. While the sentences are clear, the lack of scenic immediacy and the density of familiar figurative language hold the craft back.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and evocative, but it suffers from the conspicuous repetition of key prompt phrases ("mechanically warm," "subdued awakenings," "obliging," "icy warmth"). This repetition, while thematic, creates a scaffold-like texture that feels slightly artificial, particularly when "mechanically warm" is used for both a person and a machine, blunting its specificity. It reads less like an organic motif and more like a checklist being fulfilled.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Momentum is generally well-maintained. A few instances of mild overwriting and paraphrase-loops ("not ruining but transforming; the moisture seeped...") slightly dilute the information density. Phrases like "conversing without utterance" are stylistically ambitious but border on imprecision, creating minor friction in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting, particularly in its reliance on dense, abstract figurative language during peak moments. Phrases like "prophecies absorbed errors like a sponge" and the climax's description of weight as "the auroral sorrow of lost years, the swaying certainties of what could have been said" lean on conceptual assertion over concrete imagery. This tendency towards abstraction dulls the impact of the final, crucial beat.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains strong imagery, but is hampered by a recurring lack of concision and some overwriting. There are several paraphrase loops where adjacent clauses or sentences restate the same idea with different words (e.g., the description of his mental state in paragraph three). The final sentence functions as a thematic summary, a common anti-pattern that tells the reader the story's meaning ("yielding not treasure, but clarity...") rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is elegant but marred by conspicuous conceptual repetition that functions as a prose artifact. Phrases like "regenerative silence," "crumbling peace," and "grips reality loosely" are looped almost verbatim, creating paraphrase loops that dull momentum rather than build incantatory power. This redundancy, particularly the restatement of "regenerative silence" in the final third, prevents the piece from achieving top-tier polish.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is fluid and often evocative, but it is marred by repetitive phrasing that feels like scaffolding. The recurrence of "dreaming roots," "hush," and "sage," while atmospheric, approaches a template-cadence. The verbatim repetition of the phrase "cautious exuberance" is a distinct prose artifact that dulls momentum and signals a lack of lexical variety at a key moment, preventing the prose from achieving a higher level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is evocative and skillfully crafted, but it is weakened by noticeable repetition. The attribute "sensitively perceptive" appears three times, and the core motivation is explained and restated in similar terms, creating a slight drag on momentum. These prose artifacts, while not touching the closure beat directly, constitute a clear loop issue that detracts from an otherwise high level of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, but it is marred by a recurring reliance on abstract conceptual labels ("symphony," "harmony," "transpose," "orchestrate"). This repetitive phrasing functions as a thematic scaffold, telling the reader the story's meaning rather than allowing the concrete actions and images to carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it occasionally slips into overwriting, with a high density of abstract figurative language ("muffled blade cutting through the clarity of deception"). While this supports the tone, it sometimes sacrifices momentum and clarity for poetic effect. There are no significant grammatical errors, but a few phrases feel slightly scaffolded, restating a concept just articulated.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    While often beautiful, the prose suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought, particularly in the opening paragraphs. Minor paraphrase loops ("chronologically homesick, a peculiar affliction that made him ache...") slightly slow the momentum. This tendency toward elaboration over concision prevents the prose from achieving the highest level of crispness and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it occasionally relies on abstract, high-concept language ("procedural generation," "algorithm crafting infinite worlds") that feels more asserted than integrated. There are minor instances of conceptual looping, such as "labyrinth of self, that twisting maze." The most significant issue is the climax, where the summary "she forgave, released, conquered" replaces a more immediate, visceral depiction of this crucial internal shift, slightly dulling its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally strong and evocative, but it suffers from occasional overwriting and conceptual redundancy. Phrases describing the "filament of hush" are layered thickly, and the repetition of keywords like "hush," "muted," and "numbness" becomes slightly incantatory, dulling the forward momentum. A lighter touch would have allowed the story's powerful images to resonate more.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. The story's momentum is occasionally dampened by sentences that summarize motivation or process rather than dramatizing them ("He chose this life to nurture integrity..."). While the line-level craft is generally high, these moments of abstraction prevent it from achieving flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often evocative and precise, with strong sensory details. However, the momentum is occasionally dampened by abstract summaries in key moments, most notably "the scents wove understanding into his pain," a line that tells the outcome of the climax rather than letting the concrete imagery complete the work.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and high-quality, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, a few minor artifacts prevent a top-tier score. There are slight redundancies, particularly the repeated use of "subtle passion," which dulls its impact. One sentence ("To discover time's texture, he knew he must engage in the action of patterning...") reads as slightly over-explanatory scaffolding in an otherwise seamlessly poetic narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with moments of beautiful figurative language ("branches weaving through shattered panes like veins in a glass heart"). However, the density of such metaphors occasionally verges on overwriting, creating a slight tension with the story's stated theme of "simplicity." While free of major artifacts, a few minor phrasal repetitions slightly dilute its otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, but its momentum is occasionally slowed by scaffolding sentences that explain process ("The method she employed was..."). A few instances of conceptual redundancy also slightly dilute the otherwise high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally clean but suffers from several prose artifacts. There is significant repetition of key phrases ("cautious exuberance," "whimsical attentiveness," "silent contributors"), which functions as a template-like scaffold. The story also tends to summarize emotional states ("Curiosity piqued," "Elias felt a pull in his chest") where more specific, embodied action would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is elegant and the word choice is often beautiful, but it is marred by distinct prose artifacts. The phrase "luminescent ache" is repeated three times, as is "webs of kinship," creating a loop that dulls its initial impact. This reliance on a few key phrases, combined with a consistently high density of figurative language, makes the prose feel slightly overwrought and less propulsive than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and imaginative, with strong verbs and vivid imagery. However, a few sentences are burdened by excessive exposition, slightly slowing the momentum. Lines like "...granting its bearer the attribute to sculpt time itself" and "Elara realized she must..." function more as summary than dramatization, preventing the prose from achieving perfect leanness and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm and syntax support the contemplative, methodical tone. However, there are minor instances of conceptual redundancy, where adjacent phrases slightly re-state an idea (e.g., "ambiguous loss—the kind that lingered like mist, unclear and unresolved"), which could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is hampered by minor but noticeable text artifacts. A template cadence appears in several action beats (e.g., "With methodical care," "With kindly methodical steps"). The repetition of the key phrase "kindly methodical" feels redundant rather than reinforcing. These recurring patterns slightly dull the otherwise sharp and atmospheric line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is generally elegant and precise, with strong sensory details ("air smelled of wet earth and renewal"). The rhythm is controlled and supports the story's momentum. The primary weakness is the occasional use of scaffolding phrases that explain subtext, such as the line about her "circuitous sincerity at work," which functions as a prose artifact that tells rather than shows.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, but it is significantly marred by repetitive phrasing that acts as a conceptual scaffold. Key terms—"thresh meaning," "convergence," "wryly earnest," "haggard awe"—are reused to the point of becoming a template cadence. This synonym churn and conceptual redundancy, especially the multiple uses of "thresh," dulls the momentum and makes the prose feel constructed rather than organic, a critical flaw for publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose contains strong individual images ("ink bleeding into water"), its momentum is significantly hampered by mechanical repetition. Key phrases like "unseen forces," "steadily unpredictable," and "didn't see it coming" are recycled to a degree that they read like artifacts from a checklist. This looping structure reduces information density and gives the prose a templated, inorganic rhythm that dulls the impact of the otherwise clean lines.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally polished and often evocative, but it suffers from a prose artifact: conceptual looping. Key abstract terms are repeated across adjacent paragraphs, creating redundancy ("compile these fragmented glimpses," then "compiling our pains into purpose," then "compiling fragments of wood, stone, and story"). This lessens the information density and momentum, reading more like thematic reinforcement than propulsive narration.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=3.8)
    The prose suffers from severe and pervasive text artifacts, primarily through the constant repetition of multi-word phrases ("trembling certainty," "analytically artistic," "starlit vault"). This creates a monotonous, template-like cadence that stalls momentum and reads as artificial. While some imagery is evocative, these loops are a critical flaw that would necessitate a complete line-level rewrite for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative. However, there are minor but noticeable prose artifacts that prevent a higher score. Constructions like "The action required was... The method was..." read like scaffolding, and some adjacent sentences ("Skepticism warred... Courage bolstered her kindness") create a repetitive, template-like cadence that slightly dulls momentum in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.3)
    While the prose is grammatically clean and contains some strong images, it is significantly marred by mechanical repetition of key phrases from the prompt ("hushed thunder," "spatial mutiny," "intrigue"). This text-artifact issue creates a sense of artificiality and disrupts narrative flow, suggesting adherence to a checklist over organic expression. This loop-like quality is the story's most notable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is generally clean and often evocative, with strong imagery in the descriptions of the setting. However, there are moments of conceptual overwriting where abstract phrases ("deathly vitality," "bureaucratic intransigence") are asked to do the work of concrete action. The passage detailing the "algorithm" is a key example of telling over showing, summarizing a complex process ("risk factors multiplied by moral weights") in a way that feels like a scaffold for the idea rather than a lived moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting and repetitive phrasing. The recurrence of words like "earnest," "restrained," and "incandescent" feels slightly heavy-handed, and some constructions are dense with adjectives ("gilded-leaf stationer," "unyielding fog," "earnestly studious nature"). These moments create a slight drag on momentum, preventing an otherwise strong piece from achieving true line-level flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative but suffers from a noticeable template cadence, particularly in the repetition of key verbs that structure the beats ("filtering," "layering"). This pattern, while thematically relevant, becomes a slight prose artifact that dulls momentum. For instance, the phrase "survivor, filtering this through..." appears in slightly varied forms multiple times, creating a loop that could be more elegantly varied.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it suffers from overwriting and repetition. A conceptual loop is created by the constant reuse of "gloomy," "cheerful," and their synonyms, which dulls their impact. Sentences are frequently dense with modifiers, and this stylistic density sometimes slows momentum rather than enhancing it, particularly around pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is clean but lacks momentum and information density due to its reliance on summary. Sentences frequently describe broad swathes of time and action ("Night after night...she sprayed vibrant designs") instead of focusing on a concrete, immediate moment. This leads to a high degree of telling over showing and the use of abstract nouns ("gentrification," "privatization," "desperation") where specific, sensory details would be more impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong sentence-level craft. However, some phrases lean towards abstraction or summary where concrete embodiment would be more powerful (e.g., "poignant sorrow for the irreplaceable"). There's a minor paraphrase loop in the third paragraph, where "Her purposefully curious mind wandered..." restates the trait mentioned in the second paragraph without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, with strong sensory details. Its primary weakness is the repetitive use of keywords—"heartfelt" and "magnetic calm"—which act as a text artifact, looping the same descriptors instead of allowing the atmosphere to emerge from varied descriptions. This scaffolding dulls the impact of an otherwise strong and rhythmic line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=5.5)
    This category reveals the story's critical flaw: pervasive text-artifact loops. Key phrases—"dry wit," "subtly confident," "worrying tranquility," "herald," "singular convergence"—are repeated multiple times, severely damaging momentum and reading like checklist fulfillment. This template-like cadence and synonym churn is a significant craft issue that keeps an otherwise promising story from reaching a publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is often elegant, it is severely marred by repetitive phrasing. Key terms like "wild hush," "infinitely patient," and "cryptic" are used to the point of becoming prose artifacts, creating a looping effect that dulls momentum. This degree of repetition goes beyond stylistic choice into scaffold-like construction, a significant flaw under the rubric that obscures the story's other strengths at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it is hampered by a tendency toward conceptual redundancy and overwriting. Phrases like "gathered hush," "knotted threads of stillness," and "accumulated quietude" circle the same abstract idea without adding new sensory information. The line "infiltrated her senses through some arcane means" is a notable instance of telling that bypasses the challenge of showing, weakening a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is ambitious but severely hampered by overwriting and conspicuous text artifacts. Thematic keywords—"hush," "repose," "copperlight," "thread," "impossibilities"—are looped insistently, creating a scaffold-like structure that dulls momentum. This repetitive phrasing, combined with a density of figurative language that often feels decorative, ultimately weighs the narrative down and reads like an exercise in style over substance.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but hampered by significant repetition. Key phrases—"mournful elation," "lovingly venomous," "ephemeral cameo," "winter-cracked fields"—are used as refrains, creating a loop effect that diminishes their impact. This recurring scaffolding is the most significant flaw, preventing the otherwise evocative language from achieving its full potential.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, but it occasionally drifts into abstraction and overwriting, particularly when explaining concepts like "broken precedents." There are instances of telling where showing would be stronger (e.g., stating her motivation directly). While the rhythm is generally strong, a few sentences are burdened by stacked figurative language that slows momentum rather than enhances it.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, momentum is slightly dulled by repetition of key descriptors, such as "purposeful wandering" and "warmly curious." While intentional, this repetition feels more like labeling than organic reinforcement, creating a minor scaffold-like effect that detracts from the otherwise polished line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but a few instances of thematic summary slightly blunt its impact. Lines like "to discover meaning in the margins, those overlooked edges where true stories hid" and "turning margins into manifestos" verge on explaining the subtext, creating minor redundancy. While the overall craft is high, these moments of telling rather than purely showing are a small but distinct flaw for a piece aiming at flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often elegant, with strong imagery. However, it is held back by distinct, repeated prose artifacts. The phrase "echoed silence" is used four times, and several sentences serve to explain concepts that are already clear from context ("Her embroideries were no mere decorations..."). This scaffolding and conceptual redundancy dull the momentum in key places, representing a notable flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is evocative and dense with imagery, but it is significantly marred by repetition. The key phrase "fierce tenderness" appears four times, functioning as a thematic label that loses power with each use and reads like a prompt echo. This loop-like quality, especially in a short piece, creates a prose artifact that dulls the otherwise strong line-level craft and prevents the language from feeling fully organic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from significant artifacts. There is noticeable overwriting and repetition of key emotional phrases ("lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent"), which reads like a scaffold. The sentence "The core concept of their meeting unfolded naturally: shared anxieties..." is a critical flaw, a piece of meta-commentary that breaks narrative immersion and momentum. These issues obscure the otherwise solid imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often evocative with strong imagery, particularly in the opening. However, momentum is occasionally slowed by scaffolding and summary where dramatization would be stronger. For instance, explaining that the fragment "served as her core concept, a metaphorical negative" tells the reader its function rather than letting the image do the work, an artifact that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp craft.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, with dense clusters of figurative language in nearly every sentence that slow the momentum and feel decorative rather than functional. There are also instances of conceptual redundancy, such as "exchange certainty for curiosity—to trade the solid ground of knowledge for the thrilling vertigo of wonder," which restate the same idea. While evocative, the lack of concision is a major flaw that would require substantial editing.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is ambitious, with moments of strong imagery ("vines twisted like neural pathways"). However, it suffers from overwriting and repetition that dull momentum. The phrase "converging chaos" is used twice, diminishing the impact of the title concept. The density of figurative language sometimes feels strained, and the reliance on labels like "candidly cryptic" is a prose-level shortcut that could have been demonstrated more subtly through action or dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is lush and imagistic but suffers from overwriting, with figurative language packed into nearly every sentence, which can obscure meaning and slow momentum. There is also a reliance on recurring conceptual phrases ("shyly unstoppable," "photosynthesize pain," "reef-shadow joy") that function as thematic scaffolding rather than organic prose. This repetition, while reinforcing the core ideas, creates a slightly mechanical cadence that dulls the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and precise, but it is marred by a significant prose artifact: the verbatim repetition of key phrases ("gently systematic," "foxglove regret," "deserted marvels"). This loop creates a scaffold-like feel that dulls momentum and reads like a template cadence. While the imagery is strong, this recurring flaw prevents the line-level craft from achieving the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean but leans heavily on abstract, high-concept language ("symphonies of truth," "ethereal harmonies," "cascading truths") which can feel overwritten and vague. The climax relies on these abstractions rather than more grounded, sensory details. The repeated use of "cautious exuberance" is a notable prose artifact that dulls momentum and signals a lack of varied expression for the character's core emotional state, constituting a loop.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean and readable, but it's hampered by repetitive phrasing and conceptual tics. The phrase "slyly heartfelt" is used three times, becoming a noticeable authorial artifact rather than an organic part of the narrative. Some sentences feel overwrought, circling an idea rather than advancing it, which occasionally slows the story's momentum at key points.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, but it is weakened by a recurring prose artifact. The "blooming" and "withering" dyad is used as a scaffold four separate times to describe his existence, hope, fear, and finally the concept of trust itself. This repetition creates a template-like cadence that feels overly schematic and lessens the impact of what is otherwise strong, clear writing.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there are minor text artifacts from repetition. The phrases "fractured hush" and "intuiting" are used multiple times, and while thematic, this recurrence borders on a loop that slightly dulls its impact with each use. Despite this, the sentence-level propulsion is strong and the final lines land with clarity and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but overwrought, suffering from high figurative density and repetition that dulls momentum. The phrase "softly ingenious" is used twice, a clear oversight. Sentences are often laden with adjectives and clauses, creating a sluggish rhythm ("where dim bioluminescent glows stitched the darkness into veils of mystery"). There are also several near-paraphrases, such as the descriptions of shadows dancing like seams, which reduce information density and feel like scaffold rather than purposeful prose.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is stylistically ambitious and often beautiful, but it's hampered by a lack of concision and occasional overwriting. Several instances of paraphrase-loops exist, where a sentence's content is restated in the following clause or sentence, which slightly dulls momentum (e.g., "...act before memory fades, that fragile window..."). While the figurative language is strong, its high density verges on becoming purely decorative rather than consistently advancing the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, but it is marred by several minor artifacts that detract from its momentum. The phrase "lightly attentive" is repeated three times, becoming a noticeable tic rather than a powerful motif. There are also moments of slight redundancy and telling, such as "he orchestrated serendipity, making magic appear as mere happenstance," where two clauses state the same idea. These small loops and repetitions prevent the line-level craft from reaching an elite standard.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, but its high density of figurative language and abstract nouns ("obsidian grace," "cosmic verse," "latent power") occasionally feels overwrought, slightly slowing momentum. While stylistically consistent, a few more moments of plainer language might have heightened the impact of the most ornate descriptions, particularly around the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmic but trends towards overwriting, with a very high density of figurative language that occasionally dulls momentum. Some sentences feel top-heavy with abstraction ("weaving a tapestry of revelation"). While generally clear, the sheer volume of metaphors and elevated diction slightly obscures the simple, powerful core action, preventing the prose from achieving a state of effortless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is lyrical but suffers from significant overwriting and redundancy. Key concepts like "translating pain," "reflecting deeply," and "enlightening her" are stated and restated in adjacent sentences, creating paraphrase loops that slow momentum. Figurative language is dense but sometimes generic ("velvet expanse"), and the overall effect is one of telling the reader the emotional significance of events multiple times rather than trusting the images to do the work.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is lyrical and often beautiful, with strong rhythmic control. However, it occasionally suffers from high conceptual density, where abstract phrasing ("revitalized the essence of possibility") can feel slightly overwritten and create minor conceptual loops. While stylistically coherent, this density sometimes slows momentum by layering abstractions rather than advancing through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from occasional overwriting and redundancy. Phrases like "silent sentinels harboring the unspoken burdens of the past" lean toward purple prose. The ending features several sentences that paraphrase the same realization, slowing momentum at the moment of closure instead of letting a single, sharp image land.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its imagery. However, there are minor instances of conceptual redundancy, where core ideas (the borrowed heartbeat, the purpose of the lullabies) are re-explained rather than simply shown in action. This creates slight momentum drag in an otherwise fluid and masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally polished and clear, but it suffers from some overwriting and redundancy. The celestial movements are described with several similar phrases (“slow dance,” “languid waltz,” “ponderous ballet”), creating a synonym loop that dulls momentum rather than adding density. This repetition is the primary flaw in an otherwise strong piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it frequently tips into overwriting, particularly in moments of high emotion. The density of figurative language and abstract summary nouns in the final paragraphs ("bloomed in chaos," "stormy absolution") dulls the climactic impact by explaining the emotional and thematic weight of the scene. The deliberate repetition of "fractured grace," while thematically relevant, feels slightly heavy-handed and borders on a prose artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is elegant but marred by significant repetition artifacts. Phrases like "alarming serenity" are used five times, creating a prose loop that dulls momentum and reduces information density. While the language is initially evocative, this recurrence becomes a noticeable scaffold, preventing the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of excellence despite its clarity and rhythmic control elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting and repetition. Key conceptual phrases like "meteor hush" and "half-lit epiphanies" are reused, functioning as prose artifacts that create a looping effect rather than deepening meaning with each use. While individual sentences are well-crafted, the density of figurative language and these recurring tics slightly diminish momentum and clarity, particularly when summarizing the thematic core of the character's change.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a pervasive density that verges on being overwritten. The high frequency of abstract nouns and complex figurative language in nearly every sentence slightly impedes momentum, particularly in the expository sections. While there are no egregious errors, a more disciplined concision would have allowed the story's powerful moments to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose contains moments of striking beauty but is hampered by structural repetition and a tendency towards overwriting. Key phrases like “transcribed memory” and “snowmelt ardor” are looped, which stalls momentum and reads as a prose artifact. The high density of figurative language borders on excessive, occasionally blurring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it suffers from overwriting and a tendency toward stacked, sometimes strained, metaphors ("grunt of ethereal grit"). There are text-artifact loops, notably the repetition of specific adjectival phrases, which clog momentum. While many individual sentences are strong, their density in high-pressure moments occasionally blurs clarity rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and conceptual looping. Words like "dusky," "harmonious," "frugal," and "ironic" are used multiple times, creating a rhythmic monotony and reducing momentum. This pattern of synonym churn and recurring phrasing dulls the impact of an otherwise rich vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a reliance on abstract jargon ("cellular memory," "rhythms of forgotten graces") to explain key events, telling the reader about the change instead of showing it through concrete, embodied detail. This abstraction, particularly at the climax, dulls the emotional impact and momentum of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose, while ambitious, is overwrought and suffers from an excessive density of figurative language that blunts the impact of individual images. In the opening paragraphs, nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor (e.g., "veil of frozen diamonds," "labyrinth of glass-like fragility"), which slows momentum and feels strenuous rather than evocative. There are also moments of conceptual repetition, such as restating the goal of "erasing boundaries," that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there is a tendency toward adjective-heavy constructions and some overwritten phrases ("grief-fogged mind," "hollow expanse") that slightly slow the momentum. The primary flaw is the final two sentences, which lapse into abstract summary and weaken the impact of an otherwise concrete and well-realized scene.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, with strong images like "petals drifted like snow in zero gravity." However, a high density of adjectives and abstract nouns ("impossible vitality," "cosmic desolation," "inscrutable decree") occasionally weighs down the momentum. While the elevated style is consistent, some sentences feel overwrought, sacrificing concision for a dense texture that borders on sluggishness in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, it suffers from a high density of figurative language, bordering on overwriting, especially during the confrontation with the guardian. This concentration of metaphor ("shimmering form," "undulating like a silent overture," "air vibrating with unspoken melodies") slightly muddles the action's clarity and momentum, even while contributing to the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but frequently overwritten, burdened by abstract nouns and conceptual loops that state and then restate the same idea in different terms. Sentences like "...ignite peace from the ashes of her chimeric truth" are a form of scaffolding that explains emotional mechanics instead of letting them play out. This density slows momentum and dulls the impact of otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains evocative descriptions but is hampered by recurring artifacts. The verbatim repetition of "warmly methodical" is a clear loop, and the narrative leans heavily on abstract nouns ("confusion," "clarity," "absence," "complexity") to do the work of concrete imagery. Sentences like "The action was deliberate: to merge the fables' voids with the seal's historical weight" explain intent rather than letting the action itself convey meaning, which slows momentum and dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can feel slightly strenuous ("cracks spidering out like veins of frozen lightning"). There are also minor paraphrase loops, such as restating the nature of her motivation, which could be tightened for greater momentum. The craft is strong, but lacks the final polish of concision.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, it sometimes relies on dense clusters of abstract, high-concept phrasing ("ethereal songs," "lost harmonies," "extinguished dreams," "scattered peace into oblivion") that can feel slightly overwrought. While there are no significant technical errors, a greater emphasis on concrete, sensory detail during key moments would have provided a stronger anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often evocative, the prose is critically hampered by patterned repetition. The recurring use of "deepening hush," "preemptively nostalgic," and "elongated shadow" functions as a prose artifact, dulling momentum and weakening the final impact of these concepts. This systemic looping is a significant flaw for a story aiming at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong sensory details. However, there are occasional moments that lean on familiar phrasing ("weight of his weary soul," "brewed in his mind") that slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. These instances are minor and do not disrupt momentum, but they prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier of flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it is held back by a consistent pattern of overwriting and conceptual repetition. Core terms like "texture of time," "transition periods," and "tangential" are used too frequently, feeling like scaffold from a prompt. While individually strong, the high density of figurative language and philosophical statements slightly dulls the momentum and can feel overwrought.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it carries minor artifacts that impede momentum. There are several paraphrase loops or near-duplicates, such as explaining how to "make silences sprout" twice with very similar phrasing ("limiting exposure"). The phrase "stretching contracted tone" is also awkward and unclear, momentarily breaking the otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is evocative and rhythmic, with strong imagery that builds a compelling atmosphere. While the high density of figurative language is generally effective, a few sentences feel slightly overwritten or fall into summary, like "Elias monitored the noise levels meticulously, noting how..." This slightly interrupts the otherwise immersive flow, creating minor textural scuffs in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is generally clear and often vivid, but it's hampered by recurring artifacts. There is a tendency towards modifier stacking ("neon-veiled spires," "wisely adventurous soul") and paraphrase loops that state an idea and then immediately explain it. A key example occurs at the climax: "Elara's wisely adventurous spirit surged; this was her moment to sally forth, to charge into the unknown with calculated bravery," which dulls the impact of the action by over-narrating the internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.0)
    While the prose is often evocative, it suffers from a significant text artifact: keyword repetition. Terms like "encroach," "tender," "suffocating," and "loaded emptiness" are overused, creating a looping, mechanical feel that dulls their impact. This verbal insistence makes the story feel reverse-engineered from a list of concepts rather than flowing organically.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it leans heavily into overwriting, with figurative language ("weaving seams of wonder," "enveloping her like a velvet cloak") appearing in almost every descriptive passage. This density, while atmospheric, occasionally slows momentum and muddles clarity with abstract concepts. Several sentences exhibit a template cadence ("The mushrooms glowed..., their caps pulsing..., that whispered secrets..."), a common artifact that can flatten rhythm. The craft is strong, but a more economical and varied approach would increase propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is rhythmically competent but suffers from significant line-level artifacts that would require revision before publication. There are multiple instances of paraphrase loops and keyword repetition ("golden shadows," "eloquently silent," "muse"). This synonym churn and reliance on a few key phrases create a sense of overwriting and reduce the prose's precision and momentum, particularly dulling the impact of otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant text-artifact issues, primarily conceptual loops and repetitive phrasing. Key phrases like "shivering bliss," "capture the shape of possibility," and "reality shifted" are used multiple times, functioning as a template cadence that dulls momentum and reduces information density. While some lines are evocative, this pervasive repetition is a major flaw that weighs down an otherwise strong narrative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum. However, it occasionally relies on well-worn phrases ("echoing with the ghosts," "sigh from the past") that slightly soften its impact. While free of major artifacts or syntactic loops, the line-level craft lacks the consistent, surprising sharpness required for the highest tier of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally polished and evocative, with strong verbs and a consistent rhythm. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that can slow momentum. The final two paragraphs shift into a more summary-like mode, which flattens the prose and feels less immediate than the tense action preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often evocative and rhythmically strong, it is significantly weakened by a pattern of repetitive phrasing. Key terms like "eerie nostalgia," "quietly vivid," "vested hush," and "negative space" are reused four times each, functioning like conceptual labels rather than organic descriptions. This text-artifact creates a loop that dulls the impact of the language and feels less like intentional motif and more like a mechanical reinforcement, preventing the prose from achieving a truly flawless, publishable state.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    While the prose is often evocative, it suffers from overwriting and repetitive phrasing that functions as a prose artifact. The recurring phrase "mossy delight" (and its variants) appears too frequently, losing its power and becoming a tic. The high density of figurative language in nearly every sentence occasionally clutters the narrative rather than clarifying it, slowing momentum at key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally evocative and clear, but there are moments of overwriting and scaffolding that hold it back. Phrases like "coincidences had begun to weave into patterns" contain a slight redundancy. The sentence introducing "uncertainly certain" is a notable text artifact, an abstract clump that stalls momentum. These instances, while not pervasive, slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose contains several artifacts that reduce momentum and clarity. There are paraphrase loops ("To understand the weight of names...") and sentences that summarize intent rather than dramatizing action ("He intended to redeem that failure..."). While generally evocative, this tendency towards telling and repetition dulls the story's propulsive force.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought. The most significant flaw is the repetition of the key phrase "luminous ache" three times, which functions as a text artifact that loses power with each use and dulls the story's key emotional beats. While generally clear, the prose lacks the concision and restraint expected at the highest level, prioritizing lushness over sharp impact.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is generally sharp, with vivid imagery and a strong rhythmic sense. However, in several key moments, the language becomes overly abstract and conceptual ("penance manifesting as a warm calculus," "mercy as an algorithm"). This tendency toward high-register, explanatory phrasing slightly dulls the immediacy of the emotional beats, particularly at the climax, where the experience is described more than it is purely felt.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and evocative, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, the story suffers from the repeated use of specific, abstract jargon like "anchors of intuition" and "elusively tangible." These terms feel like imposed conceptual labels rather than organic language, creating a slight scholastic distance and periodically disrupting the otherwise immersive flow with a hint of template cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and propulsive. However, there are moments of slight overwriting and scaffolding, such as labeling Elias's ability ("his skillfully observant eyes") rather than letting the action carry the meaning alone. Phrasing like "ethereal heaviness that pressed without mass, like regrets carried on a breeze" is functional but verges on the abstract where a more concrete sensory detail would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often achieves moments of beauty, but it suffers from a relentless density of figurative language that verges on overwriting. This constant high register flattens the story's dynamics and occasionally creates conceptual redundancies, such as in the explanation of "rustling awakenings." While artful, the piece would be stronger with more concision and moments of plain-spoken clarity to anchor the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it is hampered by significant overwriting. The density of figurative language is exceedingly high ("twisted like forgotten sonnets," "frozen tears," "sorrowful winds"), which can sometimes blur meaning rather than sharpen it. There are also moments of near-redundancy that slow the momentum. While the quality of individual phrases is high, the overall effect lacks concision and rhythmic variety, feeling effortful in places.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.5)
    While ambitious, the prose is frequently overwritten, with a density of figurative language that sometimes clutters rather than clarifies ("alchemizing corrosion into gleaming resolve"). This tendency toward ornate, abstract phrasing weighs down the momentum, especially during what should be tense moments. The piece lacks the concision and line-level propulsion expected for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it relies on repetitive phrasing, notably "resonant hush" and "hinged awakening," which function as scaffolding rather than organic description. This repetition, combined with the abstract summary in the final beats, creates a slight drag on momentum. While the line-level craft is generally strong, these recurring artifacts dull the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition of key thematic phrases. "Perpetually learning," "scaffold complexity with simplicity," and "turbine-hum reverie" are used like refrains, creating a scaffold-like structure that feels mechanical. These loops dull momentum and give the impression that the story is checking off conceptual beats rather than letting them flow from the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it is marked by repetitive phrasing that feels like a prose artifact. Key terms like "quietly driven," "reckon with," and "umbral tenderness" are used multiple times, creating a slight template cadence that dulls their initial impact. While the rhythm is generally strong, these loops create minor momentum drags in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it occasionally suffers from overwriting and repetition that dulls its impact. The phrase "searing reverie" is used three times, functioning more as a label than an evolving sensation. The high density of adjectives, while creating atmosphere, sometimes slows momentum in what should be high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally well-paced, with strong images like lanterns as "forgotten dreams" and the mind as a "forge." However, it occasionally slips into less artful, more direct statements that summarize intent, such as "He knew the action required was to conceive a new beginning..." These moments of scaffolding slightly reduce the prose's momentum and information density, holding it back from top-tier execution.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, but it occasionally slips into overwriting and authorial summary. The line "Unbeknownst to him, this utterance was no mere archive; it was an accidental prophecy..." is a significant intrusion that tells the reader what to conclude. Similarly, summarizing the prophecy's fulfillment over several days blunts the momentum of the final beat, choosing telling over a more powerful, immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is critically flawed by prominent text artifacts. The triple repetitions of "furiously tranquil" and "wild serenity," alongside paraphrase loops ("a storm of urgency quelled by deep inner peace"), create a recursive, over-written quality that obstructs momentum. These loops are the single greatest weakness preventing this piece from being publishable as-is.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean and controlled, but it frequently defaults to telling instead of showing, particularly with character motivation ("his true motivation was to favor listening over noise"). Several phrases verge on cliché ("whispered secrets to ancient stone walls," "dangling like a lifeline"). The most significant issue is the final paragraph's direct summary of the theme, which is a structural craft problem that sacrifices resonant imagery for didacticism.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean but marred by repetitive phrasing and conceptual loops that function as scaffolding. Key thematic phrases like "hush of this overlooked era" and "primal elegance" are recycled, dulling their impact. This repetition creates momentum drag and gives the prose a templated feel, particularly when adjacent sentences restate the same idea in slightly different words.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, but it is hampered by occasional scaffolding and declarative sentences that state what could be shown. Constructions like "it was his motivation... that compelled him" and the label "Through contextual clues..." are minor artifacts that disrupt the otherwise seamless flow. While there are no major loops, these moments of inelegance slightly reduce the overall propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and generally well-crafted. However, there are instances of overwriting, particularly in moments of high conceptual density, such as the list of metaphors at the end ("the rough silk of seconds, the gritty drag of hours..."). Some phrasing feels slightly redundant ("whispers of anticipated mysteries"), and the final beat uses some scaffold-like language ("mysteries no longer anticipated but embraced") that could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently elegant and evocative, marked by strong verb choices and fresh imagery. However, its high figurative density occasionally verges on overwriting, slightly impeding momentum in a few key moments. There is also a minor prose artifact where summary follows description (e.g., describing the drake's wounds, then stating it was "incomplete in its glory"), a small redundancy that could be tightened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally elegant, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, there are minor but noticeable text artifacts that detract from its polish. The sentence "The diary wasn't just a record; it held clues..." is a common scaffolding construction. There is also some slight template cadence in the description of his work ("He retrieved... He started... Methodically, he wrapped..."). These are small blemishes on an otherwise strong piece of writing, but they prevent it from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with a high density of evocative imagery and precise word choice. There are no significant technical flaws, loops, or distracting artifacts. However, at times the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought, and some phrasing tends towards abstraction ("elusive alchemy of bonds—molecular and emotional") where a more concrete rendering would have been stronger, slightly dulling the immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is rich and evocative, with strong imagery and a deliberate rhythm. However, it occasionally tips into being overwritten, with dense clusters of adjectives and elevated descriptors that feel slightly strained ("narrow vastness," "submerged fury," "avian syntax"). While generally clear and propulsive, a few moments of this figurative density momentarily slow the momentum by drawing attention to the prose itself.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting, with a relentless density of figurative language that often dulls momentum rather than sharpens it. Stock prompt phrases like "intuitively descriptive" and "tinted revelations" are inserted without being fully integrated into the narrative fabric. The result is a piece that feels stylistically labored, where the craft calls attention to itself at the expense of clear, propulsive storytelling, especially in moments that demand immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is generally evocative but is significantly undermined by two key flaws. Firstly, the phrase "echoed silence" is repeated six times, becoming a distracting prose artifact. More critically, pivotal moments of character change are summarized rather than shown (e.g., "confusion started to morph into exploration"), which dulls the impact of the climax and violates the story's otherwise strong "show, don't tell" approach.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant artifacts, most notably the verbatim repetition of the phrase "cautious abandon" three times, which creates a distracting loop. The writing is frequently overwritten, with a high density of adjectives and adverbs that tell the reader how to feel rather than showing the action. This reliance on summary-labels over concrete, sensory detail ultimately dulls the story's momentum and immediacy, particularly during moments of supposed high tension.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it frequently tips into overwriting. A high density of abstract nouns and multisyllabic adjectives ("nomadic penumbra," "luminous threads in the penumbral dusk") creates a clotted texture that can slow momentum. While evocative, the language sometimes calls more attention to itself than to the action, lacking the concision needed to make the peak moments land with maximum force.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density. While the language is consistently strong, a few figurative phrases verge on the familiar ("cradle of ancient tomes," "storm-tossed sea"), slightly softening the impact of otherwise sharp prose. However, the critical final beats are clear and powerful, and there are no momentum-killing artifacts or loops, keeping the piece in a very high band of execution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and demonstrates strong control, but it is hampered by repetition of key phrases ("fierce repose," "fidgeted productively") that begin to feel like authorial labels rather than organic motifs. There are also minor paraphrase loops, such as the multiple descriptions of the tapestry's silencing effect. The final paragraph contains several sentences that summarize the thematic resolution, slightly reducing the momentum and impact of the final image. These artifacts, while not severe, prevent the prose from achieving full propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and confident, with a strong rhythmic control that sustains the story's ethereal tone. The figurative language is dense but largely effective. The craft is slightly marred by the repetitive use of key descriptors ("defiant," "forged hush," "innocently mischievous"), which function almost as labels and create minor scaffold-like echoes across the text.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it suffers from a tendency towards overwriting, with dense clusters of figurative language that occasionally blur clarity. Phrases like "quilting memories together into a cohesive tapestry" are abstract summaries rather than concrete actions. This pattern of stating the thematic effect alongside the action creates a slight drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally evocative, but it occasionally dips into overwriting and summary. Phrases like "suspended in a bubble of infinite now, fleeting yet endless" are redundant, and the transformation is partly summarized ("Elias emerged from the caves transformed"). The line that explicitly states the theme is also a line-level flaw, functioning as authorial scaffolding rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose has a good rhythm but is hampered by overwriting and repetitive phrasing. Figurative language is often dense and contradictory, as seen in "screaming tenderness." Some sentences restate the same idea in slightly different terms, slowing momentum. While the language aims for poetic intensity, its lack of concision and occasional muddled metaphors obscure clarity in key emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is held back by minor but noticeable scaffolding. The direct statement of the navigator's motivation is a paraphrase loop of the preceding sentence, and the repetition of key descriptors like "raw" slightly dulls their impact. While the line-level craft is strong, these small redundancies prevent the prose from achieving true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it occasionally tips into overwriting, with dense clusters of figurative language that slow momentum ("swollen into unbearable torrents," "fractured tapestry," "bruised sky"). There is also a minor paraphrase loop in the final paragraph, where "forged safety not through lies, but through honest occlusion" restates the core action immediately before the metaphoric summary. These artifacts slightly detract from an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and rhythmic but suffers from overwriting and repetition. The density of figurative language sometimes blurs rather than sharpens images ("gleamed like fractured gems, veiled in a perpetual mist"). More significantly, the recycling of the phrase "softly persistent" is a noticeable prose artifact that interrupts the narrative flow and feels programmatic.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is marred by a significant prose artifact: the repetitive use of "empirically intuitive" and its variations. This phrase acts as a scaffold, feeling like an authorial directive rather than an organic part of the narrative voice. This loop appears multiple times, creating a mechanical feel that detracts from an otherwise strong piece, triggering a penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose aims for a lush, evocative style but frequently slips into overwriting, reducing its impact. Figurative language is over-stacked in high-pressure moments (e.g., "skies weeping bleeding starlight," "starlight hemorrhaging from celestial wounds"), which dulls momentum. The primary weakness is the presence of prose artifacts: the template-like repetition of "softly commanding" and "lacy menace" functions as a loop, and some adjacent phrases feel like synonym churn ("revelation or ruin"). These issues, particularly in the final third, prevent the prose from achieving the clarity and propulsion it needs.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose demonstrates strong rhythmic control and deliberate word choice. However, it suffers from overwriting; the density of figurative language is so high in every paragraph that it sometimes obscures action and emotion. There is also conceptual redundancy, with phrases like "density of presence," "weight of every glance," and "compressing...into this singular point" serving as synonym churn that slows momentum rather than deepening meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Momentum is generally well-maintained. The primary weakness is a recurring-concept loop; key phrases like "feral nostalgia," "jaded wonder," and "distill chaos" are repeated almost verbatim, functioning as thematic signposts that feel slightly redundant and scaffold-like, particularly near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often evocative, it suffers from a recurring prose artifact: the repeated naming of its own abstract concepts ("occluded views," "trembling calm," "maps the emotional terrain," "unveil ordinary miracles"). This scaffold-like phrasing creates a template cadence that feels overly constructed. The final paragraph also drifts into summary ("reminding them both that life's flow persists..."), which slightly dulls the impact of the concluding image.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and imbued with strong imagery, but it is held back by minor instances of scaffolding. The line "her motivation clear: to transform scars into stories, turning the jagged wounds of her past into runes..." is a paraphrase loop that states the same idea twice. While the overall quality is very high, such redundancies slightly blunt the precision of an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.4)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by an over-density of figurative language, particularly during the climax. The relentless cascade of similes ("like old grudges," "like a candle," "like storm clouds," "like static") creates a sense of overwriting that can dull the impact of individual images. This stylistic tic, while consistent, sometimes sacrifices precision and momentum for decorative effect.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that can feel overwrought. Several sentences are laden with multiple abstract concepts, which occasionally slows momentum. For instance, the definition of "Illusion" reads more like a thematic statement than a dictionary entry, creating a slight register drift. The craft is strong, but a touch more concision would heighten its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, key moments rely on cliché ("realization dawning") and some phrasing feels slightly overwritten ("symphony of revelation"). The word "eminently" is repeated in a way that draws attention to itself, and the final paragraph summarizes the character's change rather than conveying it through a final, sharp image.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it occasionally relies on high-concept metaphors that feel slightly overwritten, such as the recurring "quiet wildfire." There are minor instances of scaffolding ("This gift had always served her well...") and phrases that carry more abstract weight than the moment has earned ("her words carrying the weight of unspoken histories"). These instances slightly dull the otherwise strong momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is often elegant, but it is hampered by recurrent conceptual scaffolding that reads like prompt language ("theoretically rebellious," "responsible expansion," "lucid contradictions"). These abstract labels disrupt the otherwise strong flow and imagery. This tendency toward conceptual summary over concrete embodiment is most damaging at the climax, where it dulls the impact of the final realization.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains evocative imagery but is hampered by abstraction and redundancy. Phrases like "a cultivated estrangement" and "intimacy without permanence" summarize concepts rather than dramatizing them. The description of the "verbal loop" is conceptually unclear and feels more asserted than shown. This reliance on summary, especially in explaining the story's mechanics, creates momentum drag and undermines the "show, don't tell" principle.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often evocative and sensory, particularly in its description of the setting and ink. However, the piece is significantly marred by repetitive phrasing and text artifacts. The phrase "proximate cause" is used three times, and "gently thorough" appears twice; this scaffolding reads like a template and stalls momentum. This mechanical repetition, especially of the core concepts, prevents the prose from achieving the flawlessness required for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of publishable quality, demonstrating exceptional rhythm, clarity, and information density. Figurative language is fresh and integrated, as seen in "cracked platforms like polite invaders excusing their overgrowth." The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or overwriting, and every sentence works to propel the narrative and deepen the atmosphere with concision and grace.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong momentum. Lines like "illuminated his grief without consuming him" are exceptional. The score is held back only by a few minor instances of overwriting, such as the slightly familiar "stormy sea" or "spiders on silk," which momentarily soften the otherwise sharp and original prose.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often evocative and displays strong imagery. However, it is hampered by occasional redundancies and paraphrase loops, such as "unbend the twisted path of events, straightening the bent timeline." This tendency to restate concepts slightly dilutes the momentum and information density, particularly in moments that should be sharp and decisive. The line-level craft is strong but lacks the final polish of concision.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often beautiful, but it's hampered by minor but persistent issues. There's some reliance on stock phrasing ("glowed like liquid silver") and adjectival telling where showing would be stronger (the repetition of "quietly charismatic"). A few sentences state emotional content that has just been dramatized, creating small paraphrase loops, such as explaining the meaning of "joyful sorrow" after introducing the term.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is the story's most significant weakness, suffering from overwriting and noticeable repetition. The phrase "volcanic tenderness" and its variants are used as a crutch, dulling the impact through lexical loops. While grammatically sound, the reliance on dense, sometimes clichéd figurative language often slows momentum and obscures the emotional core it seeks to illuminate.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it consistently operates at a very high figurative density, which occasionally borders on overwriting. Phrases like "shimmering hues," "ethereal flowers," and "auroral sorrow" are stacked closely, sometimes dulling momentum. There is also minor conceptual repetition around the "shared dream," which could be sharpened for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally effective, with some strong imagery related to the storm and the labyrinth. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting and relies on familiar constructions ("casual yet precise," "howling wind"). There are no significant technical errors, and the momentum is well-maintained, but the line-level craft lacks the consistent sharpness, economy, and rhythmic invention that would mark it as exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose successfully creates atmosphere, it suffers from severe text-artifact issues that would require heavy editing. The mechanical repetition of phrases—"stillwater tension" (4 times), "half-spoken secret" (4 times), "spiralingly calm" (3 times)—creates a looped, template-like cadence that dulls momentum. This redundancy is the story's most significant flaw at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative but suffers from occasional overwriting and redundancy. There are several instances of paraphrase loops (e.g., "plant forests of second thoughts, sowing seeds of reflection") that state the same idea twice, slowing momentum. While the imagery is strong, a more concise execution would heighten the story's propulsive quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. However, the figurative language is occasionally so dense in the opening paragraphs that it risks becoming overwrought. The repetition of the key phrase "combative tenderness" three times, while thematically central, feels slightly declarative and could be trusted more to the subtext established by the excellent scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with strong verbs and resonant imagery ("blades slicing the air like indifferent sentinels"). The rhythm is controlled, accelerating with the narration and settling back into the quiet hum of the turbines. The piece is nearly flawless, held back only by a few instances of thematic assertion that feel slightly less crafted than the surrounding sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is significantly overwrought, suffering from conceptual loops and repetitive phrasing that dulls momentum. Thematic keywords are recycled to the point of becoming scaffolding. Lines like "This was it—the core concept he had chased in every poem" are a critical flaw, substituting direct summary for dramatization and breaking the narrative spell at a peak moment.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by several artifacts that slow momentum. The story relies on telling over showing for core traits ("His motivation burned...") and repeats the label "innocently cunning" in a way that functions as a scaffold. The final paragraphs shift from dramatization to a summary that explicitly states the thematic resolution, dulling the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose successfully establishes atmosphere but is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting and some repetitive sentence structures. The density of figurative language can feel strained, and phrases are occasionally recycled ("powerfully gentle"). While clear, the line-level craft lacks the sharpness and economy required for the highest tier, showing signs of scaffolding that could be streamlined for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with strong word choice and varied sentence structures that support the story's ethereal atmosphere. The line-level craft is generally very clean, with high information density. There is a minor instance of a paraphrase loop ("genuinely artificial" is immediately followed by "artificial yet pulsing with authentic life"), but it does not significantly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, but it is significantly weakened by the repetitive use of key prompt phrases ("inherited mystery," "steadily curious," "multiplying paths"). This scaffold-like repetition feels artificial and disrupts momentum, reading as authorial reinforcement rather than organic narrative. This recurring prose artifact prevents the story from reaching the highest tier of literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, rich, and highly stylized, yet remains clear and purposeful, advancing the story with every line. Figurative language is inventive and generally coherent, creating a vivid, immersive experience. While the style verges on overwriting, it consistently serves the story's accumulative design and mythic tone, demonstrating remarkable control and avoiding common prose artifacts like loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, with strong imagery ("visions flowed like rivers between souls"). However, the piece is marked by a noticeable prose artifact: the phrase "softly deliberate" appears three times, creating a repetitive loop that slightly undermines the otherwise varied rhythm. This repetition, while thematically adjacent, functions as scaffolding and detracts from the overall polish required for the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery like "paper curling like dead leaves in the mist." However, there are minor instances of conceptual redundancy and scaffolding. For example, "reconstruct his shattered sense of purpose, to piece back together the man he'd been" is a paraphrase loop that slightly slows momentum. These small artifacts are infrequent but keep the line-level craft just shy of flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose demonstrates ambition and creates a strong mood, but is hampered by moments of overwriting and redundancy. Phrases like "meteor hush, that profound silence following a celestial streak" feature explanatory clauses that weaken the initial image. There are also instances of synonym churn ("read the stories... decipher the hidden narratives"), which reduce information density and slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting. There is a recurring conceptual loop around "hushed thunder," used multiple times in slightly different phrasing, which dulls its impact. Figurative language is dense, sometimes creating mixed metaphors ("tone of hushed thunder") that obscure clarity and slow momentum, particularly in moments of supposed revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is overwrought in key moments. Figurative language is stacked so densely ("veils... danced like forgotten promises," "framed... like a lover's embrace," "burned like a hidden flame," "kissing her skin like a lover's secret touch") that it verges on purple prose, slightly dulling the impact through excess. There are also minor instances of paraphrase loops, such as restating her creativity is "trapped," "stifled," and "entombed."

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("pulsed like forgotten heartbeats," "waking fireflies"). However, there are occasional moments where the density of figurative language becomes slightly overwrought or a word choice feels strained ("methoded"). These are minor issues in an otherwise polished piece, but they slightly impede the story's propulsion in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it is held back by minor but noticeable artifacts. There is a repetitive template cadence in the middle ("First, he approached... Next, he translocated... Finally... he found himself") that feels mechanical. Additionally, some phrases slightly overwrite the concept, such as layering "hum of insight," "subtle vibration," and "frequency where revelations resonated" in close succession.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, but it is marked by a noticeable pattern of thematic repetition. Key phrases like "gently persistent," "shoreline lullaby," and "indirect routes" are reused multiple times, which, while creating motifs, also reads like a template cadence. This artifact slightly dulls the line-level momentum and freshness.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, but it suffers from occasional overwriting and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "That silence was no mere absence of sound; it was a sin unforgiven" are followed by further explanation, creating a paraphrase loop that slows momentum. The frequent use of abstract, compound descriptors ("silent-choir bellhop," "seraphically mundane") feels more like authorial labeling than organic prose, slightly dulling the line-level propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.2)
    While often evocative, the prose suffers from a relentless density of figurative language and modifiers that borders on overwriting. The momentum is occasionally slowed by phrases that explain their own symbolism, such as "symbolizing the elegant unraveling of knowledge's grand facade." Greater concision and trust in the power of the core images would have allowed the story's inherent elegance to shine more brightly.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery. At key moments, however, it slips into summarizing the process of discovery rather than dramatizing it (e.g., "the revelation delayed as layers peeled back slowly"). This slightly dulls the momentum and immediacy of what should be the story's most tense sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and overwriting that dulls its impact. Key phrases like “awkwardly confident” and “thunderous serenity” are repeated verbatim, functioning as scaffolding. Several sentences are paraphrase-loops, restating information without advancing the narrative, which slows momentum and points to a lack of concision at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clear but suffers from a few key issues. Figurative language is often ornamental and relies on stock comparisons ("symbols twisting like roots"). The final two paragraphs break momentum by shifting into a summary of future events ("Word of her act spread... In the years that followed"), which deflates the tension of the climax. This shift from showing to telling is a significant flaw in an otherwise pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details. However, several moments rely on cliché ("sky rained fire") or thematic labels that read like authorial summary ("a symbol of peace forged in adversity"). The phrase "through somatic markers, those instinctive bodily cues" is a notable instance of telling that uses clinical language, which slightly disrupts the immersive, literary feel of the scene and creates a minor momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose contains strong, evocative imagery but is hampered by recurring artifacts. The repeated use of "ache" and "aching" (five times) slightly dulls its effect. More significantly, the string of rhetorical questions creates a template cadence that disrupts the narrative flow. This syntactic monotony, especially in moments of high tension, functions as a scaffold for thematic delivery rather than prose that propels the scene forward.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, with strong opening and closing images. However, there is a recurring tendency to stack figurative language ("simmered in his veins like a distant storm," "tightened like a bowstring") which occasionally verges on overwriting. A minor paraphrase loop ("anger was serene, a calm rage") also slightly impedes momentum early on, preventing the prose from reaching the highest tier of economy and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose contains some evocative imagery but is severely flawed by repetitive phrasing. The phrase "dizzying quiet" appears six times, creating a prose loop that dulls its impact and stalls momentum. Similar repetitions of "contraband truths" and "bravely conflicted" function as scaffolding rather than purposeful prose. These artifacts read like synonym churn or template cadence, making the line-level craft feel unpolished and undermining the story's literary aspirations.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and evocative, but it is overwrought with conceptual density. Key abstract phrases ("engraved quiet," "continuity") are repeated, functioning as thematic labels that create a slight conceptual loop. While the sentences are well-formed, this repetition of high-concept terms slightly dulls the narrative momentum, giving parts of the story an essayistic rather than immersive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often beautiful, its unrelenting density of figurative language becomes a weakness. Nearly every sentence contains a new metaphor or simile, which creates a rich texture but ultimately weighs down the narrative momentum and feels overwrought. This stylistic choice, particularly phrases like "feral lullaby, wild and soothing," occasionally results in near-paraphrase loops that blunt the precision of an otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by recurring scaffold phrases and paraphrase loops. The repetition of key descriptors ("devotedly observant," "solemn playfulness," "hidden truths") feels heavy-handed, and adjacent sentences occasionally restate the same idea ("The call had ignited this revelation..." followed by "...the catalyst..."). These artifacts slightly dull the story's momentum and narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from severe overwriting, with a near-constant barrage of metaphors and similes that often obscure rather than clarify ("ghostly algorithms reaching out like invisible threads," "voice like falling stars"). This high density of figurative language in almost every sentence dulls momentum and feels performative, particularly during high-pressure beats. The line-level craft is technically clean, but its stylistic excess is the story's most significant flaw, creating a sense of conceptual clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and maintains a strong rhythm, but its high density of figurative language occasionally borders on overwriting. There is also a minor paraphrase loop in the description of Elara's social perceptiveness ("She was socially perceptive... her keen senses picking up the unease... Her social perceptiveness sharpened..."). While the line-level craft is strong overall, these small instances of imprecision hold it back from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from overwriting and conceptual looping. The same core ideas are rephrased multiple times, creating redundancy that slows momentum (e.g., the various descriptions of instilling empathy). The reliance on key labels like "warm coldness" feels like a scaffold, telling the reader the intended effect rather than creating it through varied, concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often beautiful and evocative, with strong sensory imagery. However, it occasionally slips into overwriting with dense, multi-clause sentences that slow momentum. The final sentence is a key weakness, functioning as a summary that paraphrases the story's resolution and slightly dulls the impact of the preceding scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful but suffers from overwriting. The density of figurative language is too high, with phrases like "willowglass thin and resilient, bending like supple branches yet transparent as polished panes" feeling ornate and slowing momentum. The repetition of keywords like "fractal" and "illuminate" becomes a noticeable prose artifact that slightly dulls the story's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose contains striking images, it's hampered by a recurring pattern of showing a wondrous event and immediately telling the scientific explanation ("...seemed enchanted but was grounded in quantum mechanics"). This preemptive explaining deflates the mystery and slows momentum. Additionally, minor paraphrase loops concerning the protagonist's motivation appear in the opening, making the line-level craft less propulsive than it could be.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous, with strong verbs and specific, evocative imagery. However, its density sometimes verges on overwriting, and a few key moments rely on abstraction where concrete detail would be stronger. The primary flaw is the thematic summary near the end, which breaks from the established poetic voice into declarative prose, momentarily disrupting the narrative momentum right before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it is marred by conspicuous repetition. Key phrases like "silver hush," "prudently daring," "tilting earth," and "unused courage" are reused to the point of becoming thematic scaffolding rather than organic elements. This looping reduces the prose's momentum and gives it a slightly artificial, formulaic quality, preventing it from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains moments of genuine beauty, but it is frequently marred by overwriting and a reliance on abstract conceptual language where concrete action would be stronger. Phrases like "distill complexity into essence" function as thematic scaffolding that should have been removed. The line-level craft suffers from telling pivotal moments of insight rather than dramatizing them through sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, with strong, resonant imagery. However, the high density of figurative language occasionally feels overwrought, slightly slowing momentum rather than propelling it. While there are no significant errors, a few phrases like "sharp gentleness...tender persistence" border on synonym-looping, creating a textural richness that is just shy of being fully disciplined and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable prose artifacts that prevent it from reaching the highest tier. There is repetitive phrasing ("wistfully pragmatic" used three times, "quivering hush" three times) and a near-paraphrase loop ("the quivering hush settled over the harbor—a tense, expectant silence"). These recurrences slightly dull the momentum and feel more like authorial insistence than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is often evocative but is hampered by a reliance on abstract nominalizations ("profound loneliness," "fierce independence," "fragile resurgence") that can feel ponderous. There is also a minor paraphrase loop in the description of the "brittle awakenings." Phrasing like "atomically reflective" creates a slight register clash with the story's fantasy tone.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is frequently beautiful and imaginative, but it suffers from a pervasive overwriting that values lyricism over momentum. The density of figurative language is consistently high, which can feel decorative and bog down the pacing. This tendency culminates in the final paragraph, which is laden with abstractions ("universal thread," "shared truth," "hidden weave") instead of landing on a sharp, concrete image.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with virtually no wasted words or line-level artifacts. Sentence structures are varied and the language is consistently evocative, contributing significantly to the "ethereal grit" atmosphere. Figurative language, such as the tricksters' power unraveling "like frayed threads in the void," is both fresh and thematically coherent, enhancing clarity rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from significant overwriting, particularly a high density of adjectives and adverbs that dulls momentum. There are numerous instances of synonym churn (rebellion, mutiny, defiance) and paraphrase loops that restate concepts without adding new information. This lexical density clutters the narrative, especially during the climax, reducing the clarity and impact of the key actions and transformations.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=5.8)
    While containing some strong imagery, the prose is burdened by significant scaffolding and repetition. The word "methodical" appears three times in the first few paragraphs, and phrases like "unify opposites" are used like a mantra. This redundancy, combined with abstract constructions ("the chaos of decay with the order of art"), slows momentum and over-explains concepts that should be demonstrated through action.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is evocative, but its momentum is dragged down by significant text-artifact issues. The phrase "nervously confident" appears four times, and "spongey dread" appears four times; this looping paraphrases Elara’s state rather than evolving it, violating the "show, don't tell" principle through sheer repetition. This synonym churn dulls the impact of otherwise strong descriptive work and is the story's most significant line-level flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.0)
    The prose contains some striking images, but it is hampered by repetition of key conceptual phrases that function as scaffolding ("luminous disbelief," "dynamically observant"). The high density of figurative language sometimes muddles clarity rather than enhancing it. There's a tendency toward overwriting, where the sentence-level craft calls attention to itself at the expense of narrative momentum and character authenticity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, but it sometimes strains for effect, resulting in overwritten passages ("as if the dusk itself lent him its harmonious hush"). There are also several instances of paraphrase loops, where an idea is stated and then immediately restated in slightly different terms (e.g., describing his calm). The final paragraph's shift into direct thematic summary is a significant line-level flaw that weakens the story's momentum at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is clean but tends toward abstraction and overwriting at key moments, choosing to tell emotional states rather than showing them through concrete action. Phrases like "an inner illumination piercing the midnight" and "words woven from empathy" are conceptual shortcuts. This reliance on summary over scene dulls the impact of the climax and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, with vivid imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, there are minor instances of conceptual redundancy, particularly around the core trait of "warlike serenity," which is restated in several similar ways. The line explaining the parallel ("not just the ice, but her own rigid guardedness") slightly undermines the metaphor by explaining it, briefly stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it consistently borders on being overwritten, with figurative language packed so densely that it occasionally slows momentum. There are minor prose artifacts, such as paraphrase loops (e.g., the two-part description of her curiosity). While rhythmically controlled, the sentences could benefit from greater concision to sharpen the impact of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often evocative, with strong imagery. However, it is significantly weakened by prose artifacts, specifically the repetitive use of key descriptive phrases (e.g., "reckless" appears four times, "half-lit corridors" three times). This looping creates a scaffold-like effect that an editor would immediately flag, dulling the impact of otherwise strong writing and preventing the piece from feeling polished and seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong images like the "starlit scars" on the grille cloth. However, a few moments rely on cliché ("humiliation stung," "memories flooded back"). More significantly, the climactic epiphany is delivered through summary ("he realized..."), a moment of telling where showing would have been more powerful, slightly dulling the propulsive energy built up to that point.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains some lovely imagery, but it is hampered by repetition and scaffolding. The phrase "kindly methodical" is used three times, becoming a label rather than an observation. Similarly, concepts like "touching distance" and "physics of transition" are repeated, which feels like a prose loop. These artifacts, while not breaking causality, dull the momentum and create a sense of being guided by the author's hand rather than immersed in the character's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, there are minor instances of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly redundant, such as the repeated "serene" glow of the "winter sun." Phrases like "contradictions incarnate" feel slightly less organic than the surrounding prose. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished and highly effective piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear but relies on repetitive phrasing, with "resonant hush," "latent radiance," and "heartbeat of a hesitation" recurring to the point of becoming prose artifacts rather than powerful motifs. Some sentences tend toward abstraction ("bridging the silence with shared humanity") where a more concrete image would have been stronger. The overall effect is competent but lacks the sharp, varied rhythm of exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding and paraphrase loops, particularly when interpreting the graffiti. The line "wisdom imparted through these anonymous scratches" restates what is already evident, momentarily slowing momentum and diluting the information density of an otherwise crisp narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but hampered by overwriting and repetition, which dulls momentum. Adjective-heavy phrases and recurring conceptual labels (e.g., "cautious exuberance," "fateful letter") create density without propulsion. The line "love withheld' became 'dlehhtiw evol'" is a particularly clunky moment of showing that feels more like telling, breaking the otherwise ethereal mood.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=6.9)
    While often evocative, the prose suffers from overwriting and a density that can impede momentum. There are several instances of paraphrase loops, such as the two descriptions of the amulet's fading light, which are redundant. The lush, figurative language is a strength but at times becomes a thicket of stacked modifiers and repeating motifs that dulls precision.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunningly beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. However, it suffers from noticeable repetition of key thematic words, particularly "hush" (6 times) and "stillness" (4 times), and the phrase "lucidly watchful" (twice). This verbal looping, while tonally consistent, functions as a prose artifact that slightly dulls the momentum and impact, especially in such a short piece.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally clear but leans toward overwriting, with a density of figurative language that sometimes feels ornate rather than purposeful ("shadows danced like whispers"). There are moments of slight redundancy, and the momentum is dampened by the summarizing nature of the final paragraph. While functional, the line-level craft could be more concise and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it suffers from occasional conceptual redundancy and scaffolding. Phrases like "sincerely insincere, a performance of empathy" and the explanation of what the cloak of doubt means metaphorically are paraphrase loops that state the same idea twice. These moments of telling what has just been shown slow the momentum and reduce the prose's overall density and impact.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is atmospheric but suffers from significant repetition and paraphrase loops. The concepts of "withholding," "weaving truth carefully," and the "sycamore hush" are restated multiple times, dulling momentum. Sentences like "She would withhold the full revelation..." and "Elara withheld the key interpretation at first..." state nearly identical information, creating a scaffold-like structure that over-explains the narrative's own method.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting. The high density of figurative language and complex sentences, particularly in the expository first half, slows momentum. Minor but noticeable repetitions of distinctive phrases ("historically reverent," "weathered resolve") suggest a final line-edit is needed to achieve the concision required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is often beautiful but suffers from a high density of figurative language and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "brilliant dimness" and "subdued brilliance," and multiple restatements of the core motivation, create a looping effect that slightly dulls momentum in the story's first half instead of driving it forward with concision.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it is marred by noticeable repetition and text-artifacts. Phrases like "meteor hush," "wandered purposefully," and "hides behind truth" are recycled, creating a looped cadence that feels more like a prose tic than an intentional lyric refrain. This redundancy slightly dulls the momentum and prevents the otherwise strong line-level craft from achieving true excellence, constituting a clear artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in its descriptions. Figurative language, such as "galaxies had folded inward like crumpled parchment," is evocative and effective. The primary flaw is a minor pattern of conceptual looping, where motivational phrases are restated, slightly dampening the otherwise excellent forward momentum of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean, controlled, and often elegant, with a steady rhythm. The piece suffers from a few instances of overwriting and a reliance on familiar genre abstractions ("shadows that whispered," "moths to flame"). The repetition of the phrase "distant intimacy" stands out as a slight tic, and a few moments of summary slightly blunt the immediacy of the otherwise strong scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant repetition and keyword-stuffing, which reads as an artifact of a prompt. Phrases like "lukewarm mage," "earnestly naive," "brittle devotion," and "cosmic imbalance" are recycled multiple times, creating a looped, mechanical feel. While some descriptions are evocative, these redundancies stall momentum and weaken the overall craft.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is clean and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, but there are minor recurring artifacts. Phrases like "mirrored hush" and "precisely humane" are repeated in a way that feels slightly mechanical, echoing prompt elements rather than arising purely from the narrative moment. These repetitions, while thematically consistent, create a faint pattern of scaffold that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and varied syntax. However, the density of figurative language is relentless ("prismatic mists danced like forgotten dreams"), occasionally bordering on overwriting and impeding momentum. While the style is a consistent choice, a more judicious application of metaphor in high-pressure moments would increase the clarity and impact of the climactic action.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong verbs and clear action sequences. However, there is a recurring prose artifact in the repetition of the phrase "soundless echo," which loses impact and becomes a verbal tic rather than a deepening atmospheric element. Some phrasing also tends toward abstraction ("starlit chaos," "ethereal realm"), which slightly distances the reader from the concrete, physical crisis at hand, dulling the immediacy of key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clear and effective, with several strong images ("numbness clung to him like mist"). There are, however, moments that rely on familiar fantasy phrasing ("forged from starlight and shadow," "summoning illusions") which slightly dulls its impact. The final sentence's declaration "defeating the numbness at last" is a minor instance of telling what was already shown by the preceding action.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is clean and often evocative, it is severely weakened by conspicuous text artifacts in the form of high-frequency repetition of non-standard words and phrases ("orthogonal" x4, "storm-born silence" x3, "flow" x5). This conceptual looping reads like a response to a checklist rather than organic prose, significantly dulling momentum and creating a distracting, algorithmic feel that undermines the story's literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.4)
    While the prose is ambitious and often effective, it is weakened by the inclusion of stock metaphors at key descriptive moments. Phrases like "hardened hearts like unyielding stone" and "rain on parched earth" are clichés that momentarily flatten the otherwise unique texture of the narrative. These lapses in originality detract from the overall polish required for this echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative, with a strong command of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the meditative pace effectively. The primary weakness is a tendency toward overwriting; the density of figurative language is consistently high, and some abstract phrases ("interiorizing exteriors," "foggy lucidity") feel more like academic concepts than visceral experiences, slightly distancing the reader from the otherwise strong sensory details.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.8)
    While containing moments of evocative imagery, the prose is burdened by repetitive artifacts and overwriting. The constant reuse of "stoically sensitive" and variations of "creative destruction" creates a noticeable scaffold that dulls momentum and reads like a template.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, there are instances of overwriting where abstract concepts are layered too densely, such as the explanation of the "shard of hush." This occasionally slows momentum and replaces concrete imagery with conceptual explanation, preventing the prose from achieving flawless clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from scaffold-like phrasing and conceptual redundancy. Lines such as "These were no random etchings; they formed via interconnected patterns" and "The method worked via these interconnected patterns" are clunky and expository, telling the reader how to interpret events. Several sentences rely on abstract summary ("merging echoes of other ferries") instead of concrete, propulsive imagery, which dulls the momentum of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from a recurring tic of paired descriptors ("calm, methodical," "thin and resilient," "rationally deceptive") that creates a slightly formulaic cadence. There are also moments of conceptual paraphrase where the narration explains the action's intent immediately after describing it. These minor artifacts prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, the repetition of key thematic phrases ("somber marvel," "balancedly curious") feels like a minor authorial intrusion, a slight scaffolding that could be removed for greater subtlety. While the prose is generally concise, a few moments, like "the action was to expand," are overly declarative and momentarily break the otherwise smooth narrative flow.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often elegant, the prose is hampered by conceptual loops and a tendency to summarize action and theme. The repetition of "reeling hush" is a clear loop that dulls momentum. Furthermore, the final two paragraphs shift from showing to telling, summarizing the heroism and explaining the thematic outcome, which reads like scaffolding that should have been removed in a final draft.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.3)
    The prose is generally strong, with evocative sensory details and a good rhythm. However, there are minor but noticeable artifacts that detract from its polish. The line "the codex margin illuminant gold fleck, as if alive" feels clunky and inserted. A few sentences lean towards telling over showing ("His motivation crystallized"), and there's some slight conceptual redundancy in phrasing ("invisible things—the unremembered"). These small imperfections prevent the prose from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. However, there's a tendency to summarize emotional states ("Alex's motivation burned clear") and rely on telling where showing would be more powerful. The final paragraph, in particular, contains scaffold-like sentences that explain the resolution rather than letting the final image carry the weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often stunning, with powerful, evocative imagery like "the rough bark of ancient trees woven into verbs." However, it is held back by a few key prose artifacts. The phrase "quietly articulate" is repeated three times, functioning as a scaffold that slightly undermines its power. There is also some conceptual redundancy, such as stating the language is dying in the first paragraph and then restating it with different phrasing mid-story, which momentarily slows the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it occasionally slips into overwriting, with multiple metaphors for bitterness and coldness creating redundancy. The sentence structure is varied, but a few key moments rely on conceptual summary rather than propulsive action, such as the line describing loss becoming evolution. This slightly stalls momentum at the climax, where concision would be more powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong verbs and clear momentum. Some phrases, like "burned quietly" or "woven from the rhythms of her own heart," lean on familiar constructions. The line "crumbling not in destruction but in release" is a moment of authorial telling that explains the theme rather than letting the image do the work, a minor but noticeable artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=5.4)
    The prose contains some evocative imagery but is severely hampered by lexical repetition and scaffold-like phrasing. Key terms such as "brittle hush," "respectfully rebellious," "linking absences," and "foster" are looped to the point of distraction, dulling the narrative's momentum. This pattern of verbal artifact suggests a first draft where concepts have not yet been varied or integrated, significantly reducing the polish expected for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and repetition, which dulls its impact and slows momentum. Phrases like "misting hush," "quietly persistent," and "whispering gleam" are recycled multiple times. There are also clear paraphrase loops, such as describing the "misting hush" as a "soft veil of quiet that seemed to mist over everything." While the style is ambitious, its lack of concision and reliance on dense adjectival phrases would require heavy editing for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with a strong rhythmic quality. However, there are moments of slight conceptual redundancy, where an idea is explained at length rather than shown compactly, such as the paragraph defining "analog memories." This momentarily slows the momentum, preventing the prose from achieving perfect concision, though it never compromises clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting. Figurative language is deployed in nearly every sentence, creating a density that ultimately blurs imagery and slows momentum rather than sharpening it. Phrases like "clung to a cliffside like a forgotten thought" or "unfolding in the velvet depths of night" are evocative individually but become overwhelming in aggregate, dulling the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clear and maintains momentum, but it suffers from a high density of abstract descriptors and genre-standard figurative language ("bled into night," "frozen lightning," "pooled like liquid silver"). This overwriting, while atmospheric, dulls the specificity and lands as cliché. Several phrases feel like boilerplate for the genre, preventing the line-level craft from feeling sharp or unique.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum effectively. Sentences are generally well-constructed and serve their purpose without unnecessary clutter. There are, however, minor instances of familiar phrasing ("scattered like leaves in the wind," "swirled like forgotten dreams") and the aforementioned repetition of "crisp." These small artifacts, while not disruptive, prevent the line-level craft from reaching the highest tier of precision and originality.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.3)
    The prose is ambitious but overwritten, relying heavily on invented jargon ("shard-mirror archivist," "combative tenderness") that acts as conceptual scaffolding. There are instances of paraphrase loops, such as when a sentence defining "combative tenderness" immediately follows the introduction of the term. This, combined with some clichéd figurative language, makes the prose feel dense but inefficient.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative. However, it suffers from minor but noticeable repetition artifacts that dull momentum. Phrases like "radiant hush" and the label "insatiably creative" are reused verbatim, creating a slight looping effect rather than developing the concepts. This tic, while not fatal, prevents the line-level craft from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often elegant, the prose is critically flawed by patterned artifacts. There are numerous conceptual loops and near-paraphrases, such as describing how the air "accumulated silence" and then, two sentences later, how the net "accumulated silence." The insistent repetition of the story's key phrases ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush") bogs down the momentum and feels like scaffolding, a major issue for a publication at this level.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong control over rhythm and imagery ("ghostly whispers of color," "mute dance of nature"). There is, however, a minor tendency towards overwriting in a few spots, with slightly redundant phrasing ("precision of a perceptive map framer") and abstract constructions ("vulnerability of these revelations"). While the line-level craft is very high, these occasional lapses in concision hold it back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, concise, and rhythmically controlled, creating momentum while maintaining a somber atmosphere. Word choice is generally strong and specific. The main weakness is a slight tendency toward overwriting in its central metaphor, with phrases like "the math of release" and "the velocity of release" feeling a bit too constructed and self-conscious, slightly disrupting the otherwise seamless craft.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    The prose is mostly clear but suffers from prominent text artifacts. The repetitive phrasing of "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder" creates a template cadence that dulls momentum and reduces information density. While the imagery of the graffiti is strong, these verbal loops are a significant flaw that detracts from the overall line-level craft and elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it suffers from significant conceptual looping. Key phrases—"scattered light," "affectionate detachment," "joy beneath anguish"—are repeated to the point of becoming a scaffold, creating a template-like cadence that dulls momentum. While the repetition is clearly intentional, it functions more as a thematic hammer than a lyric refrain, reducing the information density of the prose in later beats. The final paragraph, in particular, restates several core ideas that have already been established.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and atmospheric, but it is held back by minor but noticeable artifacts. There is some repetition, such as the multiple uses of "dusty starlight," and the phrase "quietly explosive" is used to describe both the climax and the grief, weakening its specific impact. The description of the climax itself, which "shattered Elias's doubts with profound force," relies on a somewhat generic construction that slightly dulls an otherwise powerful moment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding that hold it back from true flawlessness. The core motivation ("to mirror the sky inside walls") is stated almost identically twice, and a few phrases like "Her motivation surged" feel slightly less shown than the rest of the narrative. These are minor but noticeable repetitions in an otherwise stellar piece.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is hampered by a critical weakness at a pivotal moment: "The method came to him in a flash." This summarizes the story's central epiphany rather than dramatizing it, dulling the impact of the discovery. Minor instances of cliché ("heart raced") and repetitive labeling ("diligently curious") also slightly weaken an otherwise strong and atmospheric piece.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with figurative language stacked so densely it occasionally obscures action and dulls momentum ("pierced the frost like spectral flames"). There is a recurring prose artifact around "driftwood," "waveswept bark," and "saline" that feels heavy-handed. This density and repetition of certain metaphorical vehicles prevent the line-level craft from achieving the clarity and propulsion required for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is clean and readable, with some evocative imagery like "brambled hope." However, it suffers from repetition of key phrases from the prompt ("strangely trustworthy," "orchestrate collective effort," "reexamine"), which feel like scaffold rather than organic word choice. The story relies heavily on telling over showing, particularly in emotional moments ("Skepticism bristled," "now intrigued," "Inspired"), summarizing character states instead of dramatizing them through concrete action and perception.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often beautiful and rhythmically controlled, it suffers from a distinct text artifact: the repetitive use of key thematic phrases. "Beautifully flawed" appears three times, and "bruised awe" appears twice, creating a conceptual loop that slightly dulls the impact of these powerful ideas. This repetition, while thematically coherent, reads as a prose tic that an editor would flag for variation, preventing the piece from achieving flawless execution at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is a significant strength, marked by high information density, evocative figurative language, and a controlled, elegant rhythm. Every sentence contributes to atmosphere, character, or plot progression without a trace of scaffolding or redundancy. Figurative language, such as the earth clinging "like a desperate lover," consistently deepens the story's emotional texture rather than feeling merely decorative, demonstrating line-level craft of a publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is ambitious and often lyrical, but it borders on being overwritten, with a high density of figurative language that sometimes slows momentum. There are minor paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same concept (e.g., the chrysalis's symbolism). The relentless intellectual framing occasionally obscures the emotional core with its own cleverness.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains beautiful imagery but is marred by significant conceptual looping. Key phrases ("quantifying absence," "integrated fragmentation," "mindfully scattered") are repeated to the point of becoming prose artifacts, creating a scaffold-like structure that tells the reader the theme instead of letting it emerge. This repetition dulls momentum and gives the piece a slightly mechanical feel despite its poetic aspirations.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels overwrought, especially in moments of high action. Phrases like "tasting the memories like a complex broth needing refinement" and "subsume the stored remorse...to smooth its barbs through his unique alchemy" are abstract and slow the climactic momentum, telling the resolution rather than showing an embodied struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is overwrought, suffering from high figurative density and repetitive phrasing that dulls momentum. Text artifacts like the recurrent label "vigorous tender" and paraphrase loops (where an action is explained and then immediately described) are frequent. For instance, the prose states her method is "interspersing languages" and then immediately shows it, making the initial statement redundant scaffolding. This clutters the narrative and obscures the story's elegant core concept.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but overwritten, with a high density of figurative and conceptual language that sometimes obscures momentum ("reflected light in ways that were chaotically precise, bending reality into unpredictable but exact patterns"). There are text artifacts, including repeated conceptual tags ("profound transformation," "chaotically precise") and scaffolded sentences ("Entangled with it was...", "Linked to it was..."). These loops and the abstract jargon dull the immediacy of the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is functional but hampered by overwriting and repetitive phrasing. Key terms like "latent blaze," "clandestinely," and "serpentine" are overused, dulling their impact. There are several instances of telling over showing, most notably the summary of Elara's climactic thought process. These prose artifacts create a slight drag on momentum and prevent the line-level craft from achieving the precision required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is generally clean and often beautiful, with varied sentence structures creating a pleasing rhythm. The primary flaw is a tendency toward overwriting through conceptual density, where multiple abstract metaphors are layered closely together. There is also minor conceptual redundancy, with the ideas of connection, empathy, and harmony being restated in slightly different phrasing throughout, which slightly dulls the story's forward momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=4.8)
    While often elegant, the prose is severely undermined by pervasive lexical repetition. Key phrases—"correlate," "eclipsed covenant," "thoughtfully precise," "beauty in the difficult"—are used so frequently they become distracting text artifacts, creating a mechanical, template-like cadence that dulls momentum and reduces the story's overall polish for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from significant artifacting that harms momentum. Overwriting is persistent, with dense figurative language in nearly every paragraph ("scent of unshed tears and the texture of frayed velvet"). There is also a clear template cadence in the descriptions of the silences and repetitive label usage ("theatrical sincerity") that function as loops, ultimately weighing down the narrative with excessive ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often evocative and polished, with strong imagery and rhythm ("homes swayed like whispers," "wildflower hush"). However, it occasionally slips into overwriting with stacked abstractions or relies on summary and telling where showing would be more powerful. The final paragraph, in particular, loses momentum by explaining the story's impact rather than letting the established images carry the weight of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative descriptions. However, it suffers from a few minor but noticeable artifacts. The phrase "whirling silence" is repeated four times, becoming a slight crutch, and a key moment of understanding is told rather than shown ("Lira realized this fragment was key..."). These small issues slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose contains some strong imagery, but it is hampered by redundancy and scaffolding. Several sentences paraphrase the content of the preceding one, particularly when establishing motivation ("Her motivation burned... she sought to instill..."). This creates conceptual loops that slow momentum. While the prose is clear, it lacks the concision and high information density of top-tier work, often telling what could be shown through more compressed action.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it is significantly overwrought and suffers from redundancy. Figurative language is stacked so densely that it slows momentum, and paraphrase loops are common (e.g., the "sculpted hush" is described and then re-described). The repetition of specific, unusual phrases creates a template-like cadence that detracts from the line-level propulsion, preventing the prose from achieving true elegance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is evocative and dense, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, there are minor artifacts that prevent a top-tier score. The striking but slightly awkward phrase "avalanchingly quiet" is repeated, and a few other descriptions lean towards being overwrought. While the overall effect is strong, a final polish would remove these subtle redundancies and elevate the craft.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and evocative, with a high density of information and strong, varied rhythms. The word choice is precise and consistently supports the story's unique atmosphere. The score is held back slightly by the sheer density of figurative language in peak moments; phrases like "lucid turbulence" and "clarity and chaos intertwining" risk stating the story's themes abstractly rather than letting the concrete action carry the full weight.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose contains evocative imagery, but it's undercut by two significant issues. First, there's a reliance on abstract, conceptual phrasing ("vibrating sympathetically with the heart's hidden rhythms") that feels repetitive and declarative. Second, the final two paragraphs abandon the scene to summarize years of future events, which functions as a momentum-killing epilogue that tells the long-term outcome rather than trusting the power of the single, resonant scene with Kael.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, with high information density in its descriptions. Sentences like "mist clung to crystalline branches like forgotten secrets" establish the tone immediately. While overwhelmingly strong, a few moments verge on being slightly overwritten with stacked modifiers, a minor artifact that holds it back from the highest tier of purely propulsive and concise line-craft.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=4.8)
    The prose suffers from significant, patterned artifacts that impede momentum and clarity. Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn ("unraveling tapestry," "raveling silence") create redundancy. The story's central emotional beats are dulled by the mechanical repetition of adjective-noun pairings like "stoically sparkling" and "latent sacrifice," which appear four times each, functioning as overwrought labels rather than effective prose.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong control of imagery. However, it is marred by repetitive phrasing and a template cadence, with keywords like "azure defiance," "deliberately," and "bartered awakenings" recurring to the point of becoming prose artifacts that slightly dull momentum. While the individual sentences are often well-crafted, this pattern of repetition prevents the line-level craft from reaching a higher tier.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=5.9)
    The prose contains moments of strong, evocative imagery. Unfortunately, it is weighed down by recurring text artifacts, including scaffolding ("The core concept of her craft was..."), conceptual jargon ("cyclically spontaneous"), and paraphrase loops that restate her motivation. This overwriting clutters the narrative and slows momentum, obscuring the story's stronger line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and atmospheric, but it's held back by some notable repetition and overwriting. The key phrase "luminescent ache" is used three times, diminishing its impact. Some figurative language, while beautiful, feels slightly overwrought or verges on abstraction ("bottle the feeling of safety," "pierced the heart with longing"). These artifacts, while not crippling, prevent the line-level craft from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=6.5)
    While containing moments of beautiful imagery, the prose is burdened by significant scaffolding and redundancy. Multiple paraphrase-loops exist where adjacent sentences restate Elowen's motivation with different words, which drains momentum. The density of figurative language is high, but its cumulative effect feels more overwritten than precise, particularly with the repetition of key phrases like "shadowed elation."

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.9)
    The line-level craft is strong, with many striking images like "jasmine tea that tasted of distant storms." The prose is clean and propulsive. However, there's a tendency toward overwriting, with some sentences becoming dense with figurative language ("her voice a quiet explosion of insight that rippled through the air"). The repeated use of the exact phrases "quietly explosive" and "iridescent caution" creates a slight scaffold-like feel, a prose artifact that slightly mars an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery like "moonlight pooled on the floor like spilled mercury." However, in the section describing the mapping, the language becomes overly conceptual and abstract ("deconstructed the sorrow, breaking it down into its core elements"). This creates a slight drag on momentum, replacing sensory experience with intellectual summary. While the overall craft is high, these moments of abstraction slightly dull the story's otherwise sharp immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is ambitious and often beautiful, it suffers from a lack of concision and a tendency towards overwriting. Several passages contain paraphrase loops or stacked metaphors that blunt momentum, such as "The swaddling was no mere binding; it was a gentle embrace." The density of figurative language, while atmospheric, sometimes obscures rather than sharpens the action, indicating a need for a rigorous line edit to achieve publishable clarity and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and grammatically sound, but it suffers from a tendency toward abstraction and low information density in key moments. There are several instances of paraphrase loops, such as describing "enlarged tranquility" and then immediately restating it as "a vast calm that expanded." This conceptual redundancy, combined with a reliance on telling over showing emotional states, keeps the line-level craft from feeling truly sharp or propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=6.5)
    While often evocative, the prose is significantly weakened by prominent text artifacts. Key phrases—"creeping normality," "heuristically gentle," "uncloak," "tenuous absolution"—are looped multiple times, creating a didactic rhythm that hammers the theme. This conceptual redundancy dulls the momentum and gives the piece a templated feel, obscuring the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often elegant but is significantly weakened by conspicuous repetition. Key phrases like "gently meticulous," "quartz hush," and "conjure meaning" are reused to the point of becoming prose artifacts that feel like scaffolding. This looping undercuts the story's organic feel and creates a mechanical cadence, dulling the momentum despite the otherwise strong imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant and propulsive, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there are minor repetitive artifacts that a final polish would remove, such as the verbatim repetition of "curiously steadfast" and "truce of hush." These slight echoes, while not damaging, prevent the prose from reaching flawless execution by creating a noticeable pattern where variation would be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from a recurring prose artifact: the phrase "terrestrially cosmic" is used three times, diminishing its impact and making it feel like a tic rather than a thoughtful descriptor. While individual sentences are well-crafted, this repetition, along with other heavily curated phrases, creates a slight sense of overwriting that impedes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose contains striking imagery ("veins of quartz pulsed with an inner light like trapped auroras"), but is hampered by occasional overwriting and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "suppressed his creativity, bottling it up" and "uncork that suppressed creativity...set his creativity free" are minor paraphrase loops. The description of the mechanical contraption is a dense, summary-like sentence that stalls momentum at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong imagery. There are minor instances of stock phrasing ("Tears welled") and a tendency toward dense figurative language that occasionally feels slightly overwritten. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished and professional execution at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Its primary weakness is a tendency toward overwriting, where the density of abstract figurative language ("iridescent hue," "melodic revelations") occasionally blurs meaning rather than sharpening it. A minor template cadence appears during the description of the sculpture's construction, but overall the line-level craft is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but occasionally its density works against it. A few adjacent sentences restate similar ideas ("memories clashing... unresolved fears... amplifying... chaos"), creating minor drag. Figurative language is strong but pervasive, sometimes verging on overwriting in moments of high action, which can slightly blunt the momentum of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains a pleasing rhythm. While generally strong, it is marked by occasional abstract emotional summaries ("unfolding layers of pain and resilience") where concrete action would be more powerful. There are also minor repetitive sentence structures used to introduce backstory, which slightly dull the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with dense figurative language in nearly every sentence that can slow momentum. There are several paraphrase loops where the same idea (e.g., her motivation) is restated with different elaborate phrasing. The sentence-level craft is generally clean, but the sheer density of metaphor and lyrical description borders on purple prose, sometimes obscuring the action rather than clarifying it.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and frequently evocative, marked by striking imagery like crystals blooming as "frozen fireworks." There is a minor but persistent tendency toward overwriting, with phrases like "silent symphony of gleams" feeling slightly self-conscious. While there are no major structural artifacts, a few near-redundancies (e.g., "silent gleam" followed by "without sound") slightly dull the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often beautiful, but it is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting and repetition. There are several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles around concepts of silence and prophecy. Most notably, the phrase "terrestrially cosmic" is used three times, diminishing its impact and reading as a textual artifact. These issues prevent the otherwise strong prose from achieving the propulsion and clarity required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative. However, the repeated use of the provided phrases "patiently nimble" (three times) and "mysterious familiarity" (three times) creates a noticeable template cadence that feels slightly mechanical. While these are required elements, their integration could be less repetitive. This recurrence slightly dulls the propulsion in places, preventing a higher score for an otherwise strong prose performance.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=5.5)
    While often evocative, the prose is hampered by significant text artifacts that dull momentum and clarity. There are numerous paraphrase loops and repetitive keyword usage (e.g., "quarantined," "isolation," "independence") that read like scaffold. The consistent high density of figurative language borders on overwriting, and the reliance on abstract nouns to convey emotion weakens the story's immediacy, particularly around the otherwise strong closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from a high density of figurative language that occasionally feels overwrought, and there are minor instances of conceptual looping, such as restating the idea of "wisely enduring" with "a quiet fortitude." These small artifacts slightly weigh down an otherwise polished and professional line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and rhythmic, but marred by minor recurring artifacts. The phrase "reed-blown melancholy" is reused, and there's a reliance on genre descriptors like "webs of intrigue" and "tangled motives" that feel slightly generic. While generally strong, this tendency toward ornate phrasing over sharp, specific imagery keeps it from the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is predominantly elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. However, a few minor artifacts prevent a top-tier score. There is a slight paraphrase loop in the repetition of the "weave it carefully" concept, and a few phrases lean into abstraction where concrete detail would be stronger. These are minor issues that do not touch the clean execution of the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, there is a recurring tendency toward overwriting with stacked, self-conscious descriptors like "scintillatingly somber glow" and "demure audacity." Some sentences also exhibit minor paraphrase loops (e.g., "hidden patterns, invisible threads") that slightly dilute the prose's momentum. While beautiful, the writing would benefit from a final edit for concision and to remove a few overly ornate phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is clean, dense, and propulsive, with a strong rhythm and varied sentence structure. Information is delivered with precision, avoiding overwriting and scaffolding. While a phrase like "His heart raced" is a minor cliché, the overall quality of the line-level craft is exceptionally high, demonstrating a disciplined and effective style that serves the story's momentum perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can feel strenuous. Sentences like "The structure, a relic of some bygone era, featured a cobalt glass portico that gleamed like a sapphire wound under lightning's erratic strobe" are evocative but contribute to a texture that is uniformly rich, risking reader fatigue. The piece would be stronger with more concision and moments of plainer language to provide contrast and heighten the impact of its key images.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=4.3)
    The prose is consistently overwritten, with sentences laden with stacked adjectives and figurative language that slow momentum ("tapestry of lonesome splendor, beautiful in its isolation"). This density gives the prose an artificial, strained quality. The repetition of "positively wistful" is a notable prose artifact, and the overall lack of concision would necessitate a significant line edit for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=5.2)
    The prose is ambitious but significantly overwrought, which impedes momentum. There is a pervasive text artifact of using paired, abstract descriptors ("calculated fear and raw emotion," "fleshly pull ... ethereal call," "fleshly tremor ... ethereal song"), which becomes a repetitive template. This syntactic loop, combined with a high density of figurative language in peak moments, clutters the narrative and obscures the action. The piece suffers from a lack of concision and an over-reliance on telling the emotional/tonal state through these recurring word pairs.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean and rhythmic but is hampered by conceptual redundancy. Several sentences restate the same idea with different phrasing (e.g., "sculpt patience from impatience, forging a steady resolve from their chaotic urges"). This pattern of paraphrase-looping, while grammatically correct, slows momentum and pads the prose, reducing the information density required for top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a reliance on abstract jargon ("empirical observation," "controlling influence") that is repeated like a mantra, creating a mechanical rhythm. Several sentences contain paraphrase loops that state an idea and then immediately restate it with different words, which slightly dulls momentum. For example, "a fortified vulnerability mirroring her own state—strong walls built around a fragile core."

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=4.2)
    The prose is undermined by noticeable textual artifacts that disrupt its flow and clarity. There is significant repetition of key phrases, such as "vibrant hush" (used three times) and the "aptly deliberate" loop. This, combined with a tendency toward overwriting, creates a prose style that is more labored than elegant, drawing attention to its own construction rather than immersing the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose is often vivid and inventive, it suffers from significant issues of overwriting and repetition that would require editorial intervention. The word "evolving" appears four times, and the phrase "steadily curious" is used twice, creating noticeable prose artifacts that dull momentum. The relentless density of figurative language in nearly every sentence, while ambitious, ultimately weighs the narrative down and feels excessive.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum effectively. However, it occasionally relies on familiar phrasing ("lingered like ghosts," "burning brighter") and conceptual redundancy (multiple descriptions of the "absence" and "void"). While there are no major line-level artifacts, a final polish to sharpen word choice and eliminate these minor repetitions would increase its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, but it suffers from distinct paraphrase-looping. The repetition of key phrases—"map empathy onto action," "calmly intuitive"—functions as a scaffolding that dulls momentum. While the sentence-level craft is otherwise strong, these conceptual redundancies are a noticeable artifact that weighs down an otherwise propulsive narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with a strong, varied rhythm. The figurative language is mostly purposeful and evocative, contributing to the story's powerful atmosphere. There are minor instances where abstraction slightly dulls the momentum ("trawl the depths of existence...drag up truths"), preventing a perfect score, but the line-level craft remains very high overall, with no significant technical flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from overwriting and a reliance on abstract summary in key moments. Phrases like "nurturing a bridge of understanding that transcended their solitary paths" and "intersubjective understanding budding between them" tell the reader the emotional outcome instead of letting the scene's particulars create it. This tendency to use abstract or academic language ("intersubjective") dulls the immediacy of the connection being forged.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is stylistically ambitious, it suffers from overwriting and redundancy. Figurative language is so dense it sometimes obscures rather than clarifies, and paraphrase loops occur, such as the repeated phrasing of the core motivation. The sentence structure has a tendency towards a similar, stately cadence, slightly dulling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is often graceful but is marred by repetitive sentence structures and prose artifacts. The phrase "as vines climbed" is used as a mechanical, template-cadence transition. There's also a high density of adjectives and adverbs that label emotion rather than embodying it ("perceptively calm," "whimsical earnestness"), which dulls the immediacy of key moments and feels like authorial scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and ambitious but hampered by moments of overwriting and redundancy. A key sentence contains a paraphrase loop: "a suspended hush enveloped the room—a profound silence hanging in the air." Throughout the piece, the high density of figurative language and complex syntax occasionally thickens the prose to the point of slowing momentum, a notable flaw in an otherwise polished work.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from moments of overwriting and density, particularly in the opening paragraphs. Phrases like "mist-shrouded expanse" and "quiet ache of time's passage" verge on purple prose. While the rhythm is controlled, a more varied sentence structure and greater concision would give the powerful images more room to breathe and increase momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often elegant, but suffers from overwriting in key moments. Figurative language is sometimes too dense, and conceptual labels like "Escape velocity achieved—not in flight, but in transcendence" replace embodied experience with abstraction. This tendency to summarize a feeling or concept, rather than letting the image do the work, slightly dulls the story's otherwise sharp mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is polished but suffers from significant repetitive phrasing that acts as a scaffold. Key phrases—"decisively kind," "pulsing stillness," "flawless goodbye," "scent of hope"—are recycled multiple times, creating a template-cadence feel that dulls their impact. This looping of thematic labels reads as an artifact of the story's construction, reducing momentum and lending the piece a somewhat mechanical rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is clear but exhibits some repetitive patterns and scaffolding. The phrase "quietly deliberate" is used as a label twice, and the core action "closing loops" is mentioned five times, creating a slightly mechanical rhythm. Some constructions feel redundant, summarizing information just provided (e.g., "It wasn't just a key; it was the heart..."). These minor artifacts slightly reduce momentum and information density, preventing the prose from achieving a truly polished, propulsive quality.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is generally clear but is marred by repetitive phrasing and scaffold sentences built around key prompt words ("forgiven," "innovation," "constellations"). Some sentences are overwritten and abstract, such as describing memories as "innovated...into blueprints for healing." These prose artifacts create a looped, mechanical rhythm that dulls momentum and reduces the story's emotional immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is hampered by noticeable scaffolding. The phrase "as memories resurfaced" is repeated four times, functioning as a mechanical trigger that feels more like a template than an organic element of the prose. This repetitive structural device, along with some dense phrasing like "reflectively vibrant—mirroring the grotto's misty hues in vivid blues and greens," slightly dulls the momentum and polish of an otherwise strong piece.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. There is, however, a recurring tendency towards overwriting, with phrases like "forgotten algorithms reborn as art" and "honeyed hush" feeling slightly ornate or pre-packaged. The repetition of the phrase "quietly proactive" is a minor scaffold that could be removed for greater subtlety and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often lyrical and ambitious, it is significantly hampered by text artifacts. The repeated use of specific words ("solemn") and phrases ("swirling hush") creates distracting loops. More critically, the three hope-harvesting sequences follow an identical template cadence, which undermines narrative momentum and makes the prose feel mechanical and predictable, especially in a piece this short.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose is often lyrical, it suffers from a tendency toward overwriting and abstraction. The density of similes ("like lovers' fingers," "like a question mark," "like sleepy children") can feel ornate rather than precise. More critically, key magical concepts rely on abstract phrases like "shimmered with hidden power" and "channeling cosmic aid," which tell the reader about the magic instead of grounding it in concrete sensory detail, slightly dulling the immediacy of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates a strong command of language. However, its unyielding density of figurative language—while often beautiful—occasionally borders on being overwritten. In some passages, the sheer accumulation of metaphors and poetic descriptions creates a static, ornamental quality that slightly impedes the narrative's otherwise deliberate momentum, particularly when describing states of being rather than actions.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often beautiful and evocative, it suffers from a tendency toward conceptual redundancy. The central metaphor of storing wonder is rephrased multiple times ("store wonder in the cellar of reason," "preserve fragments of awe," "tucking them away in logical constructs," "vials of logic"), creating paraphrase loops that slightly dampen momentum. This high density of abstract figurative language, while thematically coherent, sometimes feels overwrought and less propelled by concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but its momentum is weakened by distinct paraphrase loops. The line "But her trap tightened..." is followed paragraphs later by the nearly identical "But her own trap persisted..." This redundancy feels like authorial scaffolding and interrupts the otherwise immersive flow, constituting a noticeable prose artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and dense with information. Sentence structure is varied, and the rhythm supports the melancholic tone. There are no significant technical flaws. The piece walks a fine line with its highly figurative language, which is consistently beautiful but occasionally risks feeling overwritten or leaning on a familiar image, such as "steam curling up like memories surfacing." This minor slip prevents a score in the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and dense with imagery, demonstrating strong craft. Minor slips like the clichéd "Regret bloomed in her chest" and the slightly over-insistent repetition of "erode" prevent a higher score. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent, carrying momentum through a reflective narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is clear but marred by significant repetition of key phrases ("maze of intentions," "puzzled out new equations for hope," "stoic wonder"). This looping creates a scaffold-like quality that feels artificial and slows momentum. While individual sentences are competent, the over-reliance on these thematic tags reads like a checklist, dulling the impact of an otherwise strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=6.8)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from significant repetition artifacts. The phrases "glacial hush" and "excruciatingly gentle" are used three times each, functioning as a repetitive scaffold that lessens their impact. This loop-like quality, particularly in key moments, dulls the otherwise strong imagery and creates a sense of overwriting that slows the story's momentum at a line level.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is often elegant, but it is severely undermined by pervasive text artifacts. There are numerous paraphrase loops ("He'd trained his instincts... It was by training instincts...") and a recurring template cadence built around the required elements. This repetition ("thoughtfully clear," "serene upheaval") feels inorganic and breaks the immersive quality, reading more like a checklist being filled than fluid prose.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and highly evocative, with strong sensory details. However, there are minor instances of near-redundancy that slightly dilute its power, such as pairing "embodied that attribute" with "taught him the art of endless forbearance." A few phrases, like "tempered his excitement," lean on cliché. While the overall effect is impressive, a stricter line edit would sharpen its impact and remove these small drags on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is generally strong, with evocative and precise language. However, the prose is relentlessly dense with figurative language, which at times feels overwrought and blunts momentum ("autumn leaves drifted like forgotten promises," "branches arching like the ribs of some ancient, forsaken cathedral"). This density, while contributing to atmosphere, occasionally slips into purple prose and creates a slight barrier to the character's core emotional experience.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose suffers from significant, momentum-killing artifacts. Pervasive repetition of keywords ("hypothesized," "quaking," "reverie," "flawed genesis") creates distracting loops and a template-like cadence that reads as authorial scaffolding. While some imagery is strong, the line-level craft is fundamentally undermined by this lack of variation and concision, obscuring the story's conceptual strengths beneath a layer of mechanical prose.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.6)
    While grammatically clean, the prose suffers from two significant artifacts: overwriting and patterned repetition. The figurative language is dense to the point of being strenuous, and the recurring use of identical phrases ("gracefully alert," "unyielding compassion," "kelp-drift peace") creates a looping, artificial cadence. These repetitions dull momentum and read like rubric items being checked off rather than organic description.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.5)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from significant overwriting and repetitive phrasing. Elevated descriptors ("sidereal patience," "cosmic signal") and recurring motifs ("defiant hush") are used too heavily, creating a sense of artificiality. There are instances of scaffold-like phrasing ("The timeframe began from...") and redundancy, where concepts are stated and then restated. While often beautiful, the density of figurative language sometimes slows momentum and obscures the clean action.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and ambitious, with high information density in its figurative language. However, a subtle but noticeable template cadence appears in several descriptive phrases (e.g., "her form a shimmering veil," "its teeth etched with algorithms," "each signal a gentle probe"). This minor repetitive structure slightly flattens the rhythm in places, holding the line-level craft back from true excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, it is weakened by a few noticeable prose artifacts that a top publication would require revising. The repetition of key phrases ("thundering calm," "fiercely meditative") and a dense cluster of storm-related metaphors ("faint thunder," "low rumble," "distant storm clouds," "steady thunder") creates a loop that slightly dulls the impact of the otherwise strong language.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is often vivid and evocative, but it suffers from conceptual redundancy and scaffolding. Key phrases like "restore shared balance" and "ethically diligent" are repeated, creating loops that stall momentum. This repetition of abstract concepts acts as a crutch, telling the reader what to think instead of trusting the images and actions to convey the meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is stylistically dense but suffers from overwriting and repetition that dulls momentum. Words like "velveteen," "cobalt," "blithe," and "tenderly organized" are reused, creating noticeable loops. The primary issue is the high density of figurative language in nearly every sentence, which feels labored rather than effortless, obscuring the story's elegant emotional core under layers of adornment.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong rhythm and sentence variety. However, the piece is slightly marred by a recurring use of abstract conceptual labels in place of embodied experience, such as "groundedly imaginative" and "the tone of sustaining transformation." This tendency towards jargon-like phrasing, particularly near the climax, creates a minor drag on momentum and represents a missed opportunity for greater immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose suffers from noticeable text artifacts, particularly paraphrase loops and synonym churn. Phrases like "shortwave radio dial glow" or concepts like "secretly luminous" are introduced and then restated with slight variations, which dulls momentum and clutters the otherwise evocative language.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and imagery. However, there is a minor paraphrase loop where the narration explains his method twice in quick succession ("weaving truth carefully," then "Through incomplete information"). This, combined with the tendency to use conceptual labels ("mirage of safety," "crystallize an emotion"), slightly dulls the otherwise sharp line-level execution by telling what has already been shown.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. However, minor prose artifacts prevent a higher score. There are a few instances of near-redundancy and looped phrasing, such as repeating "competing narratives" and the slightly tautological "his rationally rebellious mind rebelling." These small loops slightly dull momentum but do not harm the clarity of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. However, the story is marred by a significant prose artifact: the cyclical repetition of specific thematic phrases. This repetition functions as a form of scaffolding or a paraphrase loop across paragraphs, which measurably dulls momentum and makes the narrative feel programmatic. While the language is polished, this structural tic prevents the prose from reaching the highest tier of craftsmanship.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong imagery ("iron skeletons," "breath of neglect"). However, it occasionally slips into redundancy, restating core ideas like "transforming decay" in slightly different terms. The block of text explaining synaptic plasticity functions as an info-dump that temporarily stalls the narrative momentum, reading more like world-building notes than lived-in prose.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is rich and evocative, but it occasionally tips into overwriting, with figurative language ("sky dripped honeyed light," "gleaming like solidified honey") layered so densely it can slow momentum. There are also moments of summary that replace scene, such as the final paragraphs restating Thorne's intent and the story's theme. While the line-level craft is generally clean, it lacks the concision and propulsion of top-tier work.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it relies on repeating key phrases—"creeping normality," "hushed blaze," "shard of hush"—to the point where they feel more like authorial labels than organic thoughts. This prose artifact, coupled with minor paraphrase loops (e.g., explaining "hushed blaze" multiple ways in one sentence), slightly dulls the otherwise sharp line-level craft and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is mostly clear and competent, with some evocative imagery. However, it suffers from several prose artifacts, notably paraphrase loops. Phrases like "incisively kind, cutting through her shock with compassionate precision" and "her kindness incisive, slicing away illusions without cruelty" restate the same concept in adjacent sentences, slowing momentum and betraying a lack of concision.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, with strong sentence-level propulsion during the climactic proof. Momentum is well-maintained, and information density is high. The score is constrained by text artifacts; the triple repetition of the adverbial phrase "balancedly daring" functions as a loop that feels inorganic and momentarily breaks the narrative spell, preventing entry into the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmically controlled, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally slips into redundancy. For instance, "Elias was methodically hopeful, believing that... small acts could echo eternally" is immediately followed by "His motivation burned quietly: to prove that strangers remember kindness," a paraphrase loop that restates the same core idea. These moments of telling-as-scaffolding slightly blunt the momentum of an otherwise sharp and poetic piece.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, but slightly marred by a few weaknesses. The "rosewater" simile, while initially effective, is repeated three times, becoming a bit of a thematic hammer. Some phrases, like "began to work its magic," dip into cliché, momentarily breaking the otherwise strong and specific prose.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose contains vivid imagery but is hampered by significant text artifacts. Key phrases are repeated ("bleak exhilaration" 3x, "neatly inventive" 2x, "latent radiance" 4x), creating noticeable loops that reduce momentum. While the syntax is varied, an over-density of adjectives sometimes clutters the lines, a form of overwriting that slightly dulls the story's propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.5)
    While the prose contains strong, memorable images ("rotting fabrics dangling like flayed skin"), it is frequently hampered by overwriting and a reliance on familiar phrasing ("burning like a fever," "lingered like a bad dream"). The repetition of the key phrase "repulsive allure" is a notable slip. This density of modifiers and stock descriptions weighs down the narrative momentum and prevents the line-level craft from reaching the highest echelon of literary quality.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it suffers from minor but noticeable conceptual repetition that acts as a prose artifact. The words "euphony" (four times) and "fractal" (used five times, plus variants) are overused, becoming labels rather than letting the imagery do the work. This slight overwriting in peak beats dulls the otherwise sharp execution, particularly in the climax where the language could be more varied.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates strong momentum. However, minor repetition of key phrases ("sunwashed dread," "quietly driven") becomes noticeable in a piece of this length, functioning as a small scaffold. While the language is evocative, these slight loops prevent the piece from achieving the flawless density required for the highest scores.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    The prose is clean and often evocative, but it's held back by minor but noticeable artifacts. There are several instances of paraphrase loops where adjacent sentences restate the same idea (e.g., the initial description of his motivation). This redundancy, while not severe, slightly dulls the story's momentum and information density in key introductory and character-defining moments.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.1)
    The prose contains many moments of vivid, powerful imagery, such as the ink flowing like "shadowed blood." Unfortunately, its overall quality is significantly undermined by conspicuous prose artifacts. The repeated use of identical key phrases ("interlaced absence," "hushed blaze," "stoically sensitive") creates a loop that feels mechanical and overwrought, reducing momentum and cheapening the story's emotional core by turning poignant concepts into mere buzzwords.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=4.5)
    The prose is clean but suffers critically from scaffold and loop artifacts. The forced repetition of key terms from the prompt ("readjusted," "dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness") creates a mechanical, template-like cadence that hinders momentum and breaks immersion. This overwriting makes the narrative feel constructed around a checklist rather than flowing organically from character and situation.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious but significantly overwrought, harming momentum. There is a frequent repetition of key words ("luminous" appears five times, "torment" five times), which dulls their impact and reads as a prose artifact. The density of figurative language, while often beautiful, occasionally becomes a thicket that slows the narrative rather than propelling it forward, warranting a penalty for overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lyrical and precise for the most part, but it is marred by a few conspicuous repetitions that function as prose artifacts. The phrase "intangibly tangible" is used three times, and "bleak exhilaration" twice; this recurrence reads as a slight lack of verbal invention rather than a purposeful motif, momentarily thinning the otherwise rich texture. While the overall quality is very high, these loops prevent it from reaching the highest echelon of flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from significant text-artifact issues in the form of repetitive phrasing. The phrase "perpetual surprise" appears five times, "brilliant dimness" four times, and "sharp eyes" four times. This looping of descriptors dulls momentum and reduces information density, reading like an over-adherence to prompt elements rather than organic prose. While the sentences are grammatically sound, these loops are a notable flaw that undermines the otherwise evocative language.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=6.9)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, with strong imagery. However, it suffers from overwriting and repetition that dulls its impact. Key phrases like "tempered regret," "quell," and "sieved hush" are recycled, creating a scaffold-like effect. The line "The sieved hush was his core concept" is a jarring intrusion of meta-commentary that severely disrupts momentum and clarity, representing a significant text artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details that bring the misty parapet to life. However, it is held back by minor but noticeable instances of redundancy and overwriting. Phrases like "storm-worn windblown" feel slightly over-stacked, and the restatement of the "recycle mistakes into wisdom" concept creates a small conceptual loop. The final paragraph's move toward summarizing the theme is a prose artifact that slightly flattens the momentum of an otherwise sharp and well-crafted narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often lands strong, vivid images. However, it suffers from prose artifacts, primarily the repetitive use of keywords ("backlash of regrets," "flickering faith," "gravitating"). This creates paraphrase loops across paragraphs that feel more like fulfilling a checklist than organic storytelling, slightly dulling the momentum and giving the piece a somewhat artificial texture that a top-tier publication would flag for revision.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is generally strong and evocative, but it occasionally leans on overwriting and summarizing language that dulls momentum. The final paragraph, in particular, uses scaffolding ("born from this journey," "a path to redemption") that replaces the immediacy of the moment with a less impactful summary of its meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it frequently tips into overwriting. The high density of figurative language ("cradle of stars," "eyes like nebulae," "lovers' breaths against her skin") in nearly every paragraph can overwhelm the narrative and dull its own impact. The reliance on abstract, declarative emotional states over concrete embodiment makes key moments feel summarized rather than lived.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=5.5)
    While often elegant, the prose suffers from significant overwriting. Nearly every sentence is laden with a metaphor or simile ("stars pierced...like forgotten promises," "moments pooled like forgotten rain," "crack...whispered of innocence shattered"). This excessive density of figurative language, a clear pattern artifact, muddles the story's emotional core and dulls the impact of its strongest images, requiring a firm editorial hand to pare it back for clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is clean but suffers from a template cadence in the central loop of action ("As she delved... she mended... As understanding bloomed... she grew..."). This rhythmic repetition slightly dulls momentum. Some phrasing feels abstract ("faded dreams," "ghostly resolve"), which, while tonally appropriate, could be sharpened with more concrete sensory detail to avoid generalization.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.2)
    The prose is ambitious but frequently overwritten, with dense figurative language that occasionally slows momentum ("slow dance of celestial bodies, planets aligning in a languid waltz"). There is some conceptual repetition, particularly with the words "hush," "vibrant," and the phrase "texture of transformation." While grammatically sound, the line-level craft could achieve greater impact through more concision and less reliance on elevated, multi-clause sentences to convey atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=5.5)
    While the prose is often evocative, it is significantly weakened by pervasive repetition of key phrases from the prompt. Terms like "winking hush" (used four times), "cradle of sparks," and "calmly inventive" are overused, creating a text-artifact issue that reads like a checklist. This synonym churn dulls the momentum and gives the piece an artificial texture, which is its most significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, but it occasionally slips into abstraction and overwriting, particularly during the climax ("sacred geometries..."). Some key phrases are repeated as motifs, which is effective but also creates a slightly predictable cadence. While many sentences are sharp and evocative, the overall effect is slightly hampered by a lack of concision in pivotal moments.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=5.8)
    The prose suffers from significant overwriting and redundancy, which bogs down the narrative momentum. There is a high density of figurative language and stacked adjectives ("stormlit," "churning," "flickering," "forbidden," "storm-kissed," "turbulent") that dulls the impact of individual images. Paraphrase loops appear, such as "mapping the wounds... tracing their jagged lines," which restate the same idea and violate the principle of concision required for top-tier publication.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it is marred by distinct text artifacts that would require editorial cleanup. The verbatim repetition of the clunky phrase "via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial" is a notable flaw, and there are minor instances of conceptual redundancy where ideas like "dignified chaos" are stated and then immediately paraphrased.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with strong verbs and a clear rhythm. However, it frequently tips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can feel self-conscious ("twisted like forgotten promises," "glinting off its lid like a fractured halo"). The repetition of "fracture" in various forms is the most significant artifact, a loop that diminishes the power of a key image. While generally clear, this lack of restraint prevents the prose from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong rhythmic control. However, there are minor instances of overwriting, particularly with stacked abstract adjectives ("steely longing, a resolute ache...sharp as resolve yet soft with yearning"). A few adjacent sentences also paraphrase the same idea, creating small pockets of redundancy that slightly dampen the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and clear, but there is a recurring pattern of paraphrase-loops, where a concept is introduced and then immediately restated in different terms (e.g., "cultural memory... the shared recollections"). This scaffolding, while clarifying, slightly slows the momentum. Removing these near-redundancies would elevate the prose from very good to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, but it suffers from occasional overwriting and redundancy. Sentences like "isolation amplified his cerulean regret, a blue-tinged sorrow that colored his days" contain a paraphrase loop where "cerulean regret" and "blue-tinged sorrow" are near-synonyms. This density can slow momentum and slightly dull the impact of an otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose features high density with metaphors advancing atmosphere, like clouds boiling as an unquiet sea, but paraphrase loops appear in repetitive storm descriptions (e.g., lightning dancing, illuminating, flashing) that dull momentum without payoff; syntactic variety is present, yet figurative overload in peak beats like the map's revelation muddles clarity slightly, though propulsion holds through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose advances atmosphere through dense, purposeful images like whirring gears and fragmented light, with varied rhythm avoiding monotony. Overwriting in peak beats, such as repetitive "dignified chaos" loops and mixed metaphors (storm of thoughts, babbling brook indifference), triggers minor deductions for density issues without obscuring closure. Sentence propulsion accelerates in the duel, but paraphrase loops like repeated waiting tension dull momentum slightly. The final line resolves with resonant image, recharging motifs cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose has high density with purposeful rhythm in poetic lines like "shedding personalities like snake skin," advancing atmosphere; however, paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated "fracture" and "bloom" without fresh pressure) and mixed metaphors (e.g., "fractured halo") dull momentum in peak beats, triggering -0.6 artifact penalty. Clarity remains, but overwriting in reflective blocks obscures propulsion. Final line resolves strongly by recharging motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "vine-woven platforms bobbed on invisible waves," but occasional paraphrase loops, such as repeating "longing" variants, slightly dull momentum in reflective beats. Rhythm varies naturally, with syntactic variety accelerating in action like threading the reel; no major artifacts obscure closure, though some figurative muddle in "notes sharp as resolve yet soft with yearning" clashes mildly. Clarity holds, with strong verbs and specific details propelling to the triumphant end.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "petals shimmered under a doubtful sun," but repetitive stems like "doubt luminous" and synonym loops (e.g., "luminous pollen, ethereal haze, soft glow") create minor template cadence in peak beats without full payoff. Rhythm varies naturally, with strong verbs and specific nouns, though figurative stacking in the dream library borders on muddle without harming clarity. No major artifacts obscure closure, but paraphrase loops in doubt descriptions dull momentum slightly; opening anchors voice effectively, final line recharges motifs with propulsion. Grammar and punctuation are clean, with purposeful fragments enhancing trance feel.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with vivid images like "blue-tinged sorrow," varying rhythm purposefully, but occasional paraphrase loops (e.g., repeated tides of remembrance) and mixed metaphors in peak reflection dull momentum slightly without obscuring closure.

    Prose avoids loops, each sentence carries dual purpose (image + escalation). Metaphors stay coherent: “palette spread like ink in water” is the only figurative bloom and it lands clean. Momentum is high; pauses are purposeful. No artifact artifacts; ellipsis and enjambment serve crescendo. Final image (“muffled dawn of revelation”) provides satisfying cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense yet fluid, sentences shaped like the nautilus—long coils leading to the punctum. Occasional overwriting (“silence that lifted like breath before melody”) is on-brand and propels rather than pads.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and propulsive; figurative language is patterned and paid off (“between the drop and the ripple” frames and closes). Minor loop risk in “brightness darkened” variants, but rhythm remains varied. No mixed metaphors or scaffold clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; sentences multitask (e.g., “dust-moted light, lay a shard… frozen tears”). No loops or scaffold. Metaphors are coherent, though “burnished sorrow” recurs enough to risk minor repetition. Final cadence slows to crystallize closure without slack.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    Texture alternates between mineral crunch and ballerina glide; sentence rhythm echoes the expanding and contracting echo chamber. A few ornate flourishes during the “wilting ferns” list slow mid-pulse but do not obscure clarity at closure.

    Prose is clean, propulsive, and free of loops. One paraphrase loop (“radiation meters on his suit dipping to safe levels—an impossible oasis”) could be trimmed. Otherwise, high density and no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is dense and musical, with purposeful repetition (“shadows,” “dawn,” “whimsy”) that accumulates texture rather than loops. A few stacked metaphors (“sapphire wound,” “lightning shards”) flirt with overwriting but serve the lyric mode; no clarity is lost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose propels: sentences advance action or atmosphere without loops. Metaphors are mostly controlled; “liquid flesh infused with starlight” strains slightly. High information density; only one near-duplicate phrase “fleeting golden sunset” recurs.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.8)

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is clean, rhythmic, and information-dense; figurative language is selective. One near-loop (“vibrant hush” twice in close proximity) and a faintly ornate phrase (“melodies frozen in time”) keep it from the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; every sentence does double duty—worldbuilding and interiority. Metaphors are precise: “gears grinding like cosmic laughter” marries sound and scale. One scaffold loop: “evolving” is overused across three adjacent sentences, dulling the final third. Otherwise, rhythm breathes with scene needs, and no mixed metaphors intrude on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.3)
    Syntax pulses with purposeful lists and compressions—“echoes in the data like a breadcrumb trail”—and avoids loops. One near-redundant “archive/archive” could be excised without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.7)

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is lean and musical, free of loops; a single "excruciatingly gentle" refrain earns its repetition by charging the final image with felt cost. No density flaws in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rhythmic variation from slow-motion twilight to clipped dawn lines keeps momentum without scaffold. Information density high: “mirroring his introspective mood as fireflies danced like errant thoughts” carries mood and stakes simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, each sentence advancing image or beat. Minor loop—“perpetual surprise” thrice—dulls edge; one mixed metaphor (“secrets half-revealed” vs. “fading light danced”) nicks clarity. Otherwise clean, vivid, and read-aloud ready.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is clean, patient, yet vivid—“driftwood littered the sand like remnants of shattered lives” conveys cost without overwriting. Rhythm accelerates downhill, breathes at discovery, tightens in final ascent; no figurative tangles confuse the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense yet propulsive; occasional stacked metaphors (“silver fractures,” “fractured luminescence”) flirt with overwriting but serve the Accumulative lens; no loops or scaffold, and the final line’s cadence seals the vow cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose is dense, propulsive, and almost loop-free; only a faint echo—“tidal arbor swayed gently, a refuge secured”—leans close to redundancy. Metaphors are coherent, never contradictory. Sentence rhythm modulates with urgency; no filter-verb clusters or scaffold. Minor tightening could excise two near-repetitions of “refuge.”

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density: each phrase carries sensory, tool, and emotional load with minimal scaffold. A single mixed metaphor (“doubt gnawed luminous”) sparks 0.1 off.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density as "acid-laced dust penetrated cell walls" conveys decay and character shift. Minor register drift in "preprocess reality" (academic term) disrupts voice in peak beat, but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero closure-touching artifacts; high density with "frost etching crystalline veins" doing triple duty. Minor paraphrase loop ("fractured thoughts"/"shattered remnants") deducts 0.2—no impact on escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in "terror of capsize, grief for lost shipmates" summary; otherwise crystalline propulsion—thermal gradients "danced like silent notes" avoids metaphor muddle while advancing plot.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold loops; sentences like "He placed the lens... refract not light, but signals" achieve triple duty. Minor density issue: "warped beam" slightly generic amid otherwise precise diction. Final image’s "ocean’s hush enveloping him like a shroud" delivers crystalline propulsion without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with minimal scaffold, yet "gently persistent" (5x) and "amplified quiet" (4x) create subtle synonym loops; "tarnished but resonant" shows strong verbs, but lyrical repetitions in high-pressure beats slightly dull closure's immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong textural specificity ("petals like stars," "foggy waves of lucidity") but filter-verb clusters ("felt the pull," "felt whole") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Opening/closing lines anchor voice with precise image-to-action shift.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances density ("threads unraveling like overexposed film"). Figurative language serves pressure without muddle; rhythm varies naturally (short bursts during panic). "Retrocognitively trapped" slightly jargon-y but context-justified.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Figurative density risks overwriting in the decoding beat ("weaving through possibilities like a vine seeking light"), though rhythm control during the invaders' arrival ("boots crunching over shattered glass") remains taut.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every phrase multiplies meaning ("skeletal hulls of ancient shipwrecks that whispered secrets to the waves" establishes setting, mood, and constraint). Only microscopic flaw: "itch of renewal" borders on cliché in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor overwriting in opening ("fleeting golden sunset" → "moonlight began to claim the sky" density) and near-synonym loops ("luminous disbelief" x3) reduce propulsion; final image’s "forever altered" edges toward abstraction but avoids closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold loops; propulsion via concrete verbs ("twirled," "lapped"). Slight overwriting in "reluctant tears" and "thunderous applause" near closure, but metaphors serve pressure without muddling cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor scaffold in "betrayal had been transformative" slightly dulls momentum, but prose stays lean and sensorially precise ("cracked and yellowed cast," "disorienting chorus"); no loops in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.1)
    Zero scaffold loops and high density, but stacked metaphors in climax ("flakes drifted like autumn leaves... enriching hush") blur cost legibility. Propulsion falters slightly in overwrought beats, yet closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with clear propulsion—"notes emerging not from strings but from resonance of looped memories" does triple duty—but "looped timelines" appears 4x with near-synonym repetition (e.g., "cycles," "repeating days"). No figurative muddle in peak beats; final line ("remarkably composed, now whole") resolves with perfect textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Overwritten phrases like "shimmering facets like unspoken regrets" clutter high-tension moments; synonym loops ("resonant hush"/"gentle symphony") trigger -0.4 template-cadence penalty in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences like "skin like dried bark, hands gnarled from years of tending vines that clung to trellises like desperate lovers" achieve high density. Minor abstraction in "whispered thanks for deception's birth" costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density in sensory prose, but "subdued awakenings" repetition (3x) creates paraphrase loops. "Holographic principles" explanation mid-climax introduces scaffold; no artifacts dull closure but minor cadence stiffness in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless density ("water damage spread like inkblots, not ruining but transforming") but minor paraphrase loop with "lately inspired" and slight redundancy in final line ("once again"). No closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless rhythm and density, but "morning's reluctant gray" anthropomorphizes weakly; no loops or scaffold, and final line ("dawn's fading light") powerfully recharges opening aurora.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density and concrete verbs prevail, but paraphrase loops mar momentum: "drowsy alertness" repeats identically in three beats, and "swallowed truth" metaphor recurs without meaningful variation, triggering a -0.4 loop penalty in high-pressure sections.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose excels in textural specificity ("obsidian slowly eroded under the river's gentle lap") but suffers paraphrase loops: "cryptic folds" repeats four times with minimal variation, and "regenerative silence" appears verbatim thrice, dulling momentum in mid-beats.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.3)
    No loops or scaffold, but "cautious exuberance" label in peak beats triggers minor therapy-speak penalty; otherwise, lyrical density serves momentum without muddying closure's corona-lit locket moment.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor synonym loops ("sensitively perceptive" x2) and elevated diction ("unspoken narratives") in mid-beat; no closure-dulling artifacts, but filter-verb stacks ("he sensed," "he felt") slightly dilute immediacy during discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero scaffolding; "pulsed with potential" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Final line’s "enigma into enlightenment" achieves crystalline rhythmic control without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Two paraphrase loops ("unraveled stillness manifested... Time was slipping" / "plumbed deeper... probing like a diver") dull momentum in escalation beats, preventing 8.8+ despite otherwise clean propulsion and strategic figurative restraint.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-loop in "whispering secrets of growth and recursion" followed by "method to unlock the path" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise impeccable density and rhythm serve the high-pressure ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "tablet cracking under strain" metaphor maintains coherence through climax; final line "mortal, free" achieves maximum density without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    No loops or scaffold; "filament of hush" evolves meaningfully across beats. Final line’s "echoing silently" delivers conceptual cost cleanly. Minor deduction for "hushed cascades" / "hush of his own muted world" proximity (−0.2), but no closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with vivid textural specificity ("frayed parchment, edges"), but "layers of calm" cliché in closure beat slightly dulls the final image's propulsion under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "genetic whispers" and "crystal shadows" show textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "symphony of revival and loss" and "whirlpools of memory" slightly muddles two peak beats, preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.3)
    Near-flawless propulsion, but "subtle passion... quiet fire" repetition in para 5 creates a paraphrase loop (-0.2). No closure artifacts; "frayed by choices yet resilient" delivers crystalline resonance without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero scaffolding; every phrase multiplies meaning: "chronic hush fracturing like thin ice" merges metaphor and causality. Final line "elegant in its eternal incompletion" avoids sentimentality through concrete texture.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops; "sparks dancing like fireflies" serves static motif without muddle. Overwriting near climax ("bittersweet longing... shadowed by inevitable loss") slightly dilutes momentum, but closure beat ("calm river") remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "cautious exuberance bubbling up; he wasn't one to meddle" creates paraphrase loop; otherwise high-density prose with rhythmic variation, though "enduring tapestry" edges toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.7)
    Figurative muddle in peak beats: "luminescent ache" repeated 4× without evolution. Template cadence in search sequence ("One found... another uncovered") dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("compressed a storm" shows time-sculpting). Slight overwriting in "perpetual twilight" weakens momentum, but "shattered, uncaging the bird in a burst of resonant waves" achieves crystalline propulsion. Final line's semicolon use enhances closure rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor scaffold in "Elias, a man of whispers..." slightly tells rather than shows. Otherwise exceptional density: "drip-drip... feeding the trees that bowed" compresses setting, action, and metaphor without loops. No closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with rhythmic propulsion ("callused yet kind, sifted through layers"), but "ethereal veils" and "forbidden whisper" verge on stock metaphor; no closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    "Panic rose, but so did curiosity" creates minor paraphrase loop with following sentence in high-pressure beat; otherwise impeccable rhythm and zero figurative muddle despite dense imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("haggard awe" x3) and filter verbs in high-pressure beats dull immediacy. Strength: rhythmic control in storm sequence ("rain hammered... rivulets snaking") avoids overwriting; final line cliché ("bitter harvest") barely escapes penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor synonym churn in "steadily unpredictable" repetitions (×4) and "overlapping shadows" (×3) slightly dulls closure momentum; otherwise high density with zero figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "tarnished brass piece, curved and intricate" with concrete propulsion, though "weariness of absence" slightly overwrites emotional specificity in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.2)
    No fatal loops, but "trembling certainty" synonym churn and therapy-speak ("mapping escapes instead of facing pain") in peak beats trigger minor artifacts; prose propulsion falters during ticket-punching sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with high density, but paraphrase loop ("sculpt space for reflection"/"carving out a quiet haven") triggers -0.2 deduction; "unbreakable sibling love" slightly stock phrasing adds minor scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.5)
    High density succeeds ("fractured light and shadowed crystals"), yet "hushed thunder" repetition crosses into scaffold—four uses dilute tension without pattern payoff. No closure artifacts, but near-duplicate phrasing ("whispered thunder"/"hushed thunderclap") impedes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "buzzing with hum of refrigeration units and faint electric pulse" achieves triple-duty density. Final line's "scales finally even" crystallizes closure without sentimentality. One hairline overwriting in "sly grin that charmed victims."

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless density; minor overwriting in "petals refracting first light in prismatic whispers" where "prismatic" slightly muddles refraction mechanics without payoff, avoiding closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong textural specificity ("brittle like old parchment") marred by scaffold loops: "filtering reality differently" repeats 4x with minimal variation, creating synonym churn that slightly dulls the closure beat’s impact.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Filter-verb stacks ("began to hum," "felt a subtle vibration") cluster in the cello beat, dulling immediacy; redundant phrasing ("vibrant with swirling blues and golds" + "painted seashell") triggers Text Artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "coiled serpent meant 'gather supplies at dawn'" doing triple duty. Final line's explanatory "proving" slightly dulls closure image, but "foundation stone chip gleamed under lantern light" offers textural specificity. No figurative muddle—metaphors serve pressure (e.g., "gentrification crept in subtly").

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.4)
    "Melancholy tugged at her heart" embodies generic cliché; "solitary guardian" in closure beat dulls final image. Minor scaffold in reflection blocks (e.g., "her purposefully curious mind wandered") incur -0.5 artifact penalty touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Magnetic calm" repeats as template cadence (3x), dulling propulsion; otherwise crystalline prose—"iridescent wings crumpled" shows textural specificity without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("universe’s own etch-a-sketch" crystallizing method) with clear propulsion, though "subtly confident" repetition in high-pressure beats slightly dulls immediacy without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density and propulsion, but "wild hush" recurs four times with diminishing returns; "vines crept slower" exemplifies vague abstraction in high-pressure beats. Final line ("runes glowing faintly") crystallizes closure without muddle, though minor scaffold dulls mid-story momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-zero scaffolding; sentences like "breathing slowly, deliberately, against the tide of fear" advance character and pressure. Minor deduction for "impossible in aqueous realm" logic hiccup, but closure remains sharp. Figurative language sparse in climax, avoiding overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero paraphrase loops; high density ("sky bled hues of burnished metal"). Elevated diction in "sustains impossibilities" slightly jars during high-pressure ghost encounter, but final image avoids sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with rhythmic propulsion ("Elias pressed on, motivated by the debt’s pull"), but paraphrase loops ("ephemeral cameo" x4) and synonym churn ("fleeting as a dream’s edge," "ghosted away") trigger -0.3 deduction. No closure artifacts, but "cascade of resonant awakenings" lacks textural specificity in climax.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    No prose artifacts; sentences advance imagery ("threading verses into nets that caught not fish, but fleeting dreams"). Figurative language serves theme ("mending a fractured world with golden threads"), though "hauntingly optimistic" borders on label but is immediately embodied through action. Closure beat remains vivid and clean.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion with vivid specificity, but paraphrase loops ("purposeful wandering" x4) and template cadence in reflection paragraphs dull closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold in "deliberate pace of yesteryear" / "deliberate act" repetition. High density otherwise with rhythmic control in dawn sequences. No closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.6)
    Overwriting in "casting elongated shadows that echoed the silence of impending secrets" muddles physical logic; paraphrase loops ("echoed silence" repeated 4x) dull closure’s propulsion despite vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density in peak beats risks overwriting ("grooves that once channeled storms from cathedral eaves"), but cadence shifts (short sentences during blood ritual) propel momentum; minor scaffold in "fragile limbo before a choice hardened into fate" deducts.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with propulsion but minor synonym churn ("tangled minds"/"emotional knots") in shrapnel reference. "Tender sorrow blooming" risks purple prose yet redeemed by context. Final line’s "enduring light" avoids closure muddle through concrete reprise of coral’s symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density ("flickering images of bountiful harvests" compresses time); "pensive mirth" phrase loop in climax (-0.1) slightly dilutes propulsion but closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    "Thoughts taxed into confusion" uses diagnostic label in high-pressure beat (-0.5 artifact penalty). Otherwise strong propulsion; "flickering ember of rebellion" avoids cliché through concrete entomological framing.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.8)
    Template cadence ("shyly unstoppable" variants) and stock metaphors ("thorns of suffering") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy; final image rescues density with concrete nebula-flower fusion.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.8)
    Overwriting in high-pressure beats: "foxglove regret" scaffold (4x) and template cadence ("Gently, systematically...") dull immediacy; final-third artifacts prevent 9+ despite otherwise strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Overwriting in "ethereal harmonies woven from extinct dialects" obscures causality; mixed metaphor ("bubbling as promises fused") dulls closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Template cadence in "On one side... On the other..." triggers -0.4 loop penalty. Filter-verb stack ("Elias felt... realized... knew") in closure beat obscures embodied cost, disallowing 9+ globally.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion and specificity marred by paraphrase loops ("isolation had bloomed... spirit curling like dried petals") and template cadence in mapping sequences, though closure beat remains artifact-free.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor overwriting ("unraveled the threads of their lives like a butterfly's wing stirring a storm" risks mixed metaphor) but zero closure artifacts; high density maintained except brief thematic echo in "necessary distances" section.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.7)
    Minor scaffold in setup ("she was a landscape astrologer"); "veils of mystery" risks purple prose, though the final image’s "char softened" delivers crystalline propulsion without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "pollen-dusted memories of waves crashing" achieves triple density. Final line crystallizes theme without muddle: "joy with the gentle ache of what remains unseen" avoids figurative clutter in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean propulsion with sparse loops, but scaffold appears: "Elias, the analytical street performer, thrived..." tells rather than shows. Template cadence in setup ("where... where...") and near-closure repetition of "lightly attentive" dilute momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor overwriting in "obsidian-graced sanctuary" and "iridescent core" slightly dulls momentum, but final image clarity remains uncompromised; no loops or scaffold in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("surface like a mirror to the awakening sky") does triple duty (setting/atmosphere/theme); final line ("forever changed by the pond's whispered wisdom") recharges motif without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion but "bargained bits of her youth" suffers therapy-speak label artifact in high-pressure beat. No closure-impacting loops, but minor overwriting in "performing its slow dance" opening.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor synonym churn: "serene upheaval" repeated 3x without deepening. "Trial balloons" phrasing slightly mechanical. No figurative muddle, but final line's "serene disruption" echoes earlier without escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; "scent of decay and salt, a reminder of how shifts had turned rivers into invaders" has minor paraphrase redundancy. High density where "half-burned diaries" simultaneously advance plot, character, and theme without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffolding; "shimmering figures on the air itself" exemplifies dual-purpose prose. Template cadence in "He painted... His perceptively calm eyes..." triggers -0.2. No closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.6)
    Template cadence in ritual beats ("began... whispering... tracing") triggers scaffold penalty. Near-closure escape: "vitality siphoned" avoids figurative muddle, but synonym loops ("flawed beauty" repetition) disallow 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density ("thunder rumbled faintly, then hushed") yet scaffold loop: "fractured grace" appears verbatim in paragraphs 4, 6, 7, dulling closure's emotional charge despite strong verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=5.9)
    Crippling synonym churn: "alarming serenity" (5x) and "bodily poetic" (4x) create paraphrase loops. Final beat's "whirlwind of awakening" suffers mixed metaphor (serenity shattering into wind), dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong propulsion overall, but synonym churn in the reflection paragraph ("cracked open doubts... revealing half-lit epiphanies—those partial revelations") creates a minor scaffold loop that dulls the pivotal turn.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.9)
    Overwritten repetitions ("blushing stillness" ×3) and template cadence in high-pressure beats ("With careful fingers... humming... notes rose") dull immediacy; final paragraph's filter-verb stack ("Elias felt... loosening... ready") triggers the -0.5 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density with zero figurative muddle, but paraphrase loop in paragraph 5 ("guilt into resolve... self-reproach chain... snowmelt ardor") restates emotional shift redundantly. Closure beat pristine; artifacts don't touch final image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong textural specificity ("wafer seal, thin and brittle") yet adjacent paraphrase loops ("decay of old directives, freeing space for new growth"/"let directives decay and rebirth begin") dull closure beat; minor register drift ("precisely playful murmur") in high-pressure dream sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; "dwindled like fading constellations" compresses backstory with momentum. Strategic telling avoids summarizing pivotal beats. Borderline purple prose in "shimmering rift where empirical data twisted" risks muddling but saved by context.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.5)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "walls dissolving into mist and reforming" integrates action with atmosphere. Minor overwriting ("colors bleeding into new hues") in early beats, but zero loops in closure sequence maintains clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("frost painted gnarled branches in silvery hues" conveys setting, time, and emotion) with propulsion through varied syntax, though "ethereal flutter" slightly drifts into elevated diction without POV justification in a peak beat, narrowly avoiding artifact penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor scaffold in "grief-fogged mind" slightly dulls momentum; otherwise, zero loops and high density—though "rustled trowel" typo risks artifact penalty without closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose flows with strong textural specificity ("petals drifted like snow in zero gravity"), but minor scaffold appears: "blossoms unfurling... blossoms cast a hopeful glow" creates paraphrase-loop redundancy. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet rhythmic propulsion falters in reflective stretches near the midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("carefully resourceful," symphony repetitions) and final-paragraph purple prose ("alliances forged in gaps") dull closure's propulsion without breaking coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "vibrant greens evoked unkindled solace" line; no figurative muddle despite lyrical compression, closure image crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density but 2-3 lines of scaffolding: "her motivation burned clear: to translate confusion into clarity" tells rather than shows. Near-closure, "Clarity bloomed... unanswered voids" leans abstract. Strengths: strong verbs ("coalesced," "groaned"), purposeful paragraph cuts. No loops, but minor register drift in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; lines like "waves of quiet rippled outward, mirroring the maps Elara kept" fuse action, theme, and character. Figurative language clarifies pressure (chaos as "hammering blows"), and the final line recharges the opening’s storm with earned cadence—no muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Overwriting in "fragile hopes like thistles blown across barren fields, resilient yet adrift" creates density clash. Synonym loop ("resilient yet adrift" after "thistle-blown hope") slightly dulls closure image despite strong propulsion elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("preemptively nostalgic" variants) and slight overwriting in atmospheric beats. No closure artifacts, but synonym churn in middle section triggers -0.4 penalty under tightened Q7 rules.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong propulsion in discovery sequence, but filter-verb stack ("he had heard... seemed... murmured") dulls immediacy; "vibrant defiance against decay" overwrites with mixed metaphor in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "warmly observant" repetition (3x) and borderline purple prose ("silence bloomed, vast and uncharted") cost 0.4. No loops in climax, but "rough grains and smooth passages" slightly overwrites texture concept without deepening pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "intangibly tangible" repetition risks stock phrasing but earns cohesion through Charged Poise payoff. Minor overwriting in "velvety mute of cloud-shadows" compensated by strong verbs like "sprouting it by whispering a barrier spell".

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose achieves lyrical density ("crystalline platforms floated like shards of captured rainbow"), but scaffold phrases like "recounting betrayals and bustling cities" dilute momentum. Crucially, no artifacts obscure the closure image—Mira’s "shoulders relax" lands with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "faded murals of kings and queens" followed by "faded murals" repetition; otherwise vivid propulsion—"peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals" avoids purple prose despite high-density imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.5)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "she raised her hand, the lion’s head glinting" compresses action/image. Minor density issue—"tender shadow keeper" descriptor feels abstract early—but closure beat ("shadows settled peacefully") avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; "pressure mounted, physical and metaphorical" does double duty. Final line crystallizes theme without muddle. Hairline flaw: "resonant click" slightly clichéd amid otherwise precise propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops in closure beat, but "unvoiced narratives, yet now amplified" shows paraphrase redundancy; overwriting in "harmonious secrecy" slightly dulls momentum despite otherwise purposeful density.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.8)
    "Shivering bliss" repetition creates paraphrase loops in climax; "reality shifted" cadence runs dull immediacy. Final-beat artifacts disallow 9+ globally per policy.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion with sparse loops, though "puffing into the air like a sigh from the past" edges toward cliché in closure beat; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently without momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops ("unrevised histories" x2 near climax) and template cadence in opening ("She was...") dull immediacy. No closure artifacts; minor scaffold in reflection block prevents 8.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor synonym churn in "eerie nostalgia" repetitions (4x) slightly dulls closure; otherwise high density with strong verbs ("pierced," "smothered"), though "quietly vivid" descriptors risk thematic echo in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.3)
    Figurative density overwhelms peak beats: "whispered secrets amid gray-clouded heights" stacks metaphors without payoff; template cadence ("She spent... ensuring... The arbor...") dulls immediacy in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero paraphrase loops; propulsion through concrete verbs ("brushed," "swung," "leapt"); slight overwriting in "defiantly gleaming gold" risks figurative muddle but avoids closure impact; strategic telling compresses backstory efficiently without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with propulsion ("Sweat beaded... melting gold infused with stardust"), but "luminous regret" repetition creates subtle synonym churn in peak beats. No closure-dulling artifacts, yet minor scaffold in reflective passages prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor synonym loops in closure ("luminous ache" → "luminous ache lifted") risk dilution, yet propulsion remains sharp; harp mechanics are conveyed through concrete action ("plucked the strings, sending forth notes") avoiding overwriting despite lyrical density.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion through concrete verbs ("unfastening like knots," "cascade of light"). Slight overwriting risk in "eternal instant" repetition is mitigated by payoff, but "elusively tangible" recurrence borders on density strain without deeper variation in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero scaffold/loops; high density ("translucent fissures revealing glimpses of mortal pains" compresses backstory). "Weightless burden" avoids abstraction via "like regrets carried on a breeze." Minor register drift: "ethereal heaviness" borders therapy-speak but redeemed by concrete simile.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with clear propulsion, but "rustling awakenings" appears 4x with near-synonym churn ("stirrings," "stirred," "stirring"). No closure muddle, yet paraphrase loop in paragraph 5 ("awakening echoes... rustle like leaves") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.8)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("burnished sorrow" repetition) and slightly elevated diction in reflective beats; offset by crystalline closure propulsion where "shard clutched like a talisman" recharges the opening’s decay imagery without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose soars with "echoes danced like fireflies," yet "method of mending what isn’t torn" is abstract label, not demonstrated action. Overwriting in climax ("inky tendrils seeping through cracks") dulls immediacy, and template cadence ("He began by... Now came...") weakens propulsion in the final third.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.1)
    "Sensibly, she had packed..." tells rather than shows preparation, creating scaffold. No fatal artifacts, but "cool water embracing her like an old friend" slightly overwrites the swim beat, diluting embodied sensation in peak pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is lush yet precise ("foam crashed below," "ethereal scenes"), but synonym loops ("perpetually learning, devouring books... perpetually learning ignited") and four "turbine-hum" repetitions in climax slightly muddle momentum without breaking closure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops in peak beats with exquisite propulsion ("light pierced... casting shadows that danced with tenderness"). Near-flawless density, though "tears came softly as Elara reckoned with it all" contains adjacent "reckon" variants (-0.2 scaffold) preventing 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero paraphrase loops; "air tasted of salt and regret" achieves high density. Minor scaffold in "reverie burning hotter" repetition, but closure beat ("gasped amid swaying bookshelves") avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful lyricism ('faded lanterns like forgotten dreams'), but 'deceitful allure' edges toward cliché; no closure-impairing loops.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs (“dislodging overripe apples,” “vines creeping downward”). Final line (“guardian of whispers that could reshape reality”) recharges wax motif with precision. Figurative language sparse but potent (“disquiet draped like velvet shroud”); no muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density falters in climax: "wild serenity" repeats 3x within 10 lines, dulling closure image despite otherwise precise lyrical control.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful rhythm, but "doubt flickered" and "microclimates swirling like hidden currents" introduce slight scaffold and mixed metaphor in the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Template cadence ("Through the hush...") and synonym churn ("flourishing stillness" ×3) in final third dull closure image. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she sensed") in climax trigger -0.5 artifact penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "splintered by relentless heat" and "vigilant hum" showcase textural specificity. Every line advances atmosphere or character, with metaphors serving POV ("danced like memories"). Final line recharges "mute eloquence" motif without stating meaning, achieving propulsion and density.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose avoids major artifacts, with strong specificity in the climax ("rough silk of seconds"). Minor synonym loops ("whispers... whispers of anticipated mysteries") and one abstract phrase ("rediscovered the essence") slightly muddle closure’s charge, but propulsion remains clean and sensory density high.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose avoids loops with high density ("footsteps soft as unspoken verses"), but "burnished hush" overuse risks purple prose in the climax. Rhythm varies effectively (short phrases for tension: "ragged breathing"), yet the grammatical slip "warmth pulse" slightly dulls closure clarity, preventing 9.0 despite otherwise clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor scaffold in "methodically, he wrapped... twisting it in spirals" dilutes propulsion; "veins in living stone" contains biological inaccuracy (veins don’t spiral), slightly muddling closure’s physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "dusty footprints emerging ahead, as if imprinted by invisible travelers" exemplifies high-density imagery, though slight repetition in "glistening" surfaces risks minor scaffold but avoids closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor scaffold in "after the reef died" repetition; otherwise high density with zero figurative muddle. Strategic telling compresses backstory without momentum loss. Final image's "waves lapping at new growth" avoids cliché through concrete charge.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero scaffold/loops; propulsion through concrete verbs ("unearthed," "traced," "surged"). But "intuitively descriptive" appears twice as label (para 3, 6), bordering on therapy-speak in peak beats. Final line's "chasing closeness" slightly over-polishes emotional charge, risking sentimentality.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose propulsion flawless: "flickering holograms, frozen in the aftermath" compresses backstory without scaffold. Minor density hit—"confusion started to morph into exploration" uses weak "morph" verb, muddying high-pressure beat. No loops or artifacts in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but density issues: "frost clung like a jealous lover" and "heart pounding yet steps deliberate" risk overwriting in high-pressure beats. No closure-impacting loops, though "cautious abandon" repetition slightly dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; final line ("benevolence triumphing through ruthless will") crystallizes theme with propulsion. Near-miss: "benevolently ruthless drive: kind in intent..." uses a colon that risks academic register, but voice cohesion prevents dilution.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "roots breaking through soil long fallow" crystallizes surge without muddle. High density in climax ("visions flooded her—not false ones... raw truths") with clear propulsion to dawn resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops; "fidgeted productively" appears four times as motif-driven escalation, not redundancy. Sentences vary rhythm to mirror tension—short during decoding, lyrical at closure ("time stirring like a sleeper awakening"). No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "forged hush" repetition in opening paragraph slightly loops but pays off through textural deepening. Zero figurative muddle in peak beats like the mist visions.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with "molten lacquer in kintsugi" doing triple duty, but "quilting memories into cohesive tapestry" creates mixed metaphor (quilting/tapestry) triggering -0.3 coherence penalty. No closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong textural specificity but "heart screaming tenderness" in climax uses therapy-speak label where embodied action was required, dulling closure image per Q7 penalty rules.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels action ("hammered pins," "scribbled notes"). Textural specificity dominates ("greenish hue speaking of centuries exposed to sacred smoke"). One near-miss: "vibrating softly now, promising stronger pulses" slightly anthropomorphizes gears – a hairline flaw preventing 9.0 in peak construction beat.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero prose artifacts: "fractured grace" crystallizes closure without figurative muddle. Every sentence advances story ("boots sinking into mossy ropes" establishes setting/mood simultaneously). High density in ritual beat—truffle crushing/anointing—avoids overwriting while propelling toward Charged Poise.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose shines in atmospheric density ("nautical twilight," "opal waves"), but "softly persistent" recurs as scaffold (3+ lines) in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Minor synonym churn ("borrowed memories," "fractured tale") near closure caps score.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    "As the creek rises" repeats verbatim three times (lines 15, 28, 36), creating a template-cadence loop that dulls immediacy in high-pressure beats. Otherwise pristine prose, but artifact in the final third disallows 9+ globally despite strong density and propulsion elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose propulsion falters slightly with "softly commanding" label repetition and "lacy menace" near-synonym churn, though final image redeems it. Filter-verb stacks in ritual description ("waiting for," "spotted," "released") dull immediacy in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    Zero scaffold in closure beat, but figurative density ("rivers of smoldering coals converged into a pulsating hub") risks muddling causality in the Ember Nexus description early on.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "snow blanketed the world in indifferent white" exemplifies textural specificity. One paraphrase echo ("wild torrents... tame the wild torrents") deducts 0.2 despite masterful propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("trembling calm amid inner turmoil" charges emotion/atmosphere). Figurative language sparse but purposeful in closure beat ("connection forged in the hush").

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong propulsion but paraphrase loop in high-pressure beat: "crystalline facets bloomed across her forearms like frost on glass" followed by "crystals locked her movements" duplicates imagery. Near-synonym churn ("shed them"/"shatter her skin") slightly dulls closure’s tactile immediacy despite vivid overall craft.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density in sensory lines ("notes clashing like old grudges") falters with minor synonym loops ("imperfect and raw," "imperfect miracle"); final paragraph's thematic echo ("hush lingered... axes fell") dulls closure precision.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.6)
    Figurative density risks muddling climax ("veils tearing in silent symphony"); minor scaffold in "empires crumbling, stars winking out" dilutes propulsion despite otherwise vivid specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose achieves zero loops and maximal density: every line advances atmosphere or theme (e.g., "bubbles rising downward" crystallizes the core concept). Final image ("fjord lay still") recharges the quiet motif with crystalline clarity. No figurative muddle; rhythm varies naturally from flowing to fragmented during the counting sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density in sensory details ("humid embrace," "fleeting blue hues"), but "quiet wildfire" recurs 3x in final 100 words as template cadence, dulling immediacy during the critical barrier-repair beat.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful specifics ("iridescent mica pane"), but "theoretically rebellious" appears in identical constructions (template cadence) and library description leans generic, creating minor scaffold that dulls mid-beat momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence propels atmosphere or character. "Melodically haunted" motif gains precision through repetition. Final line achieves image-based charge without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "diluted the ink with jetty water, stirring until..." exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor deduction: "proximate causes" repetition (3x) slightly dilutes momentum in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor density issues ("improbable rumor chains" repetition) and cliché ("whispered in the winds of rumor") in setup; tightens beautifully by climax. Zero artifacts in peak beats where it matters.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold, yet "shores of unresolved longing" strains metaphor coherence in a high-pressure beat, slightly dulling the grief-storm’s visceral charge.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero paraphrase loops; "fractal patterns mimicking cosmic webs" shows textural specificity. Minor overwriting in "whispers from the cosmos" (redundant with "radio waves") dulls momentum but doesn’t obscure closure’s pen-unbending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.5)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "waves lapped... quiet symphony" merges setting/action. Minor loop: "quiet" repeated 11x dilutes tension in mid-beats. No closure-dulling artifacts; final line’s "signs... lingering" recharges camera motif with zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density but figurative muddle in peak beats: "volcanic tenderness... tender as lava cooling" strains metaphor. Template cadence in discovery sequence ("First... There... Following") dulls immediacy without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.0)
    Template cadence in drumming sequence ("she drummed... she drummed...") triggers -0.5; "auroral sorrow" as therapy-speak label in peak beats (-0.6); artifacts in final third disallow 9+ globally per Q7 rules.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold, but "serpentine route glowing faintly" introduces a minor figurative muddle in a high-pressure beat, preventing 8.8+ despite strong propulsion elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    "Spiralingly calm" repetition (4x) creates minor synonym churn in high-pressure beats, slightly muddying momentum. Strong propulsion otherwise, but loop artifacts in the final third prevent 9+ eligibility per Text Artifact Screen.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density falters with near-synonym loops ("hush first revealed itself"/"hush grew denser") and elevated diction ("ethereal twilight," "foreshadows of fate") in high-pressure beats, risking overwriting. Final image ("forests he planted flourished") avoids muddle, but template cadence ("He possessed... It was this gift...") in early paragraphs dulls immediacy. No closure-impacting artifacts, though momentum dips slightly during grotto reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; lyrical density ("fists unclenched into open palms") advances atmosphere without muddle. Final line’s "unlocking hope" resonates without overwriting. Peak beats (transformation) sustain propulsion through strong verbs ("shifting," "faded").

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops; sentences do triple duty (e.g., "knife etching finer details" shows action/tool/emotion). Final line’s cadence ("chasing lightness...") crystallizes theme without muddle. Minor "remade hush" repetition avoided penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor overwriting in "aesthetically driven" repetitions slightly muddles peak beats, but high density ("footsteps muffled in lantern-moth hush") and no closure artifacts; propulsion falters only in abstract conceptual phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or artifacts; every line propels with high density ("horror gripped him" cuts scaffold). Final line’s crystalline closure ("cracks in glass held stories") avoids figurative muddle, and rhythm varies organically from ritual to climax.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor overwriting in opening ("echoes lingered like ghosts") distracts, but propulsion accelerates in climax; no closure-dulling loops, though "powerfully gentle" appears 3x without variation.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high density with minimal scaffold; "synthetic vellum that mimicked human skin" exemplifies textural specificity. Overwriting risk in "ethereal drapes woven from forgotten dreams" slightly muddles causality but is redeemed by the observatory's established lyric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "raindrops traced erratic lines down the skylight like tears on a forgotten ledger" achieves high density with dual sensory/metaphorical work. Minor deduction for "steadily curious" appearing twice without variation, slightly dulling the final beat's immediacy despite otherwise flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Overwriting in climax ("iridescent clouds... purifying flames") muddles causality; "anguished joy" repetition creates paraphrase loop. Final line ("beautiful ache") rescues closure beat from density penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Softly deliberate" repeats four times as scaffold; lyrical density occasionally muddles action ("coaxing secrets from fading light" during high-stakes shadow confrontation).

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("sands inside glowing faintly" → "sands defy gravity"); minor deduction for "profound silence" cliché in high-pressure opening beat.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    No scaffold loops; "hushed thunder" metaphor evolves organically. Slight density spike in "rooms within rooms unfolding" but payoff justifies. Closure beat pristine.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    "Shadowed rapture" appears 3x with paraphrase loops (-0.3); "unspoken words" repetition lacks pattern-teaching. Strong verbs ("whirring softly," "birthing poems") offset density issues in non-closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful variation ("pulsed like forgotten heartbeats"), but "methoded his enchantment" creates lexical jarring. No loops or scaffold; final line ("hope took root") resolves with textural precision, though minor muddles persist in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line advances atmosphere or insight ("leaves whirred with precision of fan blades" does triple duty). Final line recharges "wind whispered" motif with crystalline clarity, avoiding figurative muddle even in high-pressure unraveling beat.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    "Gently persistent" repetition creates paraphrase loops (-0.3), and "fog thickened" followed by "fog that danced" muddles causality; otherwise, rhythm varies purposefully with strong verbs ("cradling," "skirting") until final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero momentum-drag loops; high density ("snow sifted through cracks like whispered secrets"). Slight artifact: "seraphically mundane" repeats as near-synonym (para 5, 10), risking thematic echo but not muddying closure. Final line’s cadence shift ("spark against the cold") propels closure flawlessly.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero scaffold or loops; high density ("shards of deceit floating away" crystallizes cost). Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("fractured like fine porcelain" vs. "chandelier collapsing") creates slight metaphor friction without muddling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with propulsion ("rain pelted the pod's dome, Elara rummaged"), but minor scaffold in "memories etched with ghostly white skeletons" slightly dulls immediacy; no closure-impacting artifacts despite lyrical compression.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lush descriptions marred by scaffold loops ("thunderous serenity" repetition) and template cadence in paragraph 3. Near-closure filter-verb stack ("she understood... visions flooded") dulls immediacy without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density with propulsion ("bubbles popped like secrets surfacing"), but "trembling hands" cliché and redundant "whisper unbidden thoughts" scaffold dilute climax. No closure-touched artifacts, yet near-miss figurative muddle in decoding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    "Crumpled photograph" repetition creates minor synonym loop in high-pressure beat; otherwise clean propulsion—final line "ready to face whatever came next" slightly generic after lyrical prose.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density overall, but "luminescent ache" recurs with slight variation in closure beat, nudging toward loop. Opening line anchors voice ("shelves curved like spine of weary giant"), yet phrases like "weaver’s nightmare" slightly blur causality. Final line powerfully recharges rhetorical motif.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.3)
    Rich rhythm with purposeful variation, but "breathing mandalas" overwrites and "fury simmered like distant storm" cliché muddles high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density ("dormant networks pulsed faintly in the monitors"). "Dizzying quiet" repetition is purposeful motif, not artifact. Slight overwriting in "explosive revelations, banned by the overseers above who maintained societal order through enforced ignorance" bloats momentum. Final line achieves textural specificity with "unspoken words finally finding voice."

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops ("weave continuity") and mixed metaphor "tranquil blaze" slightly muddle peak beats; no artifacts in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dense imagery occasionally borders on overwriting ("luminous forms drifting dreamily" risks cadence slack), but propulsion remains strong. Minor paraphrase loop in "wild and soothing, like a beast crooning" slightly dulls immediacy; otherwise, concrete verbs ("pierced," "reeling") and purposeful fragments advance momentum without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "she felt the pull stronger than ever" followed by "tonight, motivated by..." dilutes propulsion. Otherwise high density: "errant planets" compresses legacy weight. No closure artifacts; cadence varies with emotional urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but "dissonance of old guilt that clawed at her soul" suffers mixed metaphor. Template cadence in ritual description ("She pried... unveiling... watching...") slightly dulls immediacy. Closure prose achieves crystalline clarity ("amber’s insect as eternal witness"), avoiding final-third artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "violet tension that perfumed the fog" exemplifies textural specificity. One near-redundancy in "whispering gallery tile flake" repetition (beat 1 vs 3) slightly dulls momentum, but closure image ("lilac glow") remains sharp and uncluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("warm coldness" repeated verbatim near closure); otherwise high density with concrete propulsion. "Cradle empathy in arms of steel" recurrence lacks sufficient variation for peak-beat impact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high-density prose ("ripples in time fractured the timeline") propels momentum without muddle; final line’s "luminous possibility" recharges motifs with crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-zero loops; high density ("warm flush in palms" signals safety). One paraphrase loop ("fractally precise... self-similar and exact") prevents 9+. "Willowglass" fresh but "supple branches" risks mixed metaphor. Final line ("pathways lit with delicate, enduring light") avoids cliché with concrete charge.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "waves crashed... sending misty echoes" weaves action/atmosphere without scaffold. One borderline corporate phrase ("heat-map emotions function") slightly dilutes peak-beat immediacy, but final line's "echoed with potential" delivers crystalline closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops with high density, but "murmured incoherently, a jumble of tones" contains subtle redundancy; final image remains razor-sharp despite this micro-artifact in mid-beat.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops: "prudently daring" repeated verbatim 3x, "unused courage waits" duplicated; opening’s "silver hush... forgotten secrets" risks purple prose without payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "yarn needle hovered" shows via concrete action. Minor register drift in "percolate" risks abstraction but redeemed by "coffee brewing" simile. Closure beat ("heart unweighted") maintains propulsion without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density where "dust motes danced" and "smoke flattened" compress setting/character. "Sharp gentleness" risks abstraction but gains texture through "tender persistence edged with fragility."

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops, high density ("oars resting like patient sentinels" conveys image/tone/character), and clean propulsion; "heart a haven" risks sentimentality but redeemed by concrete prior execution, avoiding closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("isolation fracturing, piece by brittle piece") propels momentum without muddle, though "raw yolk of emotion" risks mixed metaphor in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "rainbows fracturing in droplets" exemplifying textural specificity. One borderline purple phrase ("serene shadow") prevents 9.0 but doesn’t dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "ethereal beings of light and shadow, scrambling in their distant realm" slightly dulls climax rhythm. Otherwise exceptional density: "subsonic interference neutralizing the tricksters' influence" compresses cause/effect without loss.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    Template cadence ("Elias moved... Elias paused... Elias felt") in climax beat dulls immediacy; synonym churn on "wistful rebellion" creates scaffold. Closure artifacts ("wistful rebellion lingered") trigger −0.7 penalty, disallowing 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong rhythmic control in quarry description, but "dormant empathy" and "awakened his own heart" verge on therapy-speak; repetitive "furrowed hush" phrasing creates minor scaffold loop in final beats, dulling closure’s immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong textural specificity ("barnacles, bloated pages") but "spongey dread" loops 5x with diminishing returns. Final paragraph's "rain pelted like insistent fingers" risks mixed metaphor; density muddles cost legibility in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.5)
    No prose loops or scaffold, but "luminous disbelief" recurs 3x with diminishing specificity, slightly dulling closure's emotional charge despite strong final image.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero scaffold loops with strong propulsion, but "dusky harmony" cadence risks monotony; figurative density ("sleeping beast") serves atmosphere without muddling closure, though "well-oiled mechanism" verges on cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold in reflective block ("As a lucid dream chronicler...") and two paraphrase loops ("chronicle the lucid dreams that visited her like faithful companions"/"recording visions that revealed hidden truths") dull momentum without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density falters in "trees lashing like living catapults" (spatial clash with prior spirals); minor scaffold in "guarded nature began to strain... but held serenity" dulls immediacy without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in setup ("her body a bridge...") slightly dulls momentum, but "maze topiary clipping" evolves with concrete specificity; no closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong rhythmic control falters in high-pressure beats: "half-lit corridors" repeats 4× with diminishing returns, and "dusky resolve" phrasing risks scaffold; near-closure line ("fiercely gentle in her victory") slightly overwrites the inherited torment's weight.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose dazzles with concrete specificity ("frayed—scrap of speaker grille cloth, black mesh dotted with tiny tears like starlit scars"), but "insulating emotionally with facts" appears twice as therapy-speak scaffold, muddying the climax beat.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "shimmered like stardust" avoids purple prose through context. Final line’s "perpetual transition" multiplies purpose while resolving momentum. Figurative language stays precise even in high-pressure beats like the fruit’s consumption.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=9.2)
    Near-flawless propulsion; "scattered across wet stone floor" varies syntax masterfully. One hairline slip: "swirling vortex of memories" slightly abstract in high-pressure beat, but no loops or artifacts dull closure.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor scaffold ("he inspected Bunker 47, a relic...") and synonym loops ("faint light"/"latent radiance") in mid-scene dilute momentum; no closure-dulling artifacts, but two distinct non-closure issues trigger -1.5 cap (7.8 = base 9.3 - 1.5).

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels with textural precision ("ivy rustled like whispers of absolution"). Figurative language serves theme without muddle, and the final line ("steps daring yet measured toward whatever bend lay ahead") crystallizes closure through concrete action. Peak beats maintain visceral immediacy—no filter verbs dull the accordion's halting melody.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Minor scaffold loops ("mulberry ache" x4) and slight overwriting in climax ("propagating perforated destinies") reduce density, but no closure damage. Strong textural specificity elsewhere; coffee grounds transition from ritual to literal soil component.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops; "static within Thorne" slightly abstracts physical sensation but avoids therapy-speak; every line advances texture (e.g., "brushes of feather-soft crystal" implying tool constraint), with final line’s "lucid watch" crystallizing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero scaffold/loops; "vineyard hush" recurrence earns purposeful density. Slight overwriting in "soft rustle of leaves that glowed faintly... hush broken only by soft snip of silk" risks paraphrase loop but saved by semantic shift from observation to ritual action.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in chime explanation ("high tinkles for hesitation...") and "hollow" repetition create slight density issues, but no closure artifacts. Propulsion remains strong with textural specificity ("sail-cloth cloak," "soft gold" dawn).

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.4)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; minor density dip in "manifested from the grotto's magnetic pull" slightly over-explains the vision but avoids muddling the pivotal revelation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "existence a testament to historically reverent traditions" (synonym churn). Otherwise high density: "faint smile cracking his weathered face" charges closure without muddle. No closure artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with strong verbs ("phase through ice walls"), but paraphrase loop in "brilliant dimness" repetition during climax ("making every movement feel both illuminated and obscured") creates minor scaffold without pressure escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.5)
    Minor figurative density in opening ("silent meteors in reverse" redundant with "fragile orbs") slightly dulls propulsion. Zero scaffold loops, but "meteor hush" repetition borders on overwriting; final line avoids thematic echo through concrete action ("lit them with new eyes").

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with clear propulsion. "Galaxies folded inward like crumpled parchment" risks slight overwriting in opening beat, but no closure-dulling artifacts. Final line's cadence shift elevates closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops; high density ("kaleidoscope of colors dancing across the atlas page"). But "prisms humming" overwrites—violates physical logic (prisms don’t hum) in peak beat, slightly dulling closure’s crystallization imagery. Otherwise flawless propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    Minor scaffold in "memories flooded him" reflection; "cosmic imbalance tilted fabric of reality" violates physical logic (mixed metaphor), dulling climax despite otherwise vivid "sapphire essence" prose.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "mirrored silence"/"mirrored hush" dulls closure beat. Otherwise, high density ("rooftops emerging like ghosts") and concrete verbs propel momentum. No figurative muddle, but final-third artifact disallows 9+ globally per guidelines.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero scaffold but near-overwriting in early metaphors ("prismatic mists danced like forgotten dreams"); density slightly obscures causality in setup though closure image remains sharp and propulsion intact.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density stumbles in adjacent paraphrase: "amplifying the isolation... isolation of her vigil" creates scaffold; otherwise, concrete propulsion ("strap, clip, leap") avoids figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; high density in vivification sequence. Minor register drift in "convoluted thread" slightly dulls closure's immediacy without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops with high density ("vein-like patterns," "scent of rain-soaked earth"), but "pulsing with unspoken potential" is cliché; minor figurative muddle in peak beats prevents 9.0 despite strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor overwriting in "turning them into haunting echoes that seeped upward" (redundant verbs). No loops or scaffold, but "seeped" alone would tighten momentum; final line achieves crystalline resonance without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "runes ignited softly" exemplifies multi-jobbing prose. Minor register drift in "lucid fog" risks thematic echo but avoids muddle. Final line’s "harmonious dance" delivers closure with crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero closure artifacts but paraphrase loops in "stoically sensitive" repetitions (-0.4); "fragile beauty encased in chill" exemplifies textural specificity, though "charred hope" verges on abstract metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwritten ("serenely electric glow, calm as a sleeping storm"). Template cadence in tuning sequence ("First... Next... Discarding another...") triggers -0.5 penalty. Final line ("whispering promises of fresh starts") avoids sentimentality through concrete wind imagery, but "shard of hush" borders on thematic label.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with concrete propulsion ("sinew thread, harvested from veins of forgotten beasts"), but paraphrase loops: "memories alter" refrain (3 identical phrases) and "realistically imaginary" overuse (4x) dull closure impact. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "profound quiet of achievement mingled with grief" avoids sentimentality with concrete specificity. Minor deduction: "somber glow" borders cliché in high-pressure beat, slightly dulling immediacy without pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.8)
    Overwritten high-pressure beats ("fog swirled like forgotten breaths, amplifying the reeling hush") create mixed metaphors that blur causality; template cadence ("Elara adjusted... Elara was...") dulls momentum in the discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "rustled terminals," "steam-filled antechamber" show don’t tell. Only minor density dip in steam chamber ("whispering forgotten names") slightly blurs immediacy—no closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose avoids loops but "ephemeral patterns" repeats adjacent lines, risking synonym churn. Final line’s "ready to face the world anew" skirts cliché yet gains freshness via shard warmth. High density overall, though "catastrophic end" slightly flattens Elara’s stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero scaffold loops and high density, but borderline purple prose in "sun bleeding red over bone towers" slightly dulls momentum. Final line’s "translating touch into timeless sound" risks abstraction yet redeems itself through concrete prior imagery. No closure-impacting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops with high density ("gravitationally playful tug" compresses physics/emotion), but "frostbitten yet hopeful" is stock phrasing in high-pressure beat, dulling transformation cost.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Resonantly soft" appears 3x with near-synonym variation ("velvet thunder," "blooming into symphony"), triggering −0.3 loop penalty; otherwise clean propulsion and no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor paraphrase loops ("fostered connections"/"fostering hope") and "fragile yet real" sentimentality prevent 9+, but high density prevails. "Miniaturized lightning" slightly strains metaphor without muddying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold in closure, but adjacent synonym loops ("misting hush"/"soft veil of quiet") and elevated diction ("improbably thriving") in mid-beats dilute momentum; final line's propulsion compensates for minor density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    Paraphrase loop in climax ("folded the scarf anew... solitude now laced with connection") and "tactile remembrances" abstraction dull closure beat; otherwise strong density, but artifacts in final third cap high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    Near-claustrophobic figurative density in climax ("rays into vibrant strokes," "symbols shimmering") risks muddle but serves Accumulative lens. Minor synonym churn in "vitalizing the dream frame by frame" slightly dulls propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    Zero paraphrase loops; "ribbon unraveling slightly in trembling fingers" shows over tells. Figurative language sparse in high-pressure beats (disorientation sequence), but "cosmic possibility" risks abstraction. Final line's "tears mingled with the hush" achieves textural precision.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero scaffold loops; "sediment swirled like forgotten dreams" integrates setting with interiority. Figurative language sparse but potent ("nostalgia hit like fresh breeze"). Final line’s "crisp nostalgia" avoids echo by charging motif with earned specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "triangles of betrayal, circles of potential return" demonstrates high density without muddle. Final line ("quiet work enduring in the forgotten library's eternal hush") recharges opening dust motes with earned weight. Near-synonym repetition of "reversible exile" in one paragraph costs 0.1. Propulsion flawless under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose excels in lyrical rhythm yet suffers paraphrase loops ("radiant hush" variations) and synonym churn ("mist-kissed vines"/"misty veil"); no closure-dulling artifacts, but the final third's repetitive cadence slightly diminishes propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    No loops or scaffold, but "lucid unrest" recurs 4× without evolution in peak beats, slightly muddling emotional specificity. Final line ("purpose fulfilled") risks tell-over-show yet avoids closure dulling.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.7)
    Minor synonym loops ("methodically curious... methodically set up") and "silence" repetition dilute density. No major artifacts, but climax's figurative muddle ("portal") dulls closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density falters with minor scaffold: "seldom-heard" repetition and "driftingly alert" synonym churn in thunder sequence. Final paragraph avoids artifacts, but "whispers of wind, seldom reaching mortal ears" duplicates "seldom-heard balladeer" with no added pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels revelation. "Brittle cover carefully" shows rather than tells, and final phrase "encrypted light" crystallizes concept without muddle. Figurative language serves pressure, as in "edges curled like forgotten secrets."

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density in cloud imagery avoids overwriting, yet "dusty starlight" repetition (3x) and "spooled wholeness" near-synonym churn in final beats dull closure's propulsion; no fatal artifacts but minor scaffold prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    "Heightened stillness" recurs twice within 3 lines (loop penalty); otherwise impeccable propulsion—final line ("sealing it as the stillness broke") achieves resonant closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion ("His heart raced; this could be the key") but "sociable isolation" appears twice with identical phrasing (loop), and "diligently curious" edges toward label-speak in peak beat without embodied contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor paraphrase loop in apprenticeship memory ("drifted like weathered wood ashore—nights spent...") slightly dulls momentum, but zero figurative muddle in peak beats; final line’s "eternal chill" achieves high density without scaffold, though one synonym cycle ("hauntingly bright"/"spectral flames") limits 9+ eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor paraphrase loops: "thorny struggles intertwined with flickers of optimism" then "brambled hope tangled with doubt." Strong verbs ("crunched," "pulsing") propel momentum, but "strangely trustworthy" label recurs without embodied proof—felt cost resides only in Elara's fade, not the family's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density occasionally blurs causality in ritual beat ("tracing cracks unlocked sequence" lacks concrete cause/effect). Figurative language ("sigh across the cosmos") risks abstraction but stays voice-coherent. No paraphrase loops, yet "nested patterns" repetition slightly dilutes momentum. Final line's resonance compensates for minor scaffold in middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    No loops or scaffold, but "ethereal flowers that wilted into thorns by dusk" risks redundant description; figurative language remains clear yet slightly dense in one high-pressure beat, narrowly avoiding overwriting penalties.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor rhythm hiccups ("wandered into the braided ravine where streams intertwined like divergent melodies seeking harmony") dilute propulsion; no closure-tainting artifacts but adjacent metaphor density risks overwriting in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor synonym loops ("fragments integrated, fragmenting no more") risk scaffold, but high density propels closure. "Mercury dreams" metaphor coherent; final line’s rhythmic control ("incised with light") achieves propulsion without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    High density but climax overloads metaphors ("waves of sorrow flooded him... complex broth needing refinement"), diluting immediacy; no loops, yet "sanded smooth"/"rough edges" repetition in final paragraph creates subtle scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    Strong propulsion but paraphrase loops weaken density: "empathetically decisive" repeated verbatim 4x with minimal variation. Mixed metaphor ("vibrations carried on the wind, like distant conversations in creaking steel") reduces clarity. Final paragraph's "vigorous in its tender rebirth" edges toward overwriting but avoids closure damage.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=4.3)
    Overwriting cripples climax: "shattered yet capable of chaotically precise insights" and "rocks shifting like neurons firing" create mixed metaphors that obscure cause/effect; three consecutive filter-verb stacks in memory sequence dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Template cadence ("her motivation burning... latent blaze simmering") and metaphor clash ("latent blaze ignite") in high-pressure beats. Final paragraph's "clandestinely luminous" repetition triggers paraphrase loop.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor paraphrase loops in "intensely quiet" descriptions slightly dilute momentum, but sentence variety and concrete verbs ("spiderwebbed," "quivered") propel closure. Figurative language remains purposeful without muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero figurative muddle in peak beats, but paraphrase loops ("silence of exile correlated to... silence of birdsong") deduct 0.2; strategic telling compresses backstory without scaffold, preserving propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.4)
    Template cadence weakens propulsion in "First came... Next, tuning higher..." sequence; "velvet-bound tome" after "frayed velvet" creates synonym churn, but zero closure artifacts preserve momentum in the final forgiveness beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong lyrical rhythm falters with minor paraphrase loops ("swirling patterns" repeated) and scaffold in transitions ("As days blurred..."), dulling momentum without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong propulsion until grotto: "crimson bubbles" fruit simile works, but echo descriptions ("translucent wisps") verge on purple prose. Template cadence in inversion sequence ("water droplets swirled... paths revealing...") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Scaffold loops weaken momentum ("Mara pursued... Mara's task... Mara navigated") and filter verbs cluster in pressure beat ("she paused... she recalibrated"). Near-closure image ("hazy precision held") avoids muddle but synonym churn in mid-section triggers -0.4 penalty.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.3)
    Near-loop in middle beats: "calm settling like fresh snow... stirring with subtle urgency" followed by "heart oscillated between repose and gentle thrill" slightly dulls propulsion. Otherwise vivid density with strategic telling; final line ("hush sculpted anew") delivers crystalline closure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "silence built layer upon layer... accumulating like snow" then "avalanchingly quiet amplified each revelation"; otherwise vivid propulsion with no closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor paraphrase loop ("turbulent patterns"/"whirlwind of light") in high-pressure beat; otherwise high density with clean propulsion through cosmic decay imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor synonym churn ("fading from memory to myth" repetition) and elevated diction ("jittery relic courier") slightly disrupt momentum. High density compensates, but "fading auroras" description risks static repetition in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless density: "mist clung to crystalline branches like forgotten secrets" does triple duty. Minor deduction for "shifted hush" repetition (4x)—not scaffold but edges toward loop, slightly dulling closure's final impact despite strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.1)
    Minor scaffold in "stoically sparkling" repetition (3x) slightly dulls closure beat; otherwise high density ("jagged fragments—not whole pieces, but jigsaw puzzle edges") avoids purple prose while advancing atmosphere and ritual mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with purposeful rhythm shifts, but "defiant" repetition creates subtle scaffold. Final image remains sharp despite minor overwriting in ritual description.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.8)
    Figurative language density acceptable early but muddles climax ("shadows elongated, air thickened with scent of blooming nightflowers"); paraphrase loop in "cyclically spontaneous" repetitions dulls momentum in third act.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with strategic figurative language, though "luminescent ache" refrain risks slight overuse in peak beats without full pattern payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Line-level craft strong but "shadowed elation" (3x) creates paraphrase loop. "Coiling like ink in water" overwrites pivotal shadow-stirring moment. Final line’s "unseen but inevitable" slightly muddles closure’s physicality.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=5.8)
    Overwritten density: "quiet explosion of insight that rippled through the air" (mixed metaphor) and repetitive "iridescent caution" phrasing dull immediacy; final paragraph’s "ready to dye fabrics" uses generic verbs obscuring closure’s emotional charge.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "moonlight pooled like spilled mercury" exemplifies high-density imagery. Final line ("miracles unfolded... listening") recharges motif without sentimentality. Figurative language sparse but potent in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    Severe overwriting in climax ("golden strands born of reflected sunrises looped through swaddled fruits") creates figurative muddle; synonym loops ("ethereal beings drifting apart like unraveling yarn") reduce propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsion until "enlarged tranquility" repetition creates synonym loop in closure beat (paragraphs 14, 15, 17). Near-duplicate phrasing ("tranquility enlarging, expanding") risks scaffold, though final image remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero loops; "vines strangled marble statues" exemplifies textural density. Minor synonym churn on "tenuous absolution" (4 near-identical uses) triggers -0.3 scaffold penalty in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with purposeful imagery ("swirling helix of gold and azure"), but repetitive "gently meticulous" and "quartz hush" risk synonym churn; final beat remains artifact-free with clear propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.5)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "shattering like a distant gunshot" compresses tension without muddle. Final line avoids sentimentality with concrete charge: "watch fob heavy with the echo of justice" propels closure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops and high density ("cosmic dust mixed with earthly honey"), but minor overwriting in high-pressure beats ("bioluminescent polls lighting up like ancient fireworks") slightly dulls immediacy near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor paraphrase loop in "reclaimed honesty" echoes; "tears welled" borders on label-only feeling. Otherwise high density—bioluminescent vines both set scene and illuminate map assembly without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "forged a framework of slender, wind-kissed metals" compresses action without scaffold. Minor abstraction ("motivation burned quietly") avoids penalty; final line "wonder's color shone undimmed" crystallizes density with zero loops in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    High density with minimal scaffold; "memories assaulted her in fragments" is minor paraphrase loop. Figurative language ("corral wildfire into a lantern") avoids muddle. Final line’s poetic compression ("whole in her pieced-together soul") elevates closure without obscuring cause/effect.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold: "vibrant courtyard" repeated twice, "sandstorm calm" overused in finale. Clean syntax but "amber and rose" hues border cliché. No fatal loops; propulsion maintained through concrete actions (fingers tracing bark). Final line achieves textural specificity with "talisman of connection."

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density and vivid imagery, but adjacent-line synonym churn ("calm defiance" x4, "mysterious familiarity" echoes) dulls immediacy in closure beats without strategic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor overwriting in phrases like "nocturnal haven" risks dilution, yet rhythmic control prevails—final line "secrets forever smoothed into hush" delivers crystalline propulsion without scaffold or loop artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.6)
    High density with zero loops, but "patiently nimble" repetition borders on scaffold in study scenes; no closure impact. Final line’s "bond sealed forever" slightly overwrites the earned ambiguity of their transformed dynamic.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong rhythmic control but suffers paraphrase loops ("ghostly resolve" ×3, "tragically radiant" ×2) and scaffold sentences; "skepticism warring with charm" demonstrates synonym churn that dulls immediacy in pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with resonant imagery, but "calibrated precision" echoes "calibrated treason" creating subtle synonym churn in closure beat. No fatal artifacts, yet propulsion softens slightly there.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong textural specificity ("frozen driftwood pedestal," "thawed wonder") but adjacent paraphrase loop: "whispered secrets of forgotten voyages" followed by "spectral voices that clung like frost" triggers -0.2. Final image avoids figurative muddle yet "borrowed starlight brighter" slightly overwrites.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops/scaffold; high density ("whorls and eddies, mirroring the nets") with clear propulsion. Minor figurative muddle in "sparkling yet heavy with melancholy" slightly blurs pressure, but closure image ("bamboo tea whisk tucked away") remains crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Shadow of doubt crept in" is therapy-speak label violating embodied emotion. Minor paraphrase loop: "peeling back layers...chained to false hopes" echoes "excavate truth" without added pressure. Final image strong but "weight of truth" slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion with high information density, but minor figurative muddle ("sapphire wound," "whimsical fury") in high-pressure beats slightly dulls the storm's visceral impact.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong textural specificity (driftwood pallet, chipped paint) but paraphrase loops ("sweeten the bitterness... sweeten it") and elevated diction ("lonesome splendor") in high-pressure beats dull immediacy. Figurative language avoids muddle yet accumulates scaffold near closure.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.1)
    Overwritten phrases ("fleshly pull of survival intertwining with ethereal call") create therapy-speak label in high-pressure beat. Paraphrase loop in motivation description dulls immediacy despite otherwise vivid propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero scaffold/loops with high density: "magnetic viaduct, a crumbling arch of iron-laced stone spanning a ravine" compresses worldbuilding and action prep. Final beat ("signals pulsed out, invisible waves") maintains clarity. "Restrained wildness" repetition (3x) near-synonym churn in peak beats costs 0.1 despite motif service.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor scaffold in "entangled memories" repetition and "quantum-like links" jargon; strong propulsion otherwise, but figurative muddle ("shatter like breaking chains") slightly dulls closure's precision in final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.7)
    High density falters with "vibrant hush" loops (3x) and template cadence in "aptly deliberate" repetitions, but propulsion remains clean. Final line’s "clockwork heart beating steadily onward" avoids figurative muddle, charging closure with crystalline rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minor loops: "evolved" (5x), "irreverent" (4x) in climax. "Steadily curious" is label-repetition. Final beat has slight overwriting ("defiant laugh... pealed a frequency") but propulsion holds. No closure-dulling artifacts—figurative language serves pressure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold: "sensed absence" evolves meaningfully from hollow quiet to new burden. Final line recharges opening ("digital mausoleum" → "weight of secrets") with crystalline propulsion. Figurative language sparse yet potent ("profiles lingered like ghosts") in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffolding; "empathy for their plights—starvation, isolation, loss—burned within her" contains diagnostic label-speak but avoids full penalty via embodied context. No template cadence; final line "floe below began to still" avoids sentimentality through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "windborne sigh, like breath over lace" exemplifies high-density propulsion. Figurative language ("patience woven thin") serves character without muddling the storm climax's visceral immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; high density with propulsion in "fingers tracing the singed words." "Liquid gold" risks purple prose but is redeemed by context. Final line’s "enriched his solitary watch" avoids figurative muddle while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.1)
    High density with minimal scaffold, though "starlit robes igniting faint sparks" overwrites early beat. Final paragraph's "conjured clearings fading" delivers propulsion, but template cadence ("Elar stepped... Elar knelt...") appears mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.8)
    Severe filter-verb stacks ("Elara moved," "she carried," "she opened") cluster in high-pressure beats, triggering -0.7 penalty. Template cadence ("As vines climbed...") repeats 4x with identical structure, dulling closure image. Purple prose ("emerald ribbons") muddles causality in peak moments despite lyrical strengths.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero scaffold loops; high density with "dust-moted air like hesitant whispers" risking slight metaphor muddle; "sonically reflective" repetition lacks variation but closure image ("post-dictionary dawn") achieves crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-flawless propulsion with varied syntax ("He believed that somewhere..."), but "echoes" repetition (8x) borders on scaffold in mid-beats; density remains high without muddling closure's organic hum imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.7)
    Near-loop in "luminous ache" → "radiant peace" in final beats; "frantic whirl/ceaseless motion" slight redundancy. Otherwise impeccable propulsion—no figurative muddle, with sentence rhythms mirroring tremor intensification and leaf-fall grace.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Decisively kind" label recurs as stock phrase in peak beats (e.g., "decisively kind preparation"), triggering -0.4 loop penalty that dulls immediacy. Otherwise strong propulsion with vivid textural specificity, though mixed metaphor ("hope had a scent... like rain on parched earth") slightly muddles sensory coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; sentences vary rhythm ("Gears whirred to life" vs flowing vision prose). High density: "luminous paths in the air" implies light/magic. Final line recharges opening motif without figurative muddle; read-aloud propulsion flawless in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density with concrete propulsion ("pushed through concealed archway"), but "nostalgic visions... innovated" creates mixed metaphor; minor scaffold in "method her aunt... had taught her" avoids closure impact, staying within Q7 8.0+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.9)
    "Memories resurfaced" verbatim repetition creates paraphrase loop in closure beat; final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally despite otherwise strong textural specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold in peak beats; "protected vulnerability" creates minor synonym churn but doesn't obscure closure; high density maintained through concrete verbs like "graft" and "proffer."

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.6)
    High density falters with synonym churn ("hush settled"/"quiet promise") and template cadence in hope sequences (repetitive "Elias pressed... willed... emerged"). Figurative language ("vines of possibility snarled") enriches but final paragraph's lyrical redundancy dulls closure propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density with "vines stirred, tendrils unfurling like sleepy children" advancing atmosphere and plot simultaneously, though one near-cliché ("curling like a question mark") slightly dulls peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is lush but occasionally overwrought ("frost-cloaked apple trees twisted like forgotten promises"); minor synonym loops ("moving stillness"/"unyielding poise") in high-pressure beats risk diluting momentum without pattern payoff, though final image’s "veins of light" delivers crystalline clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose achieves high density ("veins of white stone twisted like frozen rivers") with zero scaffold, yet near-looping in "peripherally" repetitions and "wounded season" overwriting muddles peak-beat clarity. Final line’s resonance avoids closure artifacts, but tension dips in reflective sections.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "fractal shadows" description, but zero loops in closure beat. High density with "lime-hardened weight" crystallizing abstract stakes; no figurative muddle at climax.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; "jeweled skylight like tears frozen in descent" risks purple prose but pays off in closure's "preserved moments." Near-repetition of "here and gone" in final paragraph slightly dulls momentum despite thematic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    Minor overwriting in "waters churned endlessly in defiance of gravity" but zero loops; "regret bloomed in her chest" avoids abstraction through visceral charge in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold loops and vivid propulsion ("water began to course through long-dormant pipes"), yet "stoic wonder" repetition (3x) creates subtle cadence monotony; "fractured dreams" borders on thematic echo but avoids full penalty through contextual integration with the sextant.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops in closure beat with high density, but "excruciatingly gentle" appears three times—repetitive phrasing near ending triggers -0.3 penalty despite vivid textural specificity elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters with "thoughtfully clear" repetition and static "serene upheaval" motif; minor paraphrase loop in "calm canal hid undercurrents of change / serene upheaval of dusk" slightly dulls closure’s conceptual charge.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Near-zero scaffold; "salt-crusted and frayed" exemplifies textural specificity. One paraphrase loop ("frozen electricity" implied twice), but propulsion remains crystalline. Final image avoids figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops/scaffold; density serves propulsion ("golden flecks seeming to unravel"). Final line crystallizes closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor scaffold in "gracefully alert" repetitions and borderline label-speak ("unyielding compassion") dull immediacy in two beats; no closure artifacts but density slightly overloads in ritual description.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; peak beats ("a soft pop echoing like a muffled shout of triumph") balance specificity and propulsion. Figurative language ("gurgles" washing away "hush") charges closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops; high density with "algorithms that could model endless loops" doing triple duty. "Quiet sighs" repetition slightly risks synonym churn but earns resonance through final reprise. No figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Thundering calm" repetition (4x) risks scaffold loop but earns resonance through evolving context; near-miss with "serene frenzy" metaphor yet closure lines ("woven, poetic storm") achieve crystalline propulsion without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("latent power" conveys spiritual weight economically). Figurative language serves pressure ("metronome of fate"), with final beat avoiding overwriting: "balance restored in tiny, diligent steps" lands cleanly without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.0)
    Figurative overload in opening ("cobalt silo loomed like a forgotten sentinel," "laughter a soft ripple") risks density penalty; clean closure image saves momentum but adjacent synonym loops ("tenderly organized," "lovingly remembered") trigger minor scaffold deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    High density with minimal scaffold, but paraphrase loop ("transforming the immutable into a canvas for progress"/"mapping not just present but potential futures") dulls propulsion in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong propulsion marred by repetitive scaffolding ("thistled calm" x4, "secretly luminous" x3) and template cadence in broadcast descriptions, dulling high-pressure beats without harming closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.3)
    Near-zero scaffold; "rhythmic creak fading like a dying heartbeat" exemplifies textural density. Minor register drift in "ground from the bones of ancient illusions" risks purple prose but earns payoff through thematic weight—no muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line craft excels with textural specificity ("silt of centuries compressed into mere decades"), but minor scaffold appears: "his mind wrestling with doubts as his hands clawed deeper" tells rather than shows internal conflict. No loops in closure beat; final line recharges motif.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.8)
    "Traveled stillness" repeats four times, crossing into synonym churn that dulls the final hum’s impact. Otherwise flawless propulsion—phrases like "peeling away the cacophony" do triple duty—but the loop in closure prevents 9.0 despite high density elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level propulsion falters in "nutrient-rich broths infused with echoes of joy" (overwritten); minor synonym loops ("deliberate," "informed by intuition") dilute momentum near climax.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "bio-luminescent drones, their wings sparking" compresses tech/emotion without muddle. Final semicolon creates crystalline cadence shift that recharges the nectar motif.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor overwriting in opening ("spring unfurled like a secret whispered among the willows") slightly dulls momentum, but final beats achieve zero scaffold with crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops but "threaded like needle through fabric" after "threading" creates minor scaffold; "foxglove hues spreading like ink" slightly muddles with "pulsating light." Final line's rhythmic cadence ("certainties threaded with subtle, life-giving doubt") redeems momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.2)
    Minor paraphrase loops around "balancedly daring" and math terminology; otherwise high density with clean propulsion, though "fading ink" detail slightly scaffolds closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.4)
    Minor scaffold in brush description ("bristles ended in a sliver of meteorite"). High density but slight synonym churn ("methodically hopeful" repetition). No artifacts in closure beat; propulsion maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "perfumed fear knotting her throat" shows embodied tension; only marginal risk in "rosewater yielding to hope" saved by active verb avoiding sentimentality in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; high density ("barnacle-crusted rocks," "subdued, ethereal shimmer"). Figurative language ("weary breath") serves character voice without muddle. Final image avoids purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters in peak beats: "repulsive allure" repeats verbatim (loop -0.3), and "lingering luminance" lacks evolution. Otherwise vivid propulsion ("distorting his reflection into grotesque, alluring shapes") with no closure-dulling artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.3)
    Lyrical density elevates tension with zero scaffold, though "euphony" repetition approaches loop in climax without dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "sun-bleached sprawl"/"sunwashed dread" repetition slightly dulls momentum; otherwise high-propulsion prose with concrete verbs ("splintering the shell outward in a web of fractures").

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.9)
    Minor template cadence in opening ("Elias was... Elias had learned... Elias arrived") triggers -0.4 loop penalty. Final paragraph's "resolute, his mission... bridge between buried past" risks thematic echo but avoids outright moralizing, sparing harsher deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong propulsion but scaffolded emotional labeling ("stoically sensitive, bearing weight") in paragraph 2; final "fire of unearthed dreams" slightly overwrought for peak intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; 'squid essence ink bloomed dark and true' does triple duty (sensory, thematic, plot). Final line recharges opening motif with precision. Peak-beat prose ('pressed the stamp... thud echoing') maintains clarity under pressure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=9.2)
    Near-flawless propulsion: "tears streamed down his face, glowing faintly" compresses emotion without scaffold. Minor synonym drift ("radiant memories"/"luminous torment") in mid-scene prevents 9.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.1)
    Line-level propulsion falters in the climax with repetitive "intangibly tangible" phrasing and slight overwriting ("pools weren't mere energy; they represented what could have been"), diluting momentum without pattern-teaching payoff in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is lush but "perpetual surprise" recurs 4× as repetitive scaffold, peaking in closure beat where emotional intensity should compress language. Filter-verb stacks ("her eyes widening," "face lighting up") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters in closure beat: "sieved hush followed him, a calmed silence where regrets were filtered" contains scaffold. Strong verbs ("whittled," "knelt") propel momentum, but filter-stack in high-pressure moment prevents 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor synonym loops ("recycled his mistake into wisdom"/"recycled now into wisdom") and slight overwriting in reflection blocks. No closure-dulling artifacts; final line's "enduring hush" achieves textural specificity with zero scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion with zero scaffold; only a minor paraphrase loop ("gravitating toward healing, he embraced") prevents 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero scaffold in peak beats, but "delicately robust" repetition (3x) edges toward synonym churn without sufficient pattern-teaching in the first third; final line’s lyrical compression ("Alex found not just wonder, but a path") avoids overwriting while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose sings with textural specificity ("crystalline pod dangled"), but "cosmic intimacy" repeats mechanically (para 4, 7). Near-closure beat avoids loops, though "intoxicating and profound" borders on purple. Final line's recharged motif ("eternally blooming") escapes scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    High density falters in "exhaling a choking beauty that tightened her throat" (redundant modifiers); "thorns drawing beads of blood that tasted of salt and sorrow" risks purple prose. Final image remains clear despite minor scaffold in reflection beats.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion but minor overwriting in descriptive clusters ("faint shimmer of long-dried tears... crystalline traces that caught the dim light") slightly dilutes momentum. Zero loops, though density approaches purple prose in archive room setup.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong propulsion until final paragraph where "vibrant hush" repetition crosses into synonym churn; minor density issues in pressure beats (e.g., "vibrant yet subdued" redundancy) prevent 8.2+.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with propulsion ("she smoothly concealed... letting sundial revert"), but slight overwriting in "half-painted face adorned with incomplete arcs of gold and shadow" creates minor scaffold in high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.3)
    Minor overwriting in high-pressure beats: "glimpses of futures haunting her like shadows in borrowed dawn" risks figurative density, but final image ("stand still on the bluff") delivers clarity and propulsion without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.8)
    Overwriting risk in "silver fury" lightning descriptions; minor synonym churn ("turbulent awe"/"storm-kissed wonder") dilutes momentum in high-pressure beats, though final image remains vividly charged.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong propulsion but "dignified chaos" repetition creates subtle scaffold; mixed metaphor "storm of thoughts restrained by scholarly poise" slightly muddles peak tension.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-zero scaffold; "luminous fractures" repetition (3x) skirts synonym churn but earns density through motif reweighting. Final beat clean ("ready to wander anew"), though "fractured luminescence" edges toward purple prose without dulling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold—every sentence advances multiple elements (e.g., "sun dipped low" sets time, pressure, and mood). Figurative language sparse yet potent ("tides swelled like a stormy sea"); final line avoids cliché with crystalline propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "luminous pollen forming shapes" exemplifies high-density imagery. Minor register drift in "conceptual cost" (academic phrasing) barely intrudes but doesn't obscure closure. Final line’s poetic compression sustains propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; "rhythmically placid" cadence mirrors emotional state. Minor density issue: "blue-tinged sorrow that colored his days like the sea meeting the sky" slightly overwrought for high-pressure beat, risking clarity near midpoint.
