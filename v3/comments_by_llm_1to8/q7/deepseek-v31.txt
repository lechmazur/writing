  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "dust from a butterfly wing, and it held the secrets of a different kind of gravity" bridges scientific and emotional registers. Minor scaffold in "She saw...She began to see" but propulsion remains strong through varied syntax and precise technical language.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in non-pressure moments ("drifting resonance," "hollow echo") and occasional abstract phrasing ("scorched testament of her former existence"). The final paragraph's metaphorical cluster about light/glass/justice, while thematically apt, slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good information density, but several issues: repetitive sentence openings with "She" (5 consecutive), some abstract phrasing ("typhoon of grief"), and ornate diction that occasionally obscures ("unshaken marvels"). The final paragraph achieves strong propulsion. Template cadence in the middle experimental sequence triggers deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Deductions for abstract phrases ("chased stillness," "desperate need"), some elevated diction that doesn't match POV ("aqueous gloom"), and mild redundancy in describing the library's paradoxical nature.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some elevated diction ("encroaching silence," "practiced, soundless efficiency") creates mild register drift. Information density strong in discovery scene. Template cadence appears briefly ("He watched... He understood...") but doesn't pervade.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("pilgrim of sparks seeking a different kind of illumination"). Minor template cadence in "She understood now... She knew now..." construction. Information density high but occasionally tips toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("The maze was a temporal equation") but suffers from abstract phrasing that dulls immediacy ("to feel the grain of years as one might feel the grain of wood"). Some overwriting appears ("quaking reverie," "haunting echo") without clear payoff. Information density is moderate; several sentences restate rather than advance ("The memory was a loop, a haunting echo she could neither escape nor fully recall").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum. The "staggering grace" metaphor works well. Deductions for redundancy ("silent, patiently strategic silence"), some abstract phrasing ("hollowed-out temple of fleeting joy"), and occasional overwriting in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and some strong images. However, multiple instances of abstract phrasing ("battered marvel" appears twice, "sorrowful, weathered peace"), some purple prose ("ghostly ash," "phantom frequency"), and occasional redundancy ("fractured glass" could just be "shattered"). The density of figurative language in non-peak moments creates mild overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("singular specialty," "vaulted archways," "breathtaking substance"). The phrase "illuminated moments" appears twice in close proximity. Strong sentence variety and rhythm support the heist pacing, particularly in the escape sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence lengths and the drip-drip-drip rhythm. Some template phrasing appears ("thick with ghosts," "vast, cavernous space") and abstract descriptors ("weighty lightness," "thoughtfully attuned"). The unexplained Chinese character "赋予" disrupts clarity without purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("ghost in another man's action sequences") but suffers from abstract conceptual phrasing ("vulnerability is power, not the weakness") and some overwrought metaphors. The Chinese character insertion breaks consistency. Information density is generally high, though some philosophical assertions could be grounded in more concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in "flaking gold leaf booklet, its pages thin as insect wings." However, abstract loops appear: "mapping what came after, the great unknown that the night merely hinted at" restates without advancing, and "silence was its topography" tells what was just shown through the mapping metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "conducting an experiment in reality." Some density issues with figurative language clustering in the violin sequence. Minor template cadence in "In one loop... In another" but serves the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and effective rhythm modulation between contemplative and active beats. Information density is generally high, though some passages contain mild redundancy ("quiet night registrar"/"valued the solitude"). The metaphorical language occasionally strains ("alien artifact," "ghosts of conversations") but doesn't obscure meaning at crucial beats.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm ("Her back was a question mark"). Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("blooming withering" appears twice) and occasional elevated diction ("inexorable death") that slightly strains the gardener's register, though these support the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation ("Wait," he breathed) and purposeful repetition of "only" to narrow focus. Some redundancy in "silent hours"/"nocturnal stillness" and slight overwriting in "ancient and knowing" eyes, but information density remains high with most sentences advancing multiple layers (atmosphere, stakes, character state).

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("her breath a pale cloud in the lantern-lit gloom"), but several redundancies weaken momentum: "profound and unsettling beauty" (pick one), "mighty, musical exhalation" (adjective stack). Template phrasing appears in "Her heart hammered against her ribs." The "symphonious shudder" attempts cleverness but muddles clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting in figurative language ("vast, snow-whipped window," "convenient physiological coup") and occasional register elevation. The "smudge" moment effectively uses physical action to mirror internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("spectral overtime," "data stream of anguish"). Minor issues: "religiously skeptical to her core" reads as tell-not-show; some filter verb clustering ("she saw," "she understood"). The "drowsy alertness" paradox works but appears only once.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum, but some figurative density clusters ("crumbling peace, a tranquility forever on the verge of collapse") and repetitive constructions ("She did not...She needed to...She invited...She focused...She was not"). The filter-verb stack in the healing sequence ("She focused on...drawing it...pushing it") dulls immediacy at a crucial moment.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor issues: "slumbering oaks" and "dreaming roots" feel slightly overwrought; "fragile, real smile" could be sharper. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("oak desk carved from a pew," "blistered leather covers"). Some redundancy appears ("profound grief" after showing grief, "frantic purpose" after showing franticness) and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and strong imagery. Some overwrought moments ("the familiar enigma of his own existence settling around him once more") and occasional redundancy ("new, uncertain, and beautiful"). The musical metaphors occasionally strain but mostly land effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum through the confrontation sequence. Strong verb choices ("plumb," "festering," "slithered"). However, some overwriting appears ("susurrus of broken logic," "congealed night") and occasional redundancy ("perfect, recursive logic" could be tighter).

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the memory-mapping sequence. Some elevated diction borders on purple ("vertiginous chamber," "fossilized labyrinth") but serves the lyrical mode. Minor template cadence in "She conducted...She began to map" sequence. Clear propulsion through varied sentence lengths matching emotional rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.8)
    While the prose achieves moments of striking imagery, it suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff ("breathless pause," "fading echoes," "liquid mercury"). The final paragraph contains multiple abstract constructions that dilute the closure's impact, and phrases like "darkening brightness" and "brilliant path and the hollow man" pile paradoxes without advancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in describing vibrations. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("managed to enthrall," "utterly silent yet thunderous") creates minor register drift. Occasional redundancy in emotional description ("profound attention" followed by "witnessing a conversation") but no loops touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose generally clean with good momentum, though several phrases edge toward overwriting ("meticulous storm recorder," "credibly curious nature," "horrifying truth"). Information density is solid—most sentences advance multiple story elements. The final image effectively recharges earlier motifs without loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some phrases edge toward purple ("labyrinth of his own mind," "grasping fingers"). The final paragraph contains slight redundancy with both "never truly extinct" and similar preservation concepts. Generally clean execution with varied sentence structure supporting rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks, particularly in the choice sequence. Some abstract phrasing ("potential chaos he could not measure," "passionate subtlety radiated") and filter constructions ("He felt them trace") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially "salt-tolerant fruits grew wild and strange, their twisted branches pressing against the murky panes." Minor template cadence in "She placed...She did not play...She drew" sequence and slight overwriting in "chronic hush" repetition prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax and purposeful momentum, particularly strong in the grotto sequence's sensory cascade. Some conceptual redundancy around "half truths" and "perfect replica" concepts. Template cadence appears briefly ("She placed...She settled...She closed") but doesn't pervade or touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and clear momentum. Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. Several instances of overwriting ("tapestry of celestial light," "whimsically attentive nature") and some redundancy in describing Maeve's work. The closing image of "a new, hopeful symphony" feels forced.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Several instances of repetitive phrasing ("glimmering obsidian arbor" appears unchanged, "luminescent ache" recycled) and some abstract constructions ("monument to silence," "world beyond the murmur") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose flows smoothly with varied sentence structures and strong imagery. However, several instances of telling over showing ("She was consumed by a singular motivation," "Desperate, she pressed") and some purple prose tendencies ("manifestation of pure chronology") prevent higher scoring. The final line "ready to uncage infinity" lands effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several overwriting issues: "moon-kissed hills," "gossamer formulae," elevated diction in peak moments. Some paraphrase loops ("The loss was still ambiguous, the absence still present"). Information density is uneven - ornamental description competes with meaningful detail. The prose serves the accumulative mode but lacks consistent propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity and varied rhythm. Some redundancy in the setup ("forgotten conduits and insulation dust, of narrow passages") and occasional abstraction ("her action would be seen") detract from otherwise solid line-level craft. The "sapphire hush" bookending works effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Notable issues: template cadence in observation sequences ("He observed... He saw... He watched"), some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete, and occasional overwriting ("perpetually on the cusp of becoming"). The scaffolding phrases limit momentum in key transformation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Some overwriting appears ("vaporous traces," "haggard awe" used twice) but doesn't obscure clarity. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in "He looked... He met... He had nothing."

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves clarity with moments of beauty - "a place of bright darkness, where joy and dread could share the same note." Some figurative excess appears ("velvety blackness," "internal moonlight"). The shadow mechanics paragraph contains slight opacity but overall momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean with varied sentence structures and purposeful imagery. Information density is adequate with most lines advancing story or atmosphere. However, some phrases feel overwrought ("scrubbed clean," "sharp as a splinter") and there's occasional redundancy in explaining Elara's scholarly nature. The "reactively visionary" construct appears twice with similar phrasing, creating mild repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is moderate - most sentences advance the story. Minor issues with some elevated diction ("opaque wall," "basalt pedestal") and occasional redundancy ("trembling certainty" appears twice). The "somehow knew" construction weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose is clean and propulsive with strong rhythm variation and information density. Each sentence advances story or atmosphere. Minor figurative density in peak moments ("swirled like ink in water") serves the accumulative mode. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong propulsion and varied syntax, particularly in action sequences ("The wall didn't break; it unraveled"). Information density high throughout. Deductions for minor redundancies ("ancient apathy"/"long buried under layers of ennui") and some abstract phrasing in spatial descriptions that slightly dulls clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple story functions. Some overwriting in metaphorical language ("liquefied her anger," "ocean of unspoken sacrifice") and occasional abstract phrasing ("deathly vitality that hummed"). The repeated "deathly vitality" bookend feels forced rather than organic. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("gilded-leaf," "blooming labyrinth," "palimpsest of invented histories"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("incandescent restraint," "arboreal maze") but serves the mystical tone. Information density high—most sentences advance both external action and interior state.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The tides shaped his days" establishes both schedule and metaphor. Some elevated diction ("irrevocably crossed out," "singular attribute") occasionally drifts from the industrial setting but serves the conceptual frame. No loops or scaffolding; prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several instances of elevated diction ("profound satisfaction," "teased the edges of human understanding") and some redundancy ("gloomy cheerfulness" explained as "gloomy cheerfulness born of"). The final paragraph maintains strong propulsion. Information density is moderate with most sentences doing single duty.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves solid momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor template cadence in "She had seen... They were remembering..." sequence and slight overwriting in final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong information density. "The click was absorbed by the total vacuum" exemplifies economy. Some figurative density in emotional beats ("funeral for a world," "velvet sky") without becoming purple. Minor template moments ("She thought of," "She was") but momentum maintains.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts during the repair sequence. However, some overwriting appears ("grand but neglected Victorian water feature," "crystalline dart against the grey sky") and occasional template constructions ("She began," "She carefully carried") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "The ice was clear black there, a window into the deep, freeze-dried water." Some repetitive constructions ("She had found it. But the discovery brought no triumph") and occasional overwriting ("profound and worrying tranquility") create minor drag. The paraphrase loop "She had found where the rivers began, and in doing so, had found the end of the world" restates rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm control with varied sentence lengths creating textural momentum, particularly in the pattern-walking sequence. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("struck the ebony tuning fork against her leather-wrapped palm"). Minor issues include occasional abstract phrasing ("shared balance," "rift between this place and the world") and some filter constructions ("Elara paused," "She found") that slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears: "lonesome splendor," "velvety fabric woven from centuries." Information density high in descriptive passages. Minor template cadence in "He saw... He gripped... He unstoppered" sequence. The final image efficiently reweights prior material.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and atmospheric rhythm. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("spectral guardian... swirling concentration of every desperate plea") and abstract phrasing ("sustained impossibilities," "thread the labyrinth"). Information density is good but could be tighter in places.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for filter-verb clusters ("She felt the presence," "Elara understood," "She smiled") and slight overwriting in metaphorical density during the greenhouse description.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose flows with intentional rhythm—"She awoke walking, her bare feet finding a familiar groove in stone"—though occasional overwriting appears ("hauntingly optimistic," "luminous, perfectly still pool"). The mythic tone occasionally substitutes elevated diction for concrete detail, particularly in emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones"). Information density is good with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("comfortable, foreign practicality," "quietly desperate motivation") and occasional overwriting ("spectacular, haunting fusion") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"chrome pillars and glowing game cabinets humming with dormant energy" establishes setting, time, and atmosphere simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("peculiar art," "arcane strokes") occasionally drifts from character register. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for scattered filter verbs, some synonym repetition ("silence/silent/quiet"), and occasional overwriting in figurative language ("the scent of decay and cold stone").

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but template cadence appears in "She walked...She held...She was" sequences. The phrase "fierce tenderness" repeats mechanically three times without evolution, and some metaphorical density in the labyrinth section approaches overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("consciousness receding from the sterile edges"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("lotus-hearted ache," "neural lightning," "chemical sea") without clear pattern-teaching. Minor template cadence in "She saw...She felt...She spoke." Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong imagery like "spectral fruit that shimmered with internal radiance." Information density is generally high though some phrases approach purple ("woolen blanket that had settled"). Minor redundancy in "silent performance" after establishing her boots were "silent on the cobbles."

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity. However, several instances of elevated diction ("perpetual, low symphony," "desperate curiosity") and some repetitive structures ("She saw...He had used...This was"). The phrase "beautiful questions" in the final paragraph verges on abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose is generally clean with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("brass gears whirring as they tallied the cost"). Minor template cadence in middle sections ("She was... It was... Their communications were"). The climactic sequence maintains strong propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("gargantuan," "infinitely sad," "profound quiet") and one instance of telling that could be shown ("Her purpose clarified with the sharpness of a lightning strike").

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and information density. Deduction for register drift into elevated diction ("sublime, aching beauty," "deserted marvel") and one instance of emotional labeling ("quiet dread settled"). The transformation sequence achieves excellent propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty - "symphony of truth waiting to be heard for the first time in a millennium." However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "restore trust after silence" followed immediately by "The silence was her own" creates redundancy. The "carefully reckless" oxymoron feels slightly forced rather than organic to voice.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum. Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well. Deductions for the unexplained Chinese character, slight overwriting in places ("perpetual gloom," "dormant volcano whose heart beat"), and one instance of telling emotion directly ("slyly heartfelt").

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density, particularly in the ritual sequences. Some filter-verb clustering ("She knew," "She had") in paragraph five slightly dulls immediacy. The "blooming, withering" motif integrates naturally rather than feeling forced. Final image lands with earned resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("silence that was less an absence of sound and more a blanket of stopped time"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("god's fist") and the unexplained Chinese character disrupts flow. Information density high but occasionally tips into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and sensory detail. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "rhythm" and some abstract constructions ("weight of the abyss pressed," "despair of her impossible task closing in"). The strongest passages integrate action and perception seamlessly, as in the polyp discovery sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines like "foam, like recollection, is tragically ephemeral" doing multiple jobs. Some mild repetition in emotional color descriptions ("sapphire blues of contentment") but the figurative language serves the accumulative pattern without overwhelming.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and rhythm that accelerates during the launch sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor overwriting appears ("precious sliver of time," "friendly universe") and some elevated diction occasionally strains, but momentum remains strong throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm that mirrors the tattoo process. Information density is generally high ("The ink was a tide locked under her skin, a permanent dance"). Minor deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("obsidian grace," "liquid silence") and slight redundancy in cosmic imagery that doesn't always advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and vivid sensory detail, particularly in "The mist swirled through the open door, catching the colored light." Some figurative density in the middle section ("noctilucent reckoning") and occasional elevated diction ("commune") create minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs ("His face, a landscape of shiny, taut skin and deep grooves"). Some overwriting appears in abstract moments ("translate pain into a universal language," "codex of survival") that could trust the imagery more. The "slow dance" motif effectively bookends the piece. Template phrasing in "He thought of... He thought of..." briefly disrupts rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with strong imagery, though some sentences strain under conceptual weight ("The convergence was exquisite, a silent chord struck deep within the structure of reality"). Information density is high but occasionally tips into abstraction. The final paragraph effectively braids action and meaning without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is solid. Deductions for abstract phrases like "weight of his legacy's burden" and "collective memory to guard against," plus some filter-verb reliance ("She understood then," "She felt"). The "terrible dream" metaphor at closure muddles slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose shows high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Her stillness was not an absence of feeling, but a deep, focused intensity"). Strong syntactic variety and momentum. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("achingly real") and one instance of tell over show ("drained but serene").

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("a miniature galaxy within it") but contains some abstraction loops around "redemption" and "price." The rhythm varies effectively between long cosmic observations and shorter action beats, though phrases like "operatively gentle" feel forced rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and purposeful imagery. However, several issues accumulate: the "chaos变量" error, occasional overwriting ("perfect ossified tear," "fractured grace"), and some template phrasing ("It was..." repetitions). Information density is good but these artifacts prevent entry to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some elevated diction approaches purple ("languid and deliberate dance that spoke of grace and unspoken depth"). Information density high in thread-untangling sequence. Minor abstract scaffolding ("quality of light," "impossible geometry") and one paraphrase loop ("silenced all dissent"/"the lullaby").

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though "half-lit epiphany began to dawn" mixes metaphors and some abstract passages ("highest ethical act wasn't to tell a story cleanly") reduce momentum. Information density is strong in action sequences. Minor scaffold in the philosophical middle section where adjacent sentences circle the same realization.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between stillness and disruption. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("a quiet so profound it felt respectful") and some template phrasing around "he had come to" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in high-pressure moments: "despair, an old acquaintance," "snowmelt ardor," "electric dance." Information density is strong—most sentences advance multiple story functions. Minor template cadence in the middle section's "She [verb]" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in technical-lyrical descriptions. Some minor repetition ("it had," "it was") creates slight template cadence. The crystalline/crystal repetition and abstract phrasing in the final paragraph ("lovely, and defiant acts") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("devotion"). Strong specificity in "terracotta magic square tile, its three-by-three grid." Some overwriting in "luminous abstraction peeling away" and slight redundancy in explaining the square's pattern. The Chinese character "标准" appears to be an error.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "where noise went to be unmade." Some abstract passages around cellular memory and minor redundancy ("silent air" after establishing silence). The ending image lands with clarity despite earlier opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, particularly in the breathing sequence. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for filter verb stack in paragraph 4 ("She knew...She remembered...She found it") and slight paraphrase loop with "breathe in, breathe out" repetition, though the latter creates intentional rhythmic effect. Strong sensory specificity throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("roots woven through saintly statues") but shows template cadence in places ("She took...She looked...She believed"). Information density is generally strong though some metaphorical reaches ("Some vows are deciduous") border on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("Trees of silver and gold bore fruits that were distant, swirling galaxies"). However, several instances of abstract phrasing ("brightened by a fierce, compulsive curiosity," "roaring symphony in her soul") and some filter-verb clustering in the vision sequence. The repeated "brightened disquiet" construction feels artificially elevated.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("geography of ink and vellum," "fractured light"). Template cadence in middle section ("He knew... He needed... He remembered..."). Information density is solid but uneven.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong moments like "fog was a spongy, gray wall" and maintains momentum through varied sentence structure. Minor redundancies appear ("memories alter" repeated twice) and some abstract phrasing ("essence of him"). Information density is generally high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves clarity and momentum through varied sentence structures and active verbs, though several metaphors strain ("spatial puncture," "topological truth"). Template phrasing appears in emotional beats ("sensation of vertigo threatening her composure") and some descriptions pad rather than advance ("murmur of the rain-drenched campus").

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though "hammered repose" and "metallic stillness" feel forced. Template cadence appears briefly ("She knew...She placed...She closed"). The transformation sequence maintains strong momentum but some abstract phrasing ("presence disrupting the ancient song") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the vision sequences. Information density is high—most sentences advance plot, atmosphere, or meaning. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("It was a faint light, a ghost of what once was, but it was lit. It was alive") and some scaffolding phrases ("Following a compulsion," "For a long moment"). The climactic paragraph contains slight redundancy between "faint light" and "ghost of what once was."

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high, particularly in the shadow-reading sequence.

    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is high, particularly in the vision sequence. Deductions for overwriting in places ("cathedral of the sea," "pinwheeled in a slow, majestic dance") and some figurative density during high-pressure beats without full payoff. Several instances of elevated diction strain the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong moments like "a slowly collapsing lung" and "the sound of the walls getting closer." Information density is generally high with sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm, particularly in the crystalline descriptions and the arc's resonance sequence. Information density is high - most sentences advance atmosphere, character, or plot simultaneously. Minor repetitive phrasing around "silence" and "quiet" creates slight redundancy, and "fluidly logical" appears twice as exact phrase.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative imagery like "stepping through a liquid galaxy" and varied sentence structures that support momentum. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing plot while building atmosphere. Some filter verb accumulation ("I found," "I stood," "I grasped") during action sequences dulls immediacy. The opening efficiently establishes world, character, and quest without excessive scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("loaded emptiness," "tender shadow keeper," "phantom limbs"). Some filter-verb clustering ("he saw," "seemed to") and occasional overwriting in metaphorical passages reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and purposeful rhythm variations. The description "fractaling air" and "coherent pressure" shows precision.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("cascade of light that flowed into Valerius's chest") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract phrasing. Some redundancy appears in emotional descriptions, and filter constructions like "He felt it more than saw it" diminish immediacy in key moments.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("pinpricks of light, magnifying small kindnesses"). Deductions for abstract clustering in opening paragraph, some filter constructions ("He felt a shift"), and elevated diction drift in closing ("sliver of redemption"). Information density could be higher in transitional passages.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears in figurative density ("liquid gold, swirling with a soft, internal luminescence").

Information density is high in most beats, particularly the puddle reflection sequence and phone booth discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm and varied sentence structure, particularly in the musical passages. Some overwriting appears in phrases like "quietly vivid glow" and "vested hush" that strain for effect. The "psychic equivalent of static" feels like unnecessary explanation. Information density is generally high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the hush where past meets prophecy") but suffers from occasional redundancy ("vast, silent tree" could lose an adjective).

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in "The water had touched the boy's boots last; it held his trace." Some figurative density in emotional beats ("kintsugi for a soul") and occasional abstract phrasing ("the integrity of her own spirit") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows moments of strong imagery but suffers from abstract phrasing ("lonely curation of grief," "archive of sorrows") and some register elevation that doesn't match urgency. The phrase "luminous ache" appears twice, creating unnecessary repetition. Clear propulsion in the final transformation sequence partially redeems earlier density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid sensory work ("ultraviolet shards," "chromatic dance"), though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("symphony of wrongness," "fragile thing"). The "braced will against the momentum of cruelty" and similar constructions edge toward elevated diction that slightly distances the visceral experience.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery but suffers from occasional overwriting ("eternal instant" appears multiple times, "fluid sea of the past"). Information density is generally good with lines doing multiple jobs. The phrase "elusively tangible" repeats verbatim, suggesting template adherence rather than organic variation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "dust motes, suddenly liberated from the shuddering light, drifted in the dimness like lazy confetti." Some repetitive sentence openings ("He saw," "Then he saw") create mild template cadence. The final paragraph's clean, declarative sentences effectively contrast the earlier descriptive density, creating purposeful rhythm shift at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in the whisper-release sequence. However, several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("mad purpose," "singular, impossible object") and there's mild redundancy in describing the perfect book's meaninglessness. The final paragraph's momentum is excellent, accelerating through shorter, more urgent sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though occasional overwriting appears ("deep, metallic grief"). The metaphor system around time/threads/weaving maintains coherence, and information density remains high, but some abstract phrases could be more concretely embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts, though some abstract phrasing ("pure potential that responded to truth") could be more concrete. The final paragraph's accumulating musical imagery ("tinkersong wonder of rising, crystalline notes") effectively builds momentum. Minor redundancy in explaining Silas's motives both through narration and dialogue.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and sensory density. Information density high in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("silent, respectful pause between seasons") with varied syntax and rhythm. Deductions for abstract metaphors that reduce clarity ("soul was a kaleidoscope of unspent color"), occasional overwriting in figurative density, and some elevated register drift ("umbral tenderness") that doesn't fully integrate with POV.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shadow a vast, silent kite") but occasional overwriting ("glint of panic in a young man's eyes as he hid this very book" unnecessarily doubles the panic). Some elevated diction in peak beats ("retrocognitively trapped," "phosphorescent seaweed") creates mild register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and good momentum through the discovery sequence. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("hollow whispers," "pervasive gloom") and some repetitive phrasing around memory/remembering that approaches template cadence in paragraph 3.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structure and effective momentum. Deductions for figurative density in places ("velvet disquiet," "blade of dread," "silent scream") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with evocative phrases like "the great ice had crept in silently" and varied sentence structures. However, some density excess appears in figurative language ("silent roar," "liquid suns") and occasional abstraction ("wild serenity," "furiously tranquil") that could be more concretely embodied. Information density is high but occasionally tips toward ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("fragile as a snowflake, crystallized" mixing metaphors). Minor template cadence in "She worked...Then, she waited" and filter-verb clustering around the climax ("seemed to pulse," "She understood") reduces immediacy without serving voice.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose occasionally overreaches with stacked abstractions ("serene and potent quiet that was not an absence of sound, but a fullness of understanding"). Some metaphors strain ("tapestry of infinite black"), and filter constructions accumulate in middle sections, though the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations and strong image density. Minor template cadence in ghost descriptions ("farmer ghost forever shading," "child-ghost tracing circles").

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm that mirrors Leo's measured existence. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing both external action and internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.2)
    Prose shows moments of beauty but suffers from overwriting and abstraction. Multiple instances of telling what has been shown ("She had taken the discordant notes...and composed from them a quiet hymn"), and the final paragraph contains excessive thematic summary that dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and strong information density, particularly in the wire-wrapping sequence. However, several abstract phrases ("brazen calm" repeated, "profound peace") and some filter constructions ("I felt," "I watched") diminish immediacy. The "tears cutting clean paths" image redeems the emotional beats.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with good momentum, though occasional overwriting appears ("luminous skeptic," "bronze quiet" used twice, "metallic, textured hush"). Information density is solid.

No loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddle; prose maintains clarity through peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwrought phrases ("wild hush," "ghost-voices of the dead world") edge toward purple. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "He [verb]" structures.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("profound quiet so complete it rang," "magnificent second"). The repetition of "echoed silence" and variations of "blessed pariah" serve the accumulative structure rather than creating loops.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Deductions for density issues: "fierce repose" appears twice verbatim; some overwriting in phrases like "woven hush, a silence so profound and intricate it felt spun from invisible thread." The filter-verb stack "He understood...He had to separate...He had to decode" dulls immediacy in a crucial realization beat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments ("forged hush," "canyon of endless echoes") but suffers from abstract passages that slow momentum. Several instances of telling over showing ("His motivation, burning like a hot coal"). Some repetitive phrasing around "truth" and "forgiveness" creates minor loops. The final paragraph contains too much conceptual summary rather than embodied resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally flows with good rhythm variation, though several instances of elevated diction feel forced ("cartography of damage," "stellar coordinate in its personal cosmos"). Some redundancy appears in the middle sections, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("She could not simply glue; she had to understand").

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty: "a sound like a frozen lake giving way."

The rhythm effectively varies between long atmospheric sentences and shorter action beats, though phrases like "monumental truth" edge toward abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose is generally clean with strong momentum, though "geography of loss" appears twice and some figurative language clusters densely ("bleeding atmosphere," "ghostly blue glow," "hydraulic heart").

The final image lands with appropriate weight despite minor redundancy in describing the station as both "tomb" and death-related imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but overwriting appears in peak beats ("symphony of shared suffering," "beautiful trap") creating figurative muddle. The untranslated Chinese characters and occasional purple prose ("fractured grace," "desperate arcs") reduce clarity, though momentum remains strong through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, literary prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression ("salt-stained suit, cold and still"). Information density high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("cacophonous creek," "visceral synthesis"). The piece maintains momentum but includes occasional redundancies like "desperate urge" and "unfulfilled potential" that could tighten.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is high in the grotto sequence. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("profound understanding surfaced," "immense, fragile beauty") and the therapy-speak "blindness to this vast, whispering network" that dulls immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm, though some abstract phrasing ("profound weight of a moment truly and fully lived") and filter verbs cluster in places. The spiral metaphor risks over-extension but maintains coherence. Information density is good but could be tighter in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, but several issues prevent higher scoring. Mixed metaphor of "quiet wildfire" that "burned in contained, frustrated silence" creates logical friction (-0.5). Template cadence in "She began...She would...Her system would" sequence (-0.4). Some overwriting in figurative density during high-pressure beats without clear payoff (-0.3).

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("clover melancholy of things both sweet and ended"). Some scaffolding in transitions ("So she went," "She solved them") and filter verbs ("she found," "she studied"). The final paragraph achieves high density with every line advancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "frozen dew" and "resonant roots," but several redundancies weaken momentum: "profound, almost painful silence" could be one adjective, "raw, first language" repeats the concept. The "quiet blazing" repetition and some filter constructions ("He understood now") create minor drag without serving pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.4)

    Prose achieves moments of lyric precision ("dreams were no longer solitary mysteries but could be captured, bottled, and shared like vintage wine"). However, several passages contain mild redundancy ("heavy with a regret that seemed to glow inside her") and filter constructions that distance immediacy. The final paragraph's abstract phrasing ("forging her hope into a shield") lacks concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of vivid specificity ("papery fragility," "bulbous eyes") but suffers from repetitive abstract constructions about balance and reconstruction. Template phrases like "This was the method," "This was the balance," "This was the equilibrium" create mechanical cadence, and some metaphorical vehicles strain (trust as "tender shoot" shifts to "shards").

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and effective rhythm, particularly in the surgery sequence. Some overwriting appears ("viscous tendrils," "susurrus") and mild redundancy in explaining the telepathic ability, but information density remains high and the final image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("hushed thunder...rumbled beneath"). Information density high in psychometric sequences. Template cadence in "She found...She focused...She understood" sequence (-0.4). Some abstract phrasing ("aching motivation") but momentum sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, particularly strong in "Where each drop landed, color erupted." However, abstract phrasing accumulates ("hollow, efficient silence," "iron bands constricting," "fragment of remembered stardust") and some redundancy appears ("moonstruck dreamer" paired with "soul pulled by tides"). The journey section summarizes rather than renders specific moments.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. However, some figurative density issues: "quiet fire in her hollow chest," "geological wound," and abstract phrasing around "wave functions" and "collapsing probabilities" accumulate without full clarity. The "immense empathy" line approaches telling over showing.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong sensory specificity and varied sentence structure. Deductions for repetitive "He translocates during sleep" bookending, some abstract phrasing ("probable miracle of this biome"), and occasional register drift into academic tone. Information density is good but inconsistent.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density generally strong—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("untethered and purposeless"), some repetitive phrasing around courage/journey metaphors, and moments where figurative language slightly obscures rather than clarifies ("staining the sky the color of a deep bruise").

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in descriptive passages. Minor issues include occasional overwriting ("seraphically mundane") and one instance of telling what's shown ("a small act of restoration").

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("cathedral of knowledge slowly returning to the void" during action), some template phrasing ("stood at the end of the aisle"), and slight register drift in metaphorical density during the confrontation that doesn't match established voice patterns.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor redundancy appears in "periodically eternal" and some filter constructions ("she felt," "she found"), but these don't touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "graveyard of galactic travel" and effective rhythm variation. Some overwriting appears ("thunderous serenity" paradox, "immense quiet somehow roaring") but serves the accumulative design. Minor redundancy in describing the stones' hum across multiple beats. Information density is good with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences ("Letter by letter, the directive became clear"). Some redundancy appears ("burden and a promise fused together" could be tighter), and the final paragraph contains multiple restatements of the evolution theme that dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong information density and varied rhythm, particularly in grounding sequence. Some elevated diction ("percussive whump," "petrichor") but voice-motivated. Minor deduction for one paraphrase loop ("she would feel the freeze again, she knew" followed by redundant knowing) and occasional filter verbs during crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, though figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("bleeding edges," "luminescent ache," "necessary darkness" cluster densely). Some elevated diction ("inexorable grind," "vellum and ink") fits the literary tone but borders on overwriting; the final paragraph's clarity redeems most excess.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "bleeding from the sky" and "drum against his ribs." Information density high in pattern-description passages. Deductions for abstract phrases that don't fully land: "consciously wild," "serene anger" (used twice), and some elevated diction in peak moments ("eternal cycles and the fragile skin of reality") that creates mild register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("a tomb of knowledge buried deep beneath the perpetual snows"). Some filter verb accumulation ("She imagined," "She waited") in the penultimate paragraph dulls immediacy. The "dizzying quiet" motif effectively bookends the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, though occasional abstract phrasing ("weave continuity through chaos") appears multiple times. Strong verb choices and concrete imagery dominate, but phrases like "senselessly perceptive" and some conceptual repetition create minor density issues. Information packing is generally efficient.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean, propulsive prose with varied syntax and strong imagery. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The metal began to vibrate, and a miraculous property of the Garden was revealed"). Minor deduction for slight overwriting in places ("feral lullaby that promised both rampant dreams and tooth-filled nightmares").

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the ghost of the journalist's call still clinging to the copper-wire receiver." Some redundancy in the orbital metaphor explanations and occasional overwriting ("dark, gravitational body pulling at her principles") create minor drag without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations. Information density is high - most sentences advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("cluttered cavern of brass horns"), some abstract phrasing ("quantum trick"), and slight metaphor density in non-peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some overwriting appears ("emergent hush," "pervasive lilac unease"). Minor template cadence in "She chose...She would seek...Her hands moved" sequence. Information density is strong in descriptive passages but occasionally strains with abstract concepts.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "arms of steel" and the "warm coldness" motif. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive phrasing around "warm coldness" (three uses) and some elevated diction ("aberrant mercy," "progenitor of grace") that occasionally disrupts momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("lattice of frozen music," "shimmering artifacts") occasionally obscures momentum. Some abstract phrasing ("lure possibility from the brink of despair") could be more concrete. The "braided joy with sorrow" section risks becoming abstract despite strong overall execution.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density is solid - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for overwrought phrases ("fractally precise," appears twice; "willowglass hope") and some repetitive constructions around memory description that edge toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some figurative density in the floating sequence ("buoyancy born from overwhelming, ancient wonder"). Template cadence appears briefly ("He would wait... He would show... He would explain"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple story elements simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves lyrical precision in key moments ("dusty, honeyed sheets," "stone sighing"). Some template phrasing appears ("Days bled into one another," "deep, resonant hum") but doesn't obscure closure. Information density is generally strong though a few passages could tighten ("meditation, her hands moving with a gentle certainty").

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density high in opening. Deductions for "breathtaking, insane gamble" (register spike), "fragile thing" (cliché), and some filter constructions ("He saw not a fool's errand"). The "Give me the particulars" line effectively propels toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("his boots dripping onto the wet stone" establishes both character position and atmosphere). Some elevated diction ("palimpsest promise," "spindrift serenity") occasionally strains but serves the meditative tone without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"chimney smoke from her small kiln flattened against the heavy sky" establishes setting, weather, and her craft simultaneously. Minor register drift appears in phrases like "fueled by a legacy of care" and some abstract formulations ("resistance wasn't a passive quality") that could be more concrete, but momentum and clarity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation ("She worked with the rhythm of oars in water, a smooth, steady, pulling motion"). Information density high in passages like the tool description serving multiple purposes. Deductions for redundancy in "wistfully pragmatic"/"wistfully pragmatic acceptance" and slight overwriting in "silent, crimson sigh."

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the climactic sundial sequence. Some abstract phrasing ("profound silence," "immutable as the phases of the moon") and conceptual redundancy around isolation themes create minor density issues but don't touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Strong imagery throughout, particularly "prayer made manifest" and the paper-clay transformation sequence. Some redundancy in describing the connection theme. Minor issues with "inevitably whimsical" appearing twice without clear purpose-driven repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in the building tension of "For hours, they worked" sequence. Information density high in technical passages. Deductions for filter-verb cluster ("seemed to roll," "felt like") and slight template cadence in "She looked... She had... She had won" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though some overwrought moments ("dust-thick blanket," "clammy dread"). Strong propulsion during the mutiny sequence. Minor density issues with stacked metaphors in places ("silver eels," "spatial mutiny," "full-scale rebellion") but clarity remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation between analytical precision ("surgeon's precision...deep, analytical rhythm") and softer feeling-based sentences, though phrases like "lance the abscess of this stagnant file" and "churned like a sleeping beast" strain the metaphorical coherence. Some redundancy appears in explaining Ellis's condition multiple times, and the final paragraph's dialogue edges toward exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts (short, tense sentences during nail-pulling). However, several instances of overwriting ("graveyard of dead screens," "cartographer of a redeemed future") and some redundancy in describing the dread atmosphere detract from otherwise strong line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid specifics like "wet-plate collodion glass flake, chilled and slightly damp." Some overwriting: "furious, rising spark," "absolute silence," "hard, brilliant certainty" accumulate without adding precision. The "scaffold wrap flutters" construction feels artificially inserted rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and strong verb choices. Information density is good with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for redundant phrasing ("circular path" variations), some overwriting in metaphorical passages ("two halves of his father's doomed equation"), and slight template cadence in the middle exposition section.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between waking frustration and dream revelation. Information density is high, with most sentences advancing plot or atmosphere. Some template phrasing appears ("She rushed to," "She began to," "She had to") and the penultimate paragraph contains slight paraphrase loops about shared burdens.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, though several instances of abstract phrasing ("warlike serenity," "purposeful ambiguity") and mild redundancy ("frozen confession" appears four times) create drag. The final paragraph's philosophical framing ("what mirrors truly could not show") edges toward tell over show.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, but overwriting appears in phrases like "silent astronomical concord" and "crystalline elation." Template structures emerge in the vision list ("a falling star, a laughing child, a city of glass") and some metaphor mixing ("symphony" shifts to "conductor" to "anchor").

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong propulsion with varied sentence structures and vivid imagery that advances story without loops. Information density high in descriptive passages. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("gnawing absence," "curdled into despair") but doesn't obscure clarity. Final image effectively recharges opening metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("gargantuan skeletons of excavators"). Minor template cadence in "He had to... He laid it... He looked back..." sequence. The phrase "confidently uncertain" feels forced. Information density is solid, with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure. Several instances of abstract phrasing ("haunted ambition," "aching pressure") and some redundancy around the transition concept. The phrase "touching distance" appears both as required tone and in final paragraph, creating unintended echo. Information density could be higher in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains clarity with varied rhythm, particularly in the integration sequence's flowing description. Some elevated diction ("cavernous space," "fleeting silence") fits the mythic register. Minor redundancy in explaining the process ("refresh," "transfer," "journey," "purification and renewal") creates slight density loss.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose is generally clean but contains loops: "resonant hush" appears twice, "dissolve/dissolving walls" repeats the same metaphor. Template cadence in "She went... She knocked... She simply opened." Information density is moderate; some sentences do single duty where compression could heighten impact.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("The platform was a shattered spine") but suffers from occasional overwriting in metaphor density, particularly the opening's river imagery. Some template phrasing appears ("struck her with the force of a physical blow"). Information density is generally good with most sentences carrying multiple functions, though the final paragraph contains some scaffolding ("The afternoon sun was warm on her skin").

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, particularly in the cipher-solving sequence. However, abstract phrases like "nebulous distance" and "profound, deepening quiet" dilute precision, and the final paragraph contains some redundancy ("two mirrors...cyclically reversed and endlessly unfolding").

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("star-pricked blue velvet," "diamond dust") but some density issues in figurative language. The phrase "perforated destiny" works conceptually but creates mild register drift when internalized. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("the dream of its creation against the cold reality") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"crystalline rock that floated silently amidst the clouds" establishes both setting and tone. Some elevated diction ("radiant grace," "metaphysical boundary") fits the ritual context but occasionally edges toward purple. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("profound loss," "deep disquiet," "absolute understanding") and mild redundancy in emotional descriptors. The phrase "kindly decisive" appears twice verbatim, and some sentences lean on telling rather than embodiment ("Her motivation shifted, refined").

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs ("small, cold weight...hollow mirror shard...professional tool and personal curse"). Minor template cadence appears in "He spoke of...He needed...He offered" but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though several instances of overwriting: "profound and fragile quiet that felt both ancient and new" strains for effect. Strong moments like "Follow the third ring" and the transformation sequence show restraint. Some redundancy in describing Elara's age paradox across multiple sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The deep gorge was a place of bone, not earth") but occasional redundancy ("fleeing" after showing flight, "frantic, chaotic" doubling). Information density is moderate; some sentences do single duty where compression could heighten impact. The "groan that seemed to come from the earth's core" provides effective sensory grounding at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in action sequences. However, the final paragraph contains multiple paraphrase loops ("she had found wonder"/"a quiet testament to the magic that lingers") and the repeated "brilliant dimness" construction, while thematically intentional, creates some redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though "haunting cathedral of water and knowledge" and "constellation born from the earth" edge toward purple. Information density is high with most lines advancing multiple functions, but phrases like "profound and expectant quality" and "simple, perfect note" rely on modifiers over specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("ambered observatory deck," "screaming chorus of every moment"). Some abstract philosophical language ("distill the entirety of condensed reality into a single, perfect frequency") occasionally slows momentum. Minor repetition of "choice/choose" variants, though thematically justified.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues: "utterly alone" is telling what's shown, "ghost of a shared project" edges toward abstraction. The crystallization sequence maintains clarity despite complex imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some ornate phrasing ("the city held its breath," "a thing of glass carefully blown") occasionally slows momentum. The "ping... ping... ping" repetition effectively mirrors the story's patient accumulation theme.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("skeletal outlines of rooftops and church spires breached the mud") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("mirrored hush of the twilight was profound") and redundancy ("forgotten memory" appears twice). Some filter constructions dull immediacy ("He had to expunge it all").

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied syntax, though some overwriting appears ("cascading, shimmering light," "ancient freshness"). Minor template cadence in "She understood...She summoned...She painted" sequence. Information density is good but occasional ornamental phrases don't advance story.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum through varied sentence lengths matching emotional beats. Information density is high, particularly in technical sequences. Deductions for repetitive "silent/soundless" constructions and slight overwriting in "profound loneliness tempered by the weight of absolute responsibility." The "tiny speck of determined light" metaphor feels somewhat stock.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm shifts, though several abstract constructions dilute immediacy ("crushing emotional numbness that had plagued him," "root of the silent, bitter clone custody battle"). Template phrasing appears in the channeling sequence ("He tried again... Each time") but serves accumulative structure. Information density is generally strong with most lines advancing multiple layers.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation and strong information density. Minor repetition of "safeguard" variants and some elevated diction ("nocturnal haven") create slight drag. No major loops or scaffolding, though "storm-born silence" repetition feels deliberate.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid metaphors ("dust sheet, thick and suffocating"). Template cadence appears in middle section ("He yanked...He adjusted...He began") and some paraphrase loops around the grief theme reduce momentum. Final paragraph recovers with powerful closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in lines like "She was re-interiorizing the exterior threat, making it a part of the garden's own story of waiting." Some overwriting appears ("unnervingly warm," "unnaturally sharp") but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("profound revulsion filled him," "crystallized with a sharp, painful clarity"). Mild overwriting in figurative density during the transformation sequence. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, particularly in the experimental process description.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines like "antenna for absence" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in peak beats ("serenely electric sheen") but serves the accumulative pattern. Strong syntactic variety and momentum, though "serenely electric" appears twice without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied syntax and strong imagery. Information density high in crisis beats. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("cavern of impossible dimensions," "luminous web") but doesn't obscure clarity. Final image resonates without loops.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("febrile hallucinations," "rational enchantment," "realistically imaginary") that occasionally obscures clarity. Template cadence in "She recalled... his fear... his longing" sequence. Information density high but sometimes tips into purple territory.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("captured nebulas," "sea of space") but suffers from abstract descriptors and mild redundancy. Phrases like "quiet, burning ache" and "somber marvel" lean conceptual rather than concrete. Some paraphrase loops appear ("expand its understanding"/"expand its journey"), and modifiers occasionally stack ("soft, perpetual blue," "silent, impossible mountain").

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure. Information density is solid—most lines advance atmosphere, action, or stakes. Some elevated diction creeps in ("ephemeral atrium," "profound reassurance") that slightly clashes with POV register. Minor template tendency in "She [verb]" constructions but not pervasive enough for major deduction.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and momentum, though several stock phrases appear ("jagged teeth," "dark maw," "hammering of her own heart"). The phase transition sequence achieves genuine lyricism, but phrases like "standing promise" and "memory of light" edge toward abstraction without sufficient grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density - most sentences advance multiple elements. Excellent rhythm variation and syntactic control. The heartbeat interruptions work as purposeful pattern. Some elevated diction ("ephemeral patterns," "metronomic") fits the voice. Minor deduction for slight abstraction in "fetch wisdom from failure" and one instance of telling in "painstaking.". No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, particularly in the breakthrough sequence. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("immense delicacy," "fragile weaving") and one template phrase ("terrified, Elara almost threw") that could be more specific.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("inverted rain," "dark star in a microcosm") but occasional overwriting ("gravitationally playful energy," "terrible and beautiful integration"). Some abstract phrasing in peak beats ("fierce, empathetic need") dulls immediacy. Information density remains high throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and strong verb choices ("burst," "slammed"). However, several abstract constructions weaken immediacy ("Nothing happened," "There was no time"), and some metaphors feel slightly overworked ("monument to cold function," "sea of polished steel").

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery ("captured lightning flickered and miniature clouds swirled"). Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some repetitive constructions ("He was...", "She was...") and occasional overwriting ("silent, simmering war"). The final paragraph contains some scaffolding that restates rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful repetition ("silent" as pattern). However, several abstract formulations weaken precision: "pressure in her soul," "absolute certainty," "poured every memory." The phrase "quietly persistent" appears twice identically, creating a minor loop.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "busts of melancholic mathematicians" simultaneously establishes setting, tone, and thematic fusion. Some elevated diction risks purple prose ("nascent narratives swimming in the displaced air") but coheres with the literary milieu. Rhythm varies effectively between long descriptive passages and shorter action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.1)
    Generally strong prose with high information density and varied rhythm. However, some figurative density in non-peak moments ("crushed pearls and drowned jewels") and slight register elevation. The "cipher" metaphor recurs without full clarity. No loops or scaffolding, and the closing image lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "hush of cosmic possibility" repeats, mixed metaphors ("ideas hammering" vs "trapped bee"), and abstract elevations that occasionally obscure clarity. The piece would benefit from pruning some ornamental language, particularly in the final paragraph where abstraction accumulates.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with vivid imagery like "blackened skeletons of three merchant vessels." However, "the crisp nostalgia of that half-remembered feeling" is overwrought, and there's slight redundancy in describing the underwater environment. The "quite literally" aside breaks momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some ornamental phrases ("combative tenderness," "forlorn noise") and occasional overwriting. Information density is solid with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor repetition in movement descriptions (backwards walking mentioned multiple times without variation).

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=6.9)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong imagery. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "insatiably creative" reads as label; "fierce and quiet flame within her" is stock metaphor; some redundancy in color descriptions. The mystical sequence contains abstract phrasing ("threads of reality") that dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some paraphrase loops appear ("accumulated silence" concept repeated), and occasional abstract phrasing ("profound quiet" followed by elaboration) creates minor redundancy. The "sleeping serpent" metaphor works well.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears ("rain-scoured" repeated, "perfect, terrifying boundary"). Template cadence in "She had come...she must...she must" sequence. Information density high in discovery sequence but occasional redundancy ("silent, stone-circle echo").

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density and varied syntax. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("cathedral of silence," "mushroom cloud of glittering faux snow") and some abstract phrasing in emotional beats. The filter verb "watched" in the climactic moment slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong moments of propulsion ("Her fingers flew across the console") but suffers from occasional overwriting—"masterpiece of light that burned itself into her vision" and repeated use of "driftingly alert" and "tinkersong wonder" feel templated. The density of figurative language in high-pressure beats ("needle stitching through the chaos") sometimes obscures rather than clarifies action.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks marking discovery beats. Strong specificity in "brass-grated elevator" and "geometric key." Some figurative density in the final paragraph ("keeper of light," "journey forever changed") borders on overwriting but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, though "spooled wholeness" appears twice without clear evolution. Some abstract phrasing ("inaugural laughter from a long-dead king") momentarily dulls immediacy. Strong information density in most beats, particularly the ascent sequence where each sentence advances both physical and emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Some overwriting in metaphorical density ("needle's point," "solidified moonlight") and occasional redundancy ("quiet obsession" could be just "obsession"). The final image powerfully synthesizes all elements without excess.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and effective momentum, but some overwriting appears ("chaotic symphony," "vast ocean of the sky"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple purposes, though phrases like "profound peace it emanated" and "forever onward into the luminous dark" edge toward purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with moments of genuine beauty ("glittering with a cold, silent fire"), but some overwriting in descriptive passages. The "infinite Elians sighing in unison" and the gear-selection sequence show excellent rhythm control. Deductions for density issues: multiple figurative constructions in high-pressure moments and slight redundancy in the opening descriptions of the library's appearance.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "tapestry of cultivated life" and strong rhythm variation. Minor density issues with some ornamental description ("velvety cobalt") and one instance of telling what's shown ("sensing its benevolent nature").

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("stone throat silent," "pane of hush"). Some overwriting in metaphorical density: "celestial mathematics," "music of the spheres," "splinter in time's flow" cluster without full payoff. Template cadence appears briefly ("She saw...She felt..."). Information density high in gear descriptions but occasionally loops conceptually (multiple ways of saying "silence").

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean, propulsive prose with strong rhythm variation and vivid imagery. "Bronze feathers scraping against the rock with a sound like a dying scream" demonstrates effective sensory specificity. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor figurative density in places ("graceless beauty" recurs) but serves the tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose generally flows with purposeful rhythm, particularly in observational passages about foam dynamics and the chrysalis discovery. However, several artifacts mar execution: "braided ravinethe" typo, repetitive "He had come"/"He would go back" constructions, and conceptual loops in the final paragraph that restate rather than deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong rhythm variation and high information density. Some elevated diction ("substrates," "integrated fragmentation") fits the otherworldly setting but occasionally approaches register drift. The surgical metaphor sustains without mixing, and the final image lands with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong moments like "mason's pride in the precise joinery" and "chef's discipline of balancing flavors," though some passages tend toward abstraction ("concentrated essence of every sorrow"). The paraphrase loop in "rendered it peaceful"/"finally cleansed" weakens the ending's precision. Information density is generally high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("under the hush of borrowed starlight," "steady, weary tick") with strong rhythm variation. Information density is high—most sentences advance both literal and symbolic layers. Some abstract phrasing ("realignment of its essence," "interspersing languages") and slight redundancy in the silos' responses prevent higher scoring. The template "It spoke of... answered with..." structure briefly emerges.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("moonlit canyon was a gash of silver and shadow"). Some density issues with figurative language in places ("quaking reverie" appears twice, slight overwriting in the vision sequence). Information density is high and sentences consistently advance story, though a few phrases edge toward purple.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose maintains clarity and momentum with varied sentence structures. Information density is solid - most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor template patterns appear ("She understood now," "She reached out") and some metaphorical language accumulates without full payoff, but overall craft supports the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph lengths. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. However, template constructions appear ("She would trace," "She would press," "She began to work") and some paraphrase loops occur around the silence concept, creating mild drag.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation. Information density high in opening. Some elevated diction in closure ("terrible, beautiful truth," "beauty was the move that healed the board") creates mild register drift from established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation and sensory specificity. Some elevated diction in peak moments ("limitless, theatrical sincerity," "generous ears") creates minor register drift. Template phrasing appears briefly ("She had found...She had recovered") but doesn't pervade. Information density is good with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose occasionally loops concepts ("serenity within motion, a perfect stillness at the heart of a bustling life" restates rather than develops). Some elevated diction ("liminal hour," "epicenter") slightly strains the herbalist's practical voice, though the sensory specificity of the climactic scent description maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Minor issues with occasional elevated diction ("intrepid," "vast, fruit-laden groves") and one instance of telling rather than showing ("Kaelen understood") at a pivotal moment.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong momentum, particularly in discovery sequences. Information density high—most sentences advance plot, atmosphere, or understanding simultaneously. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("thick, woolen blanket smothering"), some template phrasing ("her mind racing ahead of her feet"), and the abstract "temporal pulling" concept that lacks concrete grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations matching the story's meditative-to-ecstatic arc. Some elevated diction borders on purple ("great curtains of emerald and violet and rose") but serves the synesthetic experience. Minor density issues with figurative language in the climax. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("sound was a currency spent long ago"). Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Some figurative density in places ("avalanchingly quiet," "fertile ground of failure") without becoming purple. Occasional abstraction ("desperate curiosity," "painful clarity") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose achieves high density with lines like "She was the subject and the scientist, and she was cracking" that advance multiple threads simultaneously. Minor template repetition in "She felt the despair...She felt the buoyant joy" structure, though it serves the accumulative pattern. Strong syntactic variety and zero paraphrase loops.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts from nervous fragmentation to flowing transformation sequences. Minor redundancies ("fading ache, a story slipping from memory to myth" followed later by "road between memory and myth") and some elevated diction in peak moments ("germinate," "luminous and transient") create slight friction without harming closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though some overwrought phrases appear ("the universe whispering a truthful lie"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers. Deduction for abstract conceptual language in the revelation sequence that occasionally obscures clarity ("the emotion of existence itself").

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("fingers stained with dye and memory"), but several abstract phrases resist concrete grounding ("vigil maintained through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry"). The "stoically sparkling" repetition works as pattern-teaching. Minor scaffold in explaining the silence's nature twice ("not an absence, but an active undoing" echoes the earlier description).

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm shifts, but several template constructions weaken momentum: "She knew how to heat it, fold it, and shape it" follows mechanical listing. The repeated "azure defiance" phrase and some abstract telling ("Her motivation was not just to rebuild, but to coax resilience") create minor drag without touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("symphony of rust and silence"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the vision sequence and occasional elevated diction ("terrible purpose").

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong sensory grounding and propulsive syntax, particularly in "The lamp flickered once, twice, and died."

The cairn-building sequence achieves excellent clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose shows strong moments ("river of green fire circulating in a perfect, endless loop") but suffers from repetitive structures and some overwriting. Multiple sentences beginning with "He" or "The" create monotony. Phrases like "profound, fearful awe" and "wild, triumphant elation" pile modifiers unnecessarily.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "The wing was not merely blue; it was a lesson in iridescent caution." Excellent rhythm variation between long contemplative sentences and short declarations. Some minor redundancy in the middle section's description of following light trails prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The tower, usually dark, was now lit from within by the flicker of far-off lightning." However, some figurative density appears without payoff ("bruised evening sky," "liquid silver") and occasional register elevation ("atomized and cast adrift") creates mild friction with the established voice.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("threads of luminescence," "cloth spun from shadow and hope") but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear pattern-teaching. Several abstract constructions slow momentum ("the very essence of their salvation," "profound bound release"). Some paraphrase loops appear, particularly around memory/forgetting concepts repeated across adjacent passages.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression, though several abstract constructions dilute momentum ("fragile but persistent thing," "alien and inevitable"). The metaphor of error as "seed holding a poisonous flower" lands effectively, but some passages lean toward elevated diction that occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, but "heuristically gentle" appears twice verbatim, and phrases like "creeping normality" and "quiet attrition" edge toward academic register. Some redundancy in describing the courtyard's transformation. Information density is good but inconsistent, with occasional scaffolding around the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves atmospheric density but suffers from ornamental phrases like "quartz hush of settling ice" and occasional redundancy ("measured decay"/"slow entropy"). Some metaphors strain clarity ("sampling frequencies" process), and filter constructions ("she knew," "she saw") diminish immediacy in key discovery moments.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    Generally clean propulsion with vivid specificity like "skeletal legs" and "bottled tempest." However, abstract phrasing clusters in peak moments ("profound, weary sadness," "last vestige of her belief") and some redundancy ("shared history and present betrayal") reduce density.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("valleys that only voted in twilight," "futuristic nostalgia for a truth that was only now arriving"), though some phrases edge toward overwriting ("terrestrially cosmic," "bio-celestial tapestry"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, but occasional abstract phrasing ("pattern larger than logic") could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. Some figurative density in the cave sequence ("The light did not illuminate the cave; it poured from the cave") approaches overwriting without pattern-teaching. Template cadence appears briefly ("He painted not from memory...He had not simply found...") but recovers in the final lines.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, but several instances of telling over showing ("desperate motivation," "anxious days") and some abstract phrasing ("testament to beauty persisting"). The final paragraph's "she grew" lands with economy, though middle sections could be tighter.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, but several overwrought phrases strain credibility ("cloth of spun moonlight," "symphony of things as they were meant to be"). Some template cadence appears in the repair sequence ("She adjusted... She shifted... She polished") though it partially serves the methodical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some overwriting appears in peak moments ("spectrum of chaotic light," "swarming lights and shadows," "brilliantly dark point"). Template phrasing in "K-27 [verb]" structure appears 4+ times. The technical/poetic register mix occasionally muddles clarity, particularly in the fear manifestation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with evocative phrases like "the sandstorm calm" and "a landscape of pain and regret," though some passages suffer from abstraction ("profound solidarity of a witness") and repetitive structures. The metaphor consistency holds throughout, and the rhythm varies appropriately with emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("cathedral of corroded brass and fractured glass," "patient, inexorable purpose"). The phrase "mysterious familiarity" feels forced, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("she felt no fear").

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and information density, particularly in the discovery sequence. Minor scaffold appears in "She understood her task. She had to exhume" (paraphrase loop) and some filter verb clustering ("she felt," "she believed"), preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, especially in the climactic paragraph's building intensity. Information density high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor deductions for occasional abstraction ("paradox of immense power") and slight repetition of "quiet/silence" vocabulary.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.8)
    "Patiently nimble" appears twice creating repetitive phrasing (-0.4). Untranslated character "透明" breaks reading flow (-0.3). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("celestial spectacle," "silent detonations") but doesn't obscure closure. Otherwise clean prose with good momentum and varied sentence structure.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density is high in descriptive passages. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("necessary isolation," "life half-lived") and slight overwriting in metaphorical sections that could be more grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose is generally clean with strong moments ("each heavy, resonant plink marking the passage of a moment she could not afford to waste"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("cathedral of stone," "pearl twilight") but serves atmosphere. Information density is good—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("quieter, more desperate need") where concrete detail would strengthen.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence rhythm and purposeful repetition of sound imagery. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("opalescent and cool," "breathtaking cathedral") and one instance of telling what could be shown ("Her motivation was simple").

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple layers. However, several instances of overwriting appear: "cacophony of final regrets and terror," "vast, somnolent mosaic." The adjective stacking in places ("frigid and still," "rough-hewn altar") could be pruned for greater impact.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves lyrical density with purposeful repetition ("hidden" appears strategically). Some elevated diction ("scintillatingly somber," "demure audacity") occasionally strains but mostly serves atmosphere. Minor redundancy in explaining moon paths ("subtle angles of lunar light") and some abstract phrasing ("perfect, hidden whole") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrasing ("tapestry of comfortable lies stretched over ugly truths") and occasional redundancy ("violent gust shook"). Strong information density in the letter reconstruction sequence. The final paragraph achieves good resonance despite one instance of elevated diction ("newly scoured landscape").

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "each lightning strike a momentary sun," though occasional overwriting appears ("brutal pull of variant allegiance, a tear in his very soul"). Minor template cadence in "He could serve...or he could follow" structure and some abstract phrasing ("variant allegiance") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though several instances of elevated diction ("lonesome splendor," "archeologist of joy") and some redundancy in describing the searching process. The paraphrase "He was no longer just a translator, but a conduit" restates rather than advances.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several clarity issues: "fleshly ethereal" is opaque, "temperamentally calibrated to be logically emotional" reads as awkward construction, and some purple prose moments ("sunset bleeding across the sky"). Information density is generally good but hampered by occasional overwriting and one instance of near-paraphrase ("violent grinding did not just stop; it transformed").

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "mercury-bright gleam" and "stone waking from a millennia-long sleep." However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "patient revolution" concept restated multiple times, and some template phrasing in transitions ("She stood," "She checked," "She looked").

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("forgotten artery of the city"). Some overwriting in the psychic sequence with stacked abstractions ("violent cascade of entangled memories"). Minor template cadence in "She was... She would..." construction. The final paragraph contains unnecessary exposition that could trust the dramatization more.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("disemboweled music boxes," "vibrant hush"). Some register drift in the final paragraph ("relentless, deliberate action, a choosing, over and over") approaches therapy-speak. Occasional filter constructions ("he understood") in peak moments reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The workshop was a sanctuary of logic in a world of chaotic chemistry." However, the algorithm explanation contains mild paraphrase loops ("the silent, mathematical undercurrent" followed by "The algorithm was the itch") and occasional register elevation ("transliterate hope back into the algorithm") that creates distance. No artifacts touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations tracking discovery beats. Deductions for abstract phrasing ("masterpiece of omission," "profound, sensed absence") and some repetitive structures. The captain's fragmented transmission provides effective syntactic break. Minor template cadence in middle investigation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves clarity with purposeful rhythm variation, though several abstract phrases weaken immediacy ("profound understanding," "dynamic force"). The mirror sequence demonstrates strong information density with each reflection advancing the vision. Minor template cadence appears in the mobilization paragraph ("She used... She showed them...") but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("calved and floating," "wind's solacing hymn"). Some abstract phrasing early ("hyper-sensitivity to the world's subtle textures") and occasional elevated diction ("travailed through disaster") create minor friction. Information density is good but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.0)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("gnarled vines, their leaves aflame in the autumn light") but suffers from abstract patches and filter-heavy constructions ("She understood her motivation now was to extend..."). Information density varies, with some paragraphs doing multiple jobs while others loop through similar emotional territory without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.0)
    Clean, purposeful prose with strong information density—nearly every line advances story, atmosphere, or theme simultaneously. Syntax varies appropriately with scene rhythm. Minor repetition of "peripheral" concepts, but this reinforces the central method rather than creating loops. No scaffold or paraphrase issues.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose generally maintains clarity and momentum, with effective variation in sentence structure. Information density is adequate though some passages contain mild redundancy ("grim monument"/"skeletal walls"). The phrase "earnest whimsy" appears verbatim from the prompt, and occasional elevated diction ("potent, magical warmth") creates register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation. However, abstract phrases like "weathered innocence" and "fossil record of collective thought" drift into academic register. Some redundancy in explaining the chandelier's nature. The "gentle storm" oxymoron strains.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance both external search and internal state. Some figurative density in places ("fish that slipped through her hands," "swimming in tidal longing") but serves the lyric mode. Minor repetition of "profound and sorrowful" and "tidal longing" concepts. The closing image achieves strong resonance with "silent, holding everything."

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose is generally clean with good momentum, though some repetitive structures appear ("She had," "She was"). Minor scaffold in emotional labeling ("profound luminous ache of its loss"). Strong opening and closing lines frame the piece well.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("finding the sacred in the simple"). However, "pulsing stillness" repeats without evolution, some phrases edge purple ("etched with pain"), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("She watched as the tension left"). The "scratch-and-hiss" passage achieves excellent sensory precision.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves clarity with moments of elegance: "a deep, resonant hum, a release of pent-up potential." Information density remains high throughout. Template cadence appears in the reconstruction sequence ("She fed...showed it...asked it") and some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("She could not simply ask it; she would have to relearn its language alongside it").

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with evocative moments like "fountain that wept iron-rich water." Some overwriting in "nostalgic innovation" and "alchemy: to turn mistakes into constellations." The phrase "shrewdly innocent" appears twice verbatim. Minor filter verb clustering in the Fae realm section.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong moments like "It didn't blaze; it breathed" and maintains good rhythm variation. Information density is generally high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("emerald moss," "golden prison"). However, several instances of overwriting ("honeyed hush lay over the cavernous hall," "healing the broken frequencies") and abstract phrasing ("graft new meaning onto old wounds") that could be more concrete. Some redundancy in describing the setting's quietness.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful variation, though some abstract phrasing ("terminally blocked," "ephemeral cameo appearances") and mild redundancy in describing collected hopes. Strong opening and closing lines. Minor scaffold in the reflection passages but doesn't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("The grey husk began to shimmer, absorbing the music and the light") but suffers from occasional overwriting and repetitive structures. Multiple "began to" constructions weaken immediacy. Some purple prose tendencies ("colossal sphere of burnished copper," "gossamer and golden") slow momentum in places where cleaner language would serve better.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs - "The star-ink did not scratch the surface; it seeped into the metal." Some overwriting in "perpetual twilight" and "profound silence" clusters early. Template cadence appears briefly with "She did not..." constructions but resolves. The prose achieves strong momentum through the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some density issues appear ("complex, ancient device of interwoven brass and crystal"). The typo "tuned水晶 prisms" breaks immersion, and occasional elevated diction ("polyphonic hymn of returning sound") slightly overreaches.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, though occasional density of figurative language ("whalebone reverie," "architecture of loss") in consecutive sentences creates slight overwriting. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in "She could feel... She tried... She could only watch" sequence deducts slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in passages like "ash wood, its grain like a map of forgotten rivers." However, abstract phrasing appears in peak moments ("harvest lessons from loss," "love's quiet architecture") and some metaphors strain slightly ("his absence had its own weather"). The template structure "He was here... and he was gone" works as purposeful parallelism.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "Silence was the true ghost" and varied sentence structure. However, abstract phrasing clusters appear ("calcified," "palimpsest," "fractured stillness") and some paraphrase loops exist around erosion/ambition concepts. The "chronologically confused" section feels scaffolded with tell-heavy exposition about her method.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Some abstraction creeps in ("equations for hope," "skeleton waiting for a new nervous system") that could be more concrete. The final paragraph achieves strong momentum, though middle sections occasionally drag with process description.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("crystal whispering forecourt after a night's rain" establishes setting, time, and mechanism). Some figurative density in the bear description borders on overwriting but serves the fantastical moment. Minor template cadence in "It was... It was... It moved..." sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some elevated diction ("palpable thing," "serene upheaval") occasionally strains. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Minor redundancy in explaining the legend's purpose twice. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend the silence/sound motif.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong opening establishes voice and atmosphere efficiently. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, world, or discovery simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("infinite patience," "oceanic hush") occasionally drifts from the established register, and "philosophical seed collector" explanations edge toward exposition. The closing image of fog lifting to reveal "ghostly outlines" effectively mirrors Elara's clarified understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.1)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Information density high throughout. Some figurative density in opening paragraph ("geography of healing, a map he traced not with ink") and occasional elevated diction ("lonesome splendor") that slightly slows momentum. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("tears cutting clean paths through the grime") but suffers from abstraction loops ("profound loss and impossible hope," "succeeded and failed, completely and utterly"). Some template phrasing appears ("For a long moment," "Then, a sound emerged"). Information density is moderate; several sentences could do more work.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "foreign coin drilled and strung on a red thread...looted from some forgotten job, his one offering of an apology." Some figurative language accumulates heavily ("song of stress and fracture and healing," "the music she had made from the silence") but serves the accumulative design rather than obscuring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, though some density issues in figurative language: "defiant hush," "tangible vibration," "feathery quiet" cluster without full payoff. Information density varies; the fountain sequence could compress. Strong opening and closing lines that bookend the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm, though some figurative density approaches overwriting ("the quiet sigh of falling petals, a metaphor for the slow, beautiful dissolution"). Template repetition of "generational pattern" (3x) creates minor loop. Strong information density in most passages, with effective variation in sentence length supporting the contemplative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose flows with varied rhythm and sophisticated syntax, particularly in descriptive passages. Some redundancy appears ("beautiful and heartbreaking," "profound and endless turning") and the penultimate paragraph contains mild overwriting, but overall the line-level craft supports the meditative tone effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, though some passages tend toward overwriting ("jagged, glassy expanse of the tidal obsidian ridge"). Information density is moderate—most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Notable template cadence in the middle section with repetitive "He [verb]" constructions. The corrupted character (轴) is a technical error.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "stars were sharp and cold" and purposeful rhythm variation. Some overwriting appears in the sensory surge sequence ("ghost of a hand...breath on her neck...metallic taste") and mild redundancy in "finally concluded" after establishing completion. Information density is moderate; several sentences could carry more weight.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum. Some overwriting appears ("sacred duty," "pure potential," "symphony of data"). The phrase "groundedly imaginative, a necessary contradiction" works well. Minor issues with elevated diction in places but doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("ember alcove," "thistled calm"), but several template phrases weaken impact: "moved through the muted world," "heart thumping a strange rhythm," "sob caught in throat." The extended metaphorical ending ("seeds," "revolution," "fertile") accumulates without adding new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but abstract phrases like "somber marvel of the moment" and "painful, perfect truth" lack concrete specificity. Some filter-verb clusters ("she understood," "she felt") dull immediacy in middle passages.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose generally flows with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm, though occasional overwriting appears ("furious peace of a scholar"). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing both plot and atmosphere. Some philosophical passages border on abstraction but remain grounded in concrete imagery. The "rationally rebellious" phrase appears twice, creating minor repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("a map of forgotten craft," "shimmering braid of tone") but suffers from abstract telling ("distrust that took time to dissolve") and filter-verb clusters ("She looked at them," "She lifted"). The phrase "unlearning hatred" appears twice without concrete embodiment, creating conceptual redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("wept orange tears onto the cracked stone floor") with good syntactic variety. However, some passages lean toward overwriting ("devotion that bordered on obsession," "reverent hands") and there's occasional template phrasing ("This changed when," "Finally, Elara tasted"). The molecular gastronomy section effectively balances technical precision with lyrical description.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. "The city was dark, a silent expanse beneath a sky the color of spilled honey and wine" sets strong tone. Minor deductions for occasional overwriting ("crushing routine of daily life") and some predictable phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, though occasional elevated diction ("consecration," "sanctified") slightly strains the intimate register. Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in the ritual sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions like "foxglove-stained glass ampoule, shaped like a closing blossom." Some elevated diction in peak beats ("cascading revelation unraveling the prison's magic") creates minor opacity. Template phrase "felt like another age" and abstract phrasing around "nuance" and "certainty" create slight momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.5)
    Clean prose with varied syntax and strong information density, particularly in technical passages. Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("geometric purgatory," "exogenous variable") but serves the mathematical POV. The final paragraph's "grim optimist in an infinite world" effectively echoes the opening without redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythm variation and information density, with lines like "Its handle was worn smooth by generations of hands" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in places ("vessel for its soft, silver light") but generally serves the accumulative mode. Minor template cadence in the opening with repeated "she/her" constructions.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.1)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is good but some phrases edge toward overwriting ("sweet, cloying scent of nostalgia masking a sharp, cutting fear"). Minor redundancies in emotional description. The final paragraph achieves strong momentum despite length.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose demonstrates strong momentum with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm shifts, though occasional overwriting appears ("The bleak exhilaration of his task was a cold fire in his veins"). Information density is high, with most sentences advancing multiple story elements, but some metaphoric density in peak beats reduces clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm and strong imagery. Information density is high—most sentences advance multiple story functions. Some repetitive structures in the middle section ("He found...He wrote") and occasional overwriting ("repulsive allure" used twice, "grim hope"). The opening and closing lines effectively frame the transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, though some overwriting appears ("sketched resonance," "fractal generating core"). Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some elevated diction borders on purple prose but serves the mythic tone. "Restless euphony" and similar phrases edge toward thesaurus-itis without quite breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density high in the heart-chamber sequence. Deductions for template cadence in middle exposition ("The Council...but Elara felt," "For years, Elara had studied") and some abstract phrasing ("sunwashed dread," "pervasive anxiety") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("a dusty sanctum that smelled of decaying paper and resignation"). However, several instances of overwriting mar peak beats: "cathedral of neglect" and mixed metaphor of ivy both strangling and pushing. Template cadence appears in Elara's evidence presentation ("She showed him how... how..."). The final paragraph contains some scaffolding ("shining and new") that dulls the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong moments like "bones of a forgotten leviathan" and "the sea sucking greedily at his boots" show careful craft. However, abstract phrasing weakens key beats: "a vocation that required the cover of darkness" could be more concrete. Some metaphor density in the middle section ("archive of sighs") borders on overwriting. The final image lands cleanly despite these friction points.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments - "pressure-heavy hush" alliterates purposefully. However, several instances of telling over showing ("Frustration, a rare visitor, began to creep in") and some redundancy ("calm surety" after establishing tranquil perception). The phrase "reclaimed stillness" appears twice, though this serves thematic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful imagery. Information density high in transformation sequences. Deductions for occasional abstract phrasing ("void so profound," "brutal weight") and slight overwriting in metaphorical passages ("ascending while descending" concept stretched). No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong moments like "the air...tasted of ozone and cold metal" but suffers from abstract density in places ("a symphony of overlapping, half-seen frequencies"). Some redundancy appears in the awakening sequence, and phrases like "intangibly tangible" repeat without adding precision.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("star trails frozen in mid-motion") but occasionally loops concepts ("frequency of belonging" appears multiple times without variation). Some filter constructions ("She saw," "She understood") dull immediacy in key beats. Rhythm varies effectively between action and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of strong imagery ("dusk began to bleed into the horizon") but contains scaffold phrases ("she told herself," "It was here that"). Information density is good with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deductions for repetitive "weight" metaphor and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong atmospheric density with phrases like "a seam in the world stitched together only by tentative truces." Some repetitive phrasing ("furrowed hush" appears twice) and slight overwriting in metaphoric density ("profound emotional arithmetic"). The filter verb "understood" in paragraph 6 dulls immediacy at a crucial realization moment.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph structure. Strong opening "splintered wooden tongue" and closing symmetry. Major deduction for the Chinese character error ("静止") that breaks immersion, and some elevated diction ("antithesis of celestial grace," "grand, demanding calculus") that creates mild register drift. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("The clinic's promise of a clean slate was technically true") but suffers from occasional overwriting ("firmament of glittering mineral deposits") and one clear paraphrase loop ("not avoidance, but integration" restates the preceding sentence). Information density generally strong with multi-purpose sentences, though some metaphoric excess in descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "fruit that shone like captured stars" and effective rhythm variation. However, some redundancy appears in the memory-conjuring sequence ("He remembered...He remembered..."), and phrases like "reluctant metamorphosis" and "bond beyond death" repeat without adding pressure. The filter-verb cluster in paragraph 3 ("He closed...to feel...to achieve") slightly dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "the crack was not a flaw but a conduit." Some density issues with stacked metaphors ("each second...felt like a theft, a particle of sand lost in an infinite desert") and occasional elevated diction that borders on purple ("magnificent, star-dusted sky"). The reversal sequence maintains good momentum despite these minor ornamental excesses.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of beauty ("ghostly resolve," "frozen echoes of billions") but suffers from density issues—multiple abstract concepts stack without concrete grounding. Template cadence appears in "It was..." constructions. The filter-verb stack in paragraphs 4-5 reduces immediacy during crucial accumulation beats.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("dry earth of countless causes"). Some overwriting appears ("vibrant hush that was not an absence of sound but a presence of something waiting" could compress). Minor template cadence in "She had...She felt...She knelt" sequence but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm, particularly in action sequences. Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some overwriting appears: "vigilant guardian" redundant with "sentinel," "profound dark" where "darkness" suffices, and slight template cadence in "He moved... He ran... He worked." The opening and closing lines effectively frame the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "a river of possible futures, each one a sharp, splintered shard." However, some redundancy appears: "silent, beautiful tormentor" and "silent, frictionless sea" repeat the adjective unnecessarily. The phrase "harmonious chord" introducing the transformation feels slightly stock for such a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("storm-kissed wonder") but suffers from density issues - nearly every sentence contains figurative language, creating fatigue. Some phrases feel overwrought ("architecture of a life reveals its true, fragile design"), though the darkroom sequence maintains strong momentum through concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm during the combat sequence. However, several instances of elevated diction border on purple prose ("violent poetry of their conflict," "crystalline space"), and there's some conceptual redundancy in explaining the duel-as-code concept. The filter verb "saw" in paragraph 4 could be stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("molts personalities monthly"), but several instances of elevated register ("monumental wreckage," "blooming resistance") and filter constructions ("he felt," "he learned") dull immediacy. The paraphrase loop in "he was rebuilt/had been rebuilt" weakens the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with effective rhythm variation, particularly in "She played the flicker" section. Some figurative density in opening paragraph ("steely longing," "ghostly goodbyes," "pocket of solace") without full payoff. The ending's "quiet note that hung in the air until the horizon invited night" effectively echoes the timeframe element.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("bruised purple," "collective memory using her as its conduit"). Information density is strong—most sentences advance multiple story elements. Some filter verb clustering in the dream sequence ("She saw...felt...heard") reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("words arriving like the patient drip of water from a leaf") but suffers from occasional abstract elevation and repetitive color motifs. Information density is generally strong with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some filter-verb clusters ("He could not form," "He understood now") dull immediacy. The paraphrase loop around "cerulean regret" and color descriptions creates mild redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally excellent, with high information density and strong rhythmic control. Sentences are purposeful and advance the story. A minor instance of thesaurus-churn is detected ("permanent silence" followed by "finality" and "precise location" feels slightly redundant). The phrase "chased stillness" is repeated effectively, teaching a pattern that pays off in the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is concise and vivid, with high information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language ("sun bled into the valleys") serves purpose without muddle. No loops, scaffold, or artifactual phrasing. Sentence-level propulsion accelerates with Kael's investigation, and the final line resolves with image-driven resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong information density. A minor figurative muddle exists in the phrase "foggy lucidity," which slightly obscures sense at a key descriptive moment. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and propulsion, and the closure beat is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Minor deductions for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in high-pressure beats (e.g., "the grain of years") which creates a small density artifact, and a near-paraphrase loop ("unpick that stitch... disintegrate the knot").

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and dense, but this density occasionally borders on overwriting in peak beats, with stacked modifiers and complex metaphors that slightly slow momentum (e.g., "a beautiful idea forced to exist in an ugly, broken world"). The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent, with varied rhythms and strong, concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the climax ("dissonant chord of yellow anxiety and gray despair"), though it is voice-motivated and does not obscure clarity. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless, with zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong, vivid, and purposeful. A minor artifacting penalty for a slight filter-verb stack ("she knew how to liberate it") and a register drift in the peak climax ("A feeling of luminous disbelief washed over her—not that she had succeeded, but that such beauty could even exist"), which edges into telling a complex emotional state rather than fully embodying it.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a moment of slightly overripe metaphor ("cascade of diamonds" for breaking ice) that briefly nudges toward decorative description in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, the line-level craft is exceptional and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.6)
    Line-level craft is generally excellent with high information density and purposeful sensory detail. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in the opening metaphor ("transformative acid") which feels slightly elevated for the otherwise concrete and embodied prose that follows.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and rhythmic variety. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the peak beat ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "resinous") which, while beautiful, momentarily risks softening the precise clarity of the closure image. No loops, scaffold, or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language is precise and voice-motivated ("the sound of spacetime being tuned").

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple duties of character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "It was ambiguously clear" is slightly redundant, but it's a hairline slip that does not obscure clarity or harm the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density ("a blooming withering that was both beautiful and sad"). Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("cracks gleamed like silver veins"). No loops or artifacts; sentences advance character and atmosphere with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.4)

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language ("floating like a coffin") is potent and purposeful. A single minor artifact: "symphonious shudder" slightly strains the metaphor but does not obscure clarity or harm the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose is masterful. Sentences are dense and propulsive, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. Figurative language is consistent, vivid, and never muddled ("bone-deep ache," "auroral sorrow"). There are zero loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. The read-aloud rhythm is varied and compelling. The final line lands with immense power and clarity.

There are no discernible loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Sentence-level propulsion is strong, accelerating tension and breathing in quieter moments without losing momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative muddle occurs in the peak beat: describing the light as "pure, unfiltered reality, screaming" mixes metaphors (visual/auditory) in a way that slightly obscures the moment's clarity, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and clarity, though a minor register drift occurs in the peak beat with "gossamer" and "ghost of a note," slightly softening the tactile immediacy. Otherwise, sentences are concise and propel momentum, with high information density and no loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush, precise, and highly atmospheric, with excellent rhythmic control. Minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in a few high-pressure beats (e.g., "archeologist of cataclysm," "performing an autopsy") that, while effective, borders on over-writing. Otherwise, it is exceptionally clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences advance story and atmosphere concisely. A single, minor loop exists in the description of Eli's power ("by directing flow, by placing a single, perfect stone"), but it is pattern-taught and purposeful, thus not penalized.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely precise and vivid, with strong rhythm and momentum. A minor artifact penalty (-0.3) for the slightly mixed metaphor of the audio "net" and logical "snare" in close proximity, though it does not significantly obscure clarity. The closure image remains potent and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional. Prose is dense, rhythmic, and devoid of scaffolding or loops.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("meticulous storm," "documented the most dangerous one"). No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts detract from the closure's power.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. One minor rhythm stumble in the long sentence describing the emerged scent ("a complex emission of...") slightly slows momentum, preventing a higher score. Otherwise, clean and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in "ethically playful nudge," which feels slightly academic for the POV, though it does not significantly harm clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.7)
    Exemplary line-level craft with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language is precise and purposeful ("the chronic hush was not empty"), never muddying clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally concise and vivid with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifacts include a slightly mixed metaphor ("fracture and die" for echoes) and a trace of explanatory language in the Warden's dialogue. These do not significantly harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for a slight register elevation in the climax ("Understanding bloomed, cold and beautiful") which, while voice-motivated, borders on the abstract. Otherwise, sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere with concision and momentum. No loops or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight register drift in phrases like "sapphire hush," which, while beautiful, edges toward the decorative under pressure. However, this is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure, and the sentence-level propulsion remains excellent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A single, minor artifact exists: the phrase "circuitously sincere" introduces a slightly elevated, authorial register that clashes minutely with the POV's lexicon, preventing a 9+ score.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("a grey smear of frustration"). A minor deduction for a potential paraphrase loop in describing the pool's light, though it doesn't harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exquisite with high information density and vivid imagery. Minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a slight paraphrase loop between "profound and static silence" and "profound, velvety blackness," and the phrase "bright darkness" is repeated, slightly dulling its impact on second use.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted, with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is precise and purposeful, not ornamental ("the harbor was the color of bone"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. The final line lands with powerful resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density, though occasional phrases ("cartographer of the unseen") edge toward decorative. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle; sentence-level propulsion is strong. Read-aloud rhythm is varied and purposeful, supporting momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with sentences advancing story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final paragraph’s cadence shift (“and he believed”) is perfectly timed and resonant, serving as a decisive closure image without explanatory summary.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and highly economical, with strong sentence-level propulsion. A minor artifact: the phrase "a spatial mutiny, a rebellion of coordinate and vector" leans slightly toward thematic echo but is saved by its concrete, active verbs and immediate integration into the causal chain. Otherwise, there are no loops, scaffold, or muddle. The final image is clear and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("liquefied her anger"). Rhythm is varied and propulsive. No loops, scaffolds, or artifacts. The final line is a masterful, resonant image that encapsulates the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally exquisite, with high information density and vivid, specific imagery. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the climax ("a palimpsest of invented histories, narratives woven from light and sound"), where the figurative language stacks and slightly muddles the sentence's clarity in a high-pressure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with high information density and rhythmic control. A single minor artifact exists: the phrase "abstracted, two-dimensional representation of death" feels slightly academic for the POV's peak moment, creating a tiny register drift (-0.1). Otherwise, flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, concise, and propelled by strong verbs and vivid imagery. Rhythm is varied and supports the emotional cadence, particularly in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and precise, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a slight register elevation in phrases like "primed for the first awakening," which feels slightly analytical for the POV's moment of peak sensory experience.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A minor figurative muddle occurs in the climax: describing the sound as "not a sound, but a wave" is slightly contradictory, and "unstructured possibility" is abstract under high pressure. However, the closure image remains clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent. A slight deduction for figurative density in the final paragraphs ("reef-shadow joy," "photosynthesized the agony") which, while beautiful, edges toward over-writing in the peak beat without a clear pattern-teaching payoff earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and lyrical, with strong rhythmic control. However, a minor figurative overload occurs in the climax beat, with a cluster of complex metaphors ("reckoning," "signature," "testament") within a few lines, creating a slight muddle that briefly obscures the crystal-clear causality of the epiphany. The sentence-level propulsion is otherwise excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the peak beat ("a hard softness," "alchemized") which, while effective, brushes against ornamentation.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, serving the atmosphere and concept. A minor instance of near-synonymy ("elusive" painter who "disappeared into the shadows") is a hairline slip but does not touch closure or obscure sense.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, though slightly overwritten in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a performance of flawless grace, yet beneath it lay a flawed beauty"). A minor deduction for a paraphrase loop: "the price had been paid" slightly restates "redemption was a ledger of pain" without new pressure. No artifacts harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exceptional, with high information density and vivid, concrete imagery. The sentence "It was cool and impossibly smooth, a perfect ossified tear" is a masterclass in concision.

However, a minor flaw prevents a 9+ score: a slight over-density of figurative language in a high-pressure beat ("desperate silence," "pressure against Silas's calm," "vibrating with a desperate silence") clusters within a few lines, creating a momentary, mild strain on clarity. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly dense and purposeful, with excellent rhythmic variety. A minor template cadence appears in the description of the garage sale items (“Vase, slightly cracked...”; “Bird, wind-up...”), though it is arguably pattern-taught.

    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences advance multiple duties of character, atmosphere, and plot. One potentially mixed metaphor ("woven hush" vs. "invisible thread") is a hairline slip, but it does not harm clarity or momentum at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor deduction for a slight density of figurative language in the opening paragraph ("forged hush," "needle stitching the heavy sky") which, while beautiful, momentarily risks overshadowing the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense and evocative with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: a slight register drift in the phrase "manageable mono-din" feels slightly academic for the POV's lexicon in a peak beat. Otherwise, clarity and momentum are maintained, and the closure image is powerful and clear.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "a act of understanding" contains a grammatical slip (article-noun agreement). This is a hairline flaw that does not touch the closure unit but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptionally strong with high information density and rhythmic control.

    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and varied syntax. One minor artifact: "a seed of chaos in her sterile world" slightly mixes metaphors (organic seed vs. clinical sterile), but it's a hairline slip that doesn't obscure clarity or harm the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density.

    Prose is generally lucid and evocative with strong rhythmic control, though it occasionally leans into slightly overworked metaphor ("the cloak of doubt she wore, a heavy, invisible mantle"). A minor paraphrase loop exists between "professional veneer" and "persona of a conscience for hire" in the first paragraph. The climax, however, is propelled by clear, concrete action and dialogue without obscuring the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is largely exquisite, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward poetic overwriting in the peak beat (e.g., "a human-shaped window into the dense starfield behind her"), which, while beautiful, momentarily softens the narrative's propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose exhibits exceptional clarity and concision with high information density. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with scene needs, accelerating during the climax. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats. Read-aloud rhythm is sophisticated and varied, with strong verbs and specific nouns throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. No loops or scaffold artifacts. The final paragraph's cadence shift beautifully supports the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and rhythmic variety. There are no loops, scaffolds, or figurative muddles. Every sentence advances atmosphere, character, or plot. The final paragraph is a masterclass in concision and resonant image-making.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, lyrical, and highly controlled, with strong rhythmic variation. Information density is high, with sentences performing multiple jobs. A minor register drift occurs with "wavelength aligned," which feels slightly technical for the POV's lexicon, but it is a consistent motif and does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.8)
    Exquisite line-level craft. Prose is dense, poetic, and propulsive, with every sentence advancing multiple jobs. Rhythm is masterfully controlled, varying to match emotional beats. Zero artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language is coherent, vivid, and perfectly integrated ("dusk bled," "lexicon of glittering stones"). A benchmark for lyrical precision.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.8)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. The prose is largely free of scaffolds and loops. A minor deduction for a hint of overwriting in the first paragraph ("lukewarm talent," "brittle devotion," "annealed" feel slightly synonymous on close read), but it does not harm clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is highly accomplished with strong information density and propulsion. A minor instance of synonym churn exists ("sacred, somber duty"), and the phrase "precisely humane economy" feels slightly over-determined, creating a minor register drift in an otherwise embodied opening.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and propulsive, with high information density. One minor artifact: the phrase "ancient freshness" is slightly contradictory, creating a small figurative muddle. Otherwise, sentences advance story and atmosphere with clarity and rhythmic control.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly efficient and propulsive, with excellent rhythm and variation. Information density is high, with sentences often doing double duty (e.g., "The watcher’s burden crystallized in that moment"). A minor scaffold phrase ("a product of attentively inventive problem-solving") and a near-paraphrase loop ("soundless echo" repeated) prevent a higher score, but clarity is never harmed.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm, vivid metaphors ("a wall you built to survive the fall"), and high information density. Sentence-level propulsion is excellent, accelerating with the emotional intensity. A single instance of potential synonym churn ("terrifying, exhilarating") prevents a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: a paraphrase loop ("storm-born silence... same storm-born silence") and a tendency toward slightly elevated diction in peak beats ("profound peace") that, while voice-consistent, slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly dense and propulsive, with sentences doing multiple jobs (e.g., "tears streamed down his face, instantly dried by the wind"). A minor artifact exists: the phrase "mournfully eager" in the first paragraph feels slightly label-like, though it is quickly dramatized. Otherwise, the writing is clean of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle, especially in the peak beats. The final line is a masterful image that recharges the motif of "tending."

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("time into syrup," "razor-thin lines"). Rhythm is varied and supports the contemplative tone. A minor paraphrase loop ("waiting potential"/"arrested decay") occurs but does not touch the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.1)
    Line-level craft is exemplary with high information density and rhythmic control. Sentences like "He poured into it not instruction, but invitation" do multiple jobs. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The prose accelerates and breathes perfectly with the scene's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally polished, with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences are varied and propel the narrative forward. Figurative language ("a reverse explosion, a gentle gathering") is precise and enhances clarity. The final line is a masterful, resonant image that recharges prior motifs without summary or moralizing.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with figurative language that enhances rather than obscures. Sentence-level rhythm varies effectively with scene needs. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting detected; the final paragraph's cadence is particularly masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=9.4)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language is precise and coherent, serving the atmosphere without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. Minor deduction for occasional complex sentences that, while beautiful, create a slight rhythmic drag in high-pressure beats, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful ("glass dome fractured and weeping"). No loops, scaffolding, or artifacts. Sentences propel the atmospheric and emotional momentum seamlessly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive with excellent rhythm and information density. One minor figurative artifact appears in the climax ("a pattern of information..."), creating a slight coherence muddle in an otherwise pristine peak beat. This prevents a 9+ score but does not significantly obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and controlled with excellent rhythmic variation. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the peak beat ("mask of static agony") which, while effective, slightly risks obscuring clarity. Otherwise, sentences are propulsive and dense, advancing story and character simultaneously. No loops, scaffolds, or register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, even in peak beats ("pulsating like a sick heart"). A single minor artifact: "jeering crowd" is a slightly conventional metaphor in an otherwise original passage.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.3)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without artifice, with high information density and varied sentence structures that accelerate toward closure. Figurative language ("frostbitten hope") is precise and pattern-taught. No loops, scaffold, or register drift; every line advances story or atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. Information density is excellent, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "the city’s mechanical core pulsed beneath his feet, a rhythmic, lifeless thrum"). A minor instance of potential register drift exists in the phrase "screamed, not with his voice, but with his soul," which leans slightly abstract in a high-pressure beat, but it does not significantly obscure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is exceptionally clean, with high information density and rhythmic control. There is no scaffold, loop, or figurative muddle. One minor instance of potential filter-verb stacking ("He was trying to foster her spirit") slightly dulls immediacy but is isolated and does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose exhibits high information density and clear propulsion, with figurative language that coheres and supports the climax. A minor rhythm flattening occurs in one beat ("Its voice was the creak..."), but it does not harm closure. Otherwise, zero loops, scaffold, or muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for slight artifacting in peak beats, such as "emotional geometries coalescing into potential plots," which leans slightly abstract. However, the language is largely precise and serves the accumulative drive.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is lush but controlled, with high information density and purposeful rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight template cadence in the opening description ("her life dictated by... her domain was... her purpose, she felt..."). However, the language remains clear and propulsive, especially in the climactic act of painting.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is dense and rhythmic, with high information density and no loops or artifacts. Figurative language like "a container for things too potent" is purposeful and coherent. Sentence-level propulsion varies naturally with the scene's needs, enhancing momentum without obscuring clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("surreal aquarium," "broken constellations") is purposeful and coherent. A single minor loop occurs in "The memory was of wonder, and love, and a secret passed down," which slightly paraphrases the preceding realization, costing a tenth.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and propulsive, with high information density. A single, minor artifact exists: the word "tessellation" introduces a slightly academic register that feels mildly out of step with the established voice in a high-pressure beat. This is a hairline slip that does not obscure closure but prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly vivid and purposeful, with strong rhythmic control. Minor artifact: a slight synonym churn ("radiant hush" followed by "shimmering mist" and "great white sound") creates a faint template cadence in the opening beats, but it does not obscure causality or dull the powerful closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.7)
    Line-level craft is exceptional, with high information density and rhythmic control. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or scaffold. Figurative language ("a woven tapestry of withheld breaths") is pattern-taught and pays off, serving the accumulative drive without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally clear and concise, with high information density and rhythmic variation that supports the contemplative tone. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. The opening and closing lines are perfectly anchored, and the final sentence achieves a powerful cadence shift that lands the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. One minor artifact: "agonizing slow motion" is a slight cliché in an otherwise original description of the globe's fall. The final paragraph is a masterclass in thematic demonstration through concrete image and action, with zero loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent rhythmic control that accelerates with the storm ("Her fingers flew across the console"). Information density is high, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A single, minor artifact: the phrase "driftingly alert" is slightly tell-y and repetitive, though it is quickly substantiated by the action of listening. No loops or muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Sentences often perform double duty, advancing both plot and atmosphere. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle. A minor deduction for a slightly convenient discovery mechanism, but it does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and vivid, precise imagery. A minor deduction for the slightly abstract phrase "driftwood nostalgia," which feels less concrete than the surrounding prose. Otherwise, the sentences are propulsive and devoid of loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "brambled hope" is a slightly strained metaphor that briefly calls attention to itself. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are excellent, with no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense and lyrical with high information density and clear propulsion. Minor rhythm issue: a near-paraphrase loop ("a final solace" / "a wave of peace") occurs but does not obscure closure. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated, supporting pressure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptional, with high information density, vivid sensory detail, and rhythmic control. Lines like "sound as offhandedly exact" and "graceless beauty" do multiple jobs. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle detected in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful metaphors ("discordant note," "guided path"). A minor instance of scaffold phrasing exists ("The method, an insight gained tracing river foam patterns, began to unfold in his mind"), which slightly delays the sentence's propulsion but does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly crafted with excellent rhythm and information density. Minor deduction for occasional dense metaphor clusters in high-pressure beats ("psychic full-body grind, sandpapering the sharp, painful facets"), though they remain legible and do not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control and information density. A minor deduction for a subtle template cadence in the description of the silos speaking ("soft, rhythmic creak... rumbled a reply... soft rustle") which slightly dulls the closure image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and propulsive, with strong information density. However, a minor figurative density artifact appears in the high-pressure beat describing the memory flood ("A child’s laughter... woven into the memory..."). The stacked metaphors, while effective, slightly slow the immediacy of this crucial moment, preventing a score in the 9+ band for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is dense and propulsive with high information density. Figurative language is pattern-taught and purposeful ("prism-minded," "latent blaze"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence-level rhythm varies effectively to match scene needs.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is generally strong with vivid imagery and good rhythm. A minor deduction for slight density in the final paragraph, where the thematic conclusion ("beauty was the move that healed the board") verges on abstraction, though it is earned by the scene. No loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid imagery. Information density is excellent, with sentences doing multiple jobs. A minor artifact: "timber" is likely a homophone error for "timbre." Figurative language is generally purposeful, though "sonic sigh of surrender" verges on mild ornamentation in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally strong with high information density and effective rhythm. A minor deduction for a slight thesaurus-churn feel in phrases like "olfactorily sensitive" and "journalized," which momentarily stand out from the otherwise organic and embodied description. The closure beat, however, is clear and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and clear propulsion. Figurative language ("petrified worms," "dancing stars") is precise and purposeful, enhancing rather than obscuring clarity. No loops, scaffold, or artifacting. Sentence-level rhythm is masterful.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is dense, purposeful, and highly atmospheric. However, minor artifacts prevent a higher score: the "woolen blanket" metaphor for silence is slightly cliché, and phrases like "disciplined" air verge on problematic personification. These are small blemishes on otherwise exceptional line-level craft that maintains strong momentum and clarity, especially in the crucial closure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly figurative but controlled and purposeful, with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor register drift occurs in "oscillating repose," which feels slightly academic for the POV's lexicon at the peak beat, but this is a hairline slip that does not harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and purposeful, with high information density and varied syntax. Figurative language ("avalanchingly quiet stillness") is pattern-taught and enhances clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally crafted with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for slight overwriting in the peak beat ("a cacophony of stolen laughs, appropriated rages, and adopted sorrows"); the synonym stack ("echoes without sources, masks with no faces") slightly dulls the immediacy of the closure image, though the sense remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is dense and evocative with high information density and strong rhythmic control. A single minor artifact exists: "a fading ache, a story slipping from memory to myth" is a slight paraphrase loop, but it does not obscure closure or causality.

    Prose is concise, vivid, and propulsive, with high information density ("a quiet act of azure defiance"). Rhythm varies naturally, and sentences advance multiple elements of story and atmosphere. A single minor artifact exists ("psychic assault" feels slightly register-drifted), but it does not harm closure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly specific with strong momentum. A minor template cadence appears in the first paragraph ("a cartographer... a cavernous... a symphony... a place") but does not harm closure. Figurative language is consistent and purposeful, supporting the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythmic control. A minor artifact: a slight filter-verb stack ("Elias could hear," "Elias felt") in the opening beats slightly dulls immediacy, preventing a higher score despite exceptional clarity and momentum elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally polished with high information density and zero artifacts. Sentences advance story, character, and atmosphere simultaneously, e.g., "his laugh a soft promise to the dark."

    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and vivid, purposeful imagery. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the first paragraph ("sanctuary of quiet," "raw nerve," "gravitational force") which, while effective, approaches a stacked effect. However, it does not obscure clarity or harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with strong rhythm and sensory specificity. Minor figurative density in peak beats ("uncloak the world like a silken sheet") slightly risks clarity but does not harm closure. No loops or scaffold; closure image remains sharp.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and vivid, purposeful imagery. However, a minor artifact exists: a cluster of complex metaphors in the climax ("weeping a single, slow tear," "first idea of sound") creates a slight drag on momentum and clarity at the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.7)
    Prose is pristine, with high information density and zero artifacts. Every sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere. Figurative language is precise and coherent (“a spectrum of chaotic light and raw terror”).

    Prose is polished and highly efficient, with strong rhythmic control and zero artifacts. Sentences are dense and propel the narrative forward ("The ensuing quiet felt heavy, charged."). Figurative language is precise and enhances clarity rather than obscuring it.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is lush and highly controlled, with excellent rhythm and sensory detail. However, a minor deduction is applied for a slight density issue in high-pressure beats (e.g., "a pattern of such profound emptiness it felt like a question"), where figurative language stacks without payoff, creating a moment of opacity that slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally clear and concise with high information density, doing multiple jobs of advancing plot, character, and atmosphere. Rhythm and syntax are varied and purposeful, accelerating and breathing with the scene's needs. There are no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle in the peak beats, only vivid, propulsive imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A slight tendency toward ornate description ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze") creates minor texture but does not obscure causality or closure. No loops or scaffolding artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is exceptionally vivid and concise with high information density. A minor deduction for the slightly repetitive phrasing "patiently nimble," but it does not harm closure. Rhythm and syntax expertly support the accumulative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythm and information density. A minor deduction for a slight tendency toward ornate description in a few phrases (e.g., "reed-blown melancholy"), which, while beautiful, slightly slows momentum. However, no loops, scaffold, or figurative muddle obscure the crucial closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is highly polished, vivid, and dense with purpose. The read-aloud rhythm is excellent. A minor deduction for slight figurative density in the opening paragraph ("whisperer to the dead," "steel graves," "cacophony of final regrets") which, while beautiful, borders on a pattern that is slightly more decorative than functional in that specific beat.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and lyrical, with varied rhythm and sentence structure. A minor artifact exists: "scintillatingly somber" is a highly wrought compound adjective that slightly strains for effect in an otherwise natural voice, though it is thematically justified.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is concise and propulsive, with high information density. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent ("tapestry of comfortable lies"). No loops, scaffold, or register drift. Sentence rhythm varies effectively, especially in the storm climax. Read-aloud test passes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. Figurative language ("sky was a pale, thin gruel") is consistent and voice-motivated. Minor artifact: "positively wistful" feels slightly diagnostic but is quickly dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is highly vivid and economical, with excellent rhythmic control and sensory specificity. A minor deduction for the peak-beat artifact "fleshly ethereal," which introduces a slight register drift and muddles an otherwise crystal-clear closure image. Otherwise, line-level craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.5)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero artifacts. Figurative language ("impatience was a living thing, a coiled spring") is character-motivated and purposeful. The final image is clear, vivid, and achieves closure without summary.

    Prose is generally clean, vivid, and propulsive. The sentence "She was a shadow-laced peacekeeper" is a strong opener. There is high information density, with lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., describing the store while advancing the plot). A slight tendency towards thesaurus-like words ("shadow-laced," "anomaly") creates minor artifacts, but clarity and momentum are maintained, especially in the crucial vintage store beat.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is exquisite, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, a minor artifact exists: the phrase "hyper-sensitivity to the world’s subtle textures" has a slight register drift into diagnostic language in a key early beat, creating a small scaffold. This is a hairline slip that does not touch the closure but prevents a higher score. Otherwise, the language is precise, vivid, and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Prose is dense, rhythmic, and highly polished, with sentences doing multiple jobs ("a deep, resonant groan vibrated through the deck plates, a sound of stressed metal and shattering permanence"). A minor artifact: the phrase "changelessly constant" is repeated, creating a slight synonym loop that slightly dulls the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose is highly polished with strong rhythmic control and information density. Minor deduction for a slight over-reliance on figurative language in a high-pressure beat ("roughest seas of anxiety," "spirit was straining, a note held for too long"), which creates a minor decorative flourish.

The final paragraph is a masterclass in concision and resonant closure.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.9)
    Line-level craft is exceptionally strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. A minor deduction for a potential register drift in the phrase "store wonder in the cellar of reason," which, while beautiful, slightly elevates diction beyond the POV's likely lexicon in a peak beat. However, this is a hairline slip that does not harm closure clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is exceptionally dense and propulsive, with high information density and zero scaffold or loops. Figurative language ("greedy eye," "whalebone reverie") is consistent, purposeful, and enhances clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.2)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and density; sentences advance multiple elements without padding. Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated ("restless euphony"). Minor scaffold exists in adjacent descriptive lines but does not harm closure or propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is generally clear and propulsive with high information density. However, a cluster of figurative language in the high-pressure beat describing the heart-chamber ("library of intricate spirals," "history of the world in the curves of calcium and time") creates a minor density artifact that slightly dulls immediacy without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=9.0)

Otherwise, sentences are clean, varied, and advance the story on multiple levels.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is vivid and propulsive with high information density. A slight figurative density appears in the climax ("tiny city of grooves," "tuning fork for the soul") but the pattern is taught and pays off, and clarity is maintained. No loops or scaffolding artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.0)
    Prose is highly concise and vivid, with excellent rhythm and information density. Sentences like "The withheld truth was not his—it was hers" do multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is largely exceptional with high information density and vivid, purposeful description. A minor artifact exists: the phrase "delicately robust" is applied to the lake in the final paragraph, feeling slightly applied rather than fully earned through prior description, creating a small register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense and vivid with high information density. A minor template cadence emerges in passages using "He [verbed]" constructions, and the phrase "reluctant metamorphosis" is a slight register drift in a peak beat, introducing a minor artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.1)
    Prose is highly polished with excellent rhythm and information density. A minor artifact occurs in the phrase "choking beauty," which is repeated and risks feeling slightly overwritten in its second use, creating a small loop that slightly dulls the peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is polished and economical, with multi-tasking lines that carry image, tone, and theme. Occasional elevated turns risk purple but remain legible and purposeful. No scaffold loops or mechanical cadence; sentences vary and propel. The closing paragraphs achieve clarity while sustaining lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line‑level craft is clean, with strong verbs and specific nouns; “oil,” “brass,” and “hum” carry weight. Minimal scaffolding and no confusing metaphors; repetition (“pause in a pendulum’s swing”) reads as intentional motif. A few abstractions (“ethically diligent covenant,” “incremental absolution”) edge toward purple but are balanced by tactile detail. Momentum is steady and free of loops.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line‑level craft is clean, with efficient sentences that carry image and action together. A few lush phrases flirt with purple, but rhythm and clarity hold, and there’s minimal redundancy. Syntax varies and momentum is maintained through the decoding sequence. The final line lands without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished, with purposeful syntax and high information density; images like “a perfect reflector for a mind dedicated to seeing what was not there” carry double duty. There’s slight echoing (“He would not write the probable future. He would write the true one.”) and some conceptual repetition. Figurative control stays mostly clean, avoiding purple saturation at the peak. Momentum remains intact through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, mood, action) with minimal scaffold; imagery is fresh (“ember alcove,” “breath of forgotten kings”).

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean, propulsive lines with vivid yet purposeful imagery; minimal scaffolding. Metaphor density is present but controlled, rarely tipping into purple. No notable loops or template cadence; information density is high. The final sentence lands cleanly and recharges earlier motifs without overstatement.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.6)
    High information density with polished imagery and few redundancies; metaphors are coherent and sensorial. A couple of elevated turns of phrase flirt with purple but remain disciplined and scene-serving. Syntax and paragraphing support momentum into the consecration and the charged denouement.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is dense but purposeful, with images that do multiple jobs (“water as conduit,” “silent supernova” reweighting the dome’s flaw and the ampoule).

Momentum holds through the technical passages with no paraphrase loops. The final image squares with earlier motifs without purple excess.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is polished, image‑dense, and mostly does multiple jobs per line; “saffron quiet” and “syntax of dreams” feel fresh. A few phrases flirt with purple, but clarity and propulsion hold, especially at turns (the brush’s warmth, the refracted light). Sentence variety and paragraph pacing support momentum. No loops or scaffolding that dull the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong, image‑dense prose with purposeful rhythm; sensory detail advances action. Minor repetition (“She would… She would…”) reads as intentional anaphora, not padding.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs—world, character, and mechanism—without padding, and the prose seldom loops. Figurative language is fresh and coherent, rarely overstacked during peak beats. A few intensifier echoes (“bleak exhilaration”) repeat, but they don’t dull the turn or clarity. Final images are crisp and cleanly sequenced.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentence‑level craft is confident: vivid, economical images do multiple jobs and propel momentum. Occasional lushness (“cathedral of peeling paint”) stays coherent and voice‑true, avoiding figurative muddle. No loops or scaffold drag; cadence varies. Minor density in metaphor keeps it shy of the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line‑level craft is strong: precise images, purposeful verbs, and multi‑tasking sentences that carry action and atmosphere. A few stacked abstractions (“fractal generating core,” “restless euphony”) brush purple but do not blur causality. Momentum holds through the storm with clean sequencing and varied rhythm. Final line recharges prior motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs with clean propulsion; imagery is fresh and unforced. Minimal scaffolding, no looped paraphrase, and metaphors cohere with the world’s logic. Elevated diction fits the voice and never muddies causality. The final line lands crisply without purple overreach.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sentences are clear and purposeful with good rhythm; images often do double duty for tone and theme. Occasional clichés (“cathedral of neglect,” “ashes of its long burial”) and overt abstractions slightly blunt freshness. Minimal redundancy and clean mechanics keep momentum. The final image is crisp and unencumbered.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line craft is strong: sentences carry multiple jobs (image, mood, intent) and maintain momentum. A few metaphor stacks flirt with purple, but most are apt (“skeletal stone ribs,” “archive of sighs”). No visible loops or scaffold, and syntax varies to suit pressure. Clarity holds at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, action, interiority) with good rhythm and minimal scaffold. A few ornate phrasings risk purple but remain coherent and purposeful. No loops or mixed metaphors blunt the closure; information density is high without drag. Line‑level control supports propulsion through the investigative beats.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line-level craft is polished, with strong verbs and concrete images; sentences carry multiple jobs. A few heightened phrases flirt with purple (“shattering sorrow gilded”) but remain coherent and purposeful. No visible loops or scaffold; momentum holds through the transformation sequence. The final line resolves by image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Sentences carry momentum with purposeful variation; most lines do double duty (world + psyche). Figurative density is high but coherent to the motif; few, if any, paraphrase loops. Occasional elevated phrasing (“intangibly tangible”) risks purplish hue but remains thematically keyed and clear. Final beats land cleanly without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is strong with high information density and clean sequencing. Some heightened phrases flirt with purple, but most metaphors are coherent and purposeful. Minimal redundancy and good syntactic variety. The prose accelerates at key beats (activation, alignment) and breathes at the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.3)
    Lines are lean enough to move while carrying layered images; syntax varies and avoids loops. Figurative language is mostly clean and purposeful; no mixed metaphors that blur sense. Occasional abstract phrasing (“processed and intentional” silence) brushes purple but doesn’t slow momentum. Final image is crisp and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lines are clean, image‑rich, and efficient; sentences do multiple jobs without obvious scaffold. Occasional repetition (“furrowed hush,” doubled “mist”) reads intentional rather than redundant. Figurative texture stays coherent; no mixed metaphors or cadence templates bog momentum. Minor abstraction in the thematic sentence slightly blunts edge but does not undermine clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs—image, action, interiority—keeping momentum. Minor repetition (“backlash of regrets,” the coined “merrily melancholic”) skirts redundancy but reinforces motif rather than clogging. Figurative language is measured and consistent; no mixed metaphors or purple drifts that blur sense. The final lines land with crisp, image-driven clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.2)
    Line-level craft is polished with high information density and clean rhythm; images often do double duty. Some diction leans purple (“delicately robust,” “ancient regret”), but clarity holds and metaphors remain coherent. No evident scaffold loops or cadence templates. The final image lands cleanly without syntactic fog.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.5)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs (setting, motif, and action) with minimal scaffold. Figurative language is lush but coherent; olfactory images unify rather than clutter. Minor tell‑phrases appear but don’t stall momentum. The final image is clear and earned without purple overrun.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs (world, emotion, theme) without clutter, and the cadence breathes with the scene. Figurative language is lush yet coherent; minimal redundancy and no scaffolding loops. Occasional intensifiers (“choking beauty,” “sea of silver vapor”) verge on excess but don’t blur causality or closure. Line‑level craft largely supports propulsion and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry weight with minimal redundancy; imagery (sea of time, tear distorting space) is coherent and well‑placed. Figurative density supports rather than clogs momentum. No notable loop or scaffold artifacts, and cadence varies effectively. One or two elevated phrases brush purple but don’t blur sense.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.4)
    Line-level craft is controlled and lean for this mode; imagery multiplies meaning rather than diffusing it. Repetitions (“whispering hush”) feel motif-driven, not redundant, and prose avoids filter stacks. Sentences vary in length and cadence to maintain momentum through a quiet arc. No notable mixed metaphors or clarity slips.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.3)
    Line craft is tight with strong verbs and layered images doing multiple jobs. A few lush phrases (“obsidian monolith,” “cradle of sparks”) flirt with purple but remain coherent and in-tone. No scaffold loops or cadence templates slow momentum. The final image reprises motifs cleanly without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sentences carry multiple jobs with few redundancies; images are fresh and disciplined (“energy hit him not as a force, but as a concept”). Momentum holds through description, and syntax varies to match pacing. A few lush turns flirt with purple but do not blur clarity or causality. Final lines land cleanly without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is precise and multi-functional, with strong verbs and purposeful imagery tied to action. Minimal redundancy and clean momentum through the technical sequence of development.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lines are clean, with varied syntax and purposeful imagery; most sentences do more than one job. Occasional purple phrasing appears but doesn’t blur sense or momentum. No significant loops or scaffolding. The final sentences land with clarity and cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.5)
    Line‑level craft is clean and propulsive with high information density; images do double duty (moonlight as exposure/benediction). Figurative texture is rich without muddle; repetition motifs (flower, rebuild, fracture) are controlled and purposeful. Minor elevated phrasing at the end skirts sentimentality but stays earned by the scene work. No noticeable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prose is polished with high information density and varied cadence; images are fresh and coherent (“eddies of light,” “percussive knock”). No paraphrase loops or template cadence dominate. Figurative language increases at turns but remains controlled; no mixed metaphors blur sense. The closing line is clean and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    Prose is precise, image-rich, and mostly free of redundancy or purple stacks; lines carry multiple jobs efficiently. Phrases like “bruised purple” and “deafening curtain” skirt familiarity but are redeemed by fresh specifics (liquid shimmer, pulse through roots). Momentum holds without scaffold or loops. Syntax varies cleanly and the final line lands by image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.5)
    Prose is controlled, image‑dense, and mostly multi‑tasking; color and maritime lexicon unify sound and sense. Figurative language remains coherent (tides, drift, lace), avoiding mixed metaphors in peak beats. Minimal scaffolding and clean syntax keep momentum. Slight lushness risks purple but stays disciplined.


== Grader: Gemini 2.5 Pro ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, with almost every sentence serving multiple functions. Figurative language is purposeful and integrated, centered on the powerful wing-as-cosmos metaphor. The read-aloud quality is excellent. A minor deduction is made for the concluding paragraphs, which employ a slightly more summary-based mode ("Her grand narrative of tragedy decayed...") where a more purely perceptual embodiment could have been even stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There are moments of high craft, such as "a slow, patient archaeology of her own near-ruin." However, there are also minor but noticeable prose artifacts, including a template cadence in the final paragraph ("She would use... She would use... She would broadcast...") that feels slightly mechanical. Some phrases border on the abstract, slightly dulling the immediacy of the otherwise concrete narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in every sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative, such as the Collapse being an "implosion of sound" or frost blooming into "fractal gardens." There are no loops, scaffolding, or overwrought figurative language; the craft is clean, confident, and serves the story’s atmosphere and momentum perfectly from the first line to the last.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.7)
    The prose is generally clear, rhythmic, and often lyrical, especially in its descriptions of the underwater world. However, momentum is occasionally slowed by mild overwriting and a few instances of redundant phrasing. The repetition of general descriptors like "grand" and "great" slightly dulls the specificity, and the final paragraph leans on summary ("Silas had done it") rather than allowing the final image to carry the full weight of the conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening paragraph. Word choice is precise and evocative ("sun bled into the valleys," "a thread stitching the exiles together"). The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or overwriting, and its rhythm is controlled and purposeful, accelerating slightly with the discovery and then slowing for the weighted final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. A few minor instances of telling over showing ("a profound and urgent need," "utter clarity") and a slightly clichéd metaphor ("a bell struck in a hollow space") slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. These are minor and do not impact the momentum of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly effective. Sentences like "The world did not break, but it unbent" demonstrate a high level of craft and precision. The language is dense with meaning without feeling overwritten, and the rhythm modulates well with the story's pacing. There are one or two phrases that lean slightly into abstraction ("disintegrate the knot of corrupted time"), but overall, the line-level execution is superb and free of artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative descriptions. There are, however, a few instances of telling over showing, particularly in moments of thematic summary ("his current purpose was its purest expression: to plant resilience in dry soil"). These moments, while brief, slightly reduce momentum by abstracting what is otherwise a very concrete and immediate narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. The figurative language is precise and purposeful, particularly the climactic description of the blue note shattering into "irreparable shards of desolate, silent white." While the style verges on baroque, it remains controlled and clear, with no loops or scaffolding, creating a propulsive and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and vivid imagery. The rhythm and sentence structure are varied and controlled, propelling the narrative forward effectively. Minor deductions are for moments of slight overwriting, such as "a new, breathtaking substance: pure, illuminated moments," and small redundancies like "captured and captive," which momentarily break the otherwise seamless flow.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often lyrical and precise, with strong imagery like the ice shattering in a "cascade of diamonds." Yet, it is held back by several instances of cliché ("sharp as a shard," "weighty lightness") and overwriting that tell rather than show ("a profound unburdening"). These moments, combined with the jarring foreign-language artifact, create a textural inconsistency that requires a final polishing pass.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is largely clean, vivid, and propulsive, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. The story avoids major line-level artifacts like loops or overwritten descriptions. The score is held back because the direct thematic statements, particularly in the opening and closing, read more like scaffolding than fully integrated prose, momentarily disrupting the narrative momentum and texture.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with powerful imagery. However, there are moments of slight conceptual redundancy, as when "retell the stillness" is immediately followed by "This act of retelling was not mere transcription; it was interpretation." This minor tendency to explain its own metaphors slightly undercuts the otherwise impeccable flow. The language is consistently beautiful, but a stricter economy in a few key places would have made it flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density. However, a single typo—"Unit 704" instead of "Unit 734"—is a distracting copyediting flaw in an otherwise polished piece. Additionally, the opening sentence has a minor redundancy ("Its designation was Janitor, but it was a sentient robot janitor"). These are small but notable slips in an exceptionally strong piece, preventing a score in the 9+ band for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong imagery and a consistent rhythm. There are, however, minor instances of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly too dense or phrases feel pre-packaged ("a perfect metaphor for truth itself," "a weapon that could shatter a retired man’s reputation"). These moments slightly diffuse the otherwise sharp momentum, particularly near the otherwise strong climax.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with evocative, precise language ("gleamed like silver veins," "a blooming withering"). The rhythm is controlled, slowing for reflection and tightening during the confrontation. A minor weakness is a slight tendency towards abstract summary in key phrases like "commemorating small victories elaborately," which, while thematically resonant, momentarily pulls back from the otherwise concrete and embodied prose.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, precise, and highly evocative without being overwritten. Word choice is excellent ("eddies," "churr," "iridescent"), and sentence structure is varied to control pacing, particularly in the escalating tension of the climax. The piece demonstrates high information density and rhythmic control, with no discernible loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles to distract from its clear, propulsive momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and clear imagery. However, there are minor line-level issues that prevent a higher score. The word "profound" is repeated, and a few key moments rely on summary where dramatization would be stronger, such as "the message had been delivered and received." These moments slightly slow the momentum and reduce the immediacy of an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with vivid, precise imagery ("a blurred and smudged charcoal sketch," "a ghost in the machine"). Sentence structure is varied and the rhythm is controlled. A single, minor grammatical error ("He smudge the edge") is the only flaw; while small, it prevents a higher score for a piece aiming for flawless execution at this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and highly atmospheric, with strong verbs and precise imagery. However, a few moments rely on slightly familiar phrasing or telling, such as "a wave of drowsy alertness washed over her" and "snapped into painful clarity." These instances, while minor, momentarily reduce the immediacy in an otherwise immersive piece. The final sentence, while thematically sound, leans on a slightly common metaphor ("metallic taste of a truth").

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density and strong rhythm. Sentences like "her heart a placid lake" and "a tranquility forever on the verge of collapse" are particularly effective. Minor instances of near-overwriting ("blinding, raw light...screaming into the delicate ecosystem") and a slight paraphrase loop in the opening paragraph ("Her duty...This was her purpose") are the only small blemishes on an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is often luminous and precise, but it occasionally dips into adjectival density that feels slightly overwritten ("fragile, real smile"). The final paragraph's move to summarize the thematic outcome is a minor structural flaw, a form of scaffolding that tells the reader what has just been dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and purposeful. The opening sentence sets a high bar that the rest of the piece consistently meets. Word choice is precise and evocative ("vellum," "reverberations," "cataclysm"), and the figurative language is consistently effective, particularly "an archeologist of cataclysm" and the "autopsy" metaphor. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and atmospheric density.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with a strong opening and evocative imagery throughout. However, the story repeats its core thematic statements almost verbatim ("by directing flow," "conductor, not a puppet master"). This repetition functions like authorial scaffolding, explicitly stating the theme rather than allowing it to remain fully emergent, a minor but distinct flaw for this level of publication.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise. However, the grammatically incorrect phrase "decorates with silence," which appears twice, is a significant flaw. While it may be an intentional echo of a constraint, its awkwardness breaks the story's high-register voice and reads as a distracting artifact, preventing the prose from achieving the flawless quality required for the highest scores.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly musical, with varied sentence structures that mirror the story's rhythm—from long, flowing descriptions to the short, sharp finality of the climax's end. Word choice is consistently strong and evocative ("obsidian clarity," "vertiginous chamber"). The line-level craft is nearly flawless, creating a dense, immersive experience with no wasted words or momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, precise, and highly evocative, with many brilliant phrases. The piece is held back from the highest tier only by a minor, repetitive sentence structure in the middle section ("He stepped... He pushed... He walked..."). While arguably rhythmic, this faint template cadence is a small crack in an otherwise flawless surface.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, concise, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and purposeful metaphors. The rhythm is well-paced and sentences are crafted with care. The only weakness is a tendency to tell rather than show the peak emotional moments, summarizing the internal victory ("Inara felt a victory so complete it was dizzying") instead of fully grounding it in the physical sensations of that final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally strong, with good rhythm and concision. However, a few moments rely on telling rather than showing, which slightly dulls the momentum. Phrases like "Her credibly curious nature overrode her unease" and "began to intuit the horrifying truth" function as narrative scaffolding, summarizing a process that could have been more embodied. These minor artifacts prevent an otherwise excellent piece from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. However, the final two paragraphs contain a few prose artifacts. A paraphrase loop occurs where the narrative explains the meaning of Silas's tears twice in slightly different ways, momentarily slowing the powerful emotional cadence of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, but a few abstract phrases slightly mar its texture. Formulations like "ethically playful nudge" and "passionate subtlety radiated" feel less grounded and specific than the surrounding descriptions. These are minor dissonances in an otherwise strong piece, but in a story aiming for flawless execution, they stand out and prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythmic sense. However, a few moments lean on slightly familiar imagery ("blackened ribs of some leviathan") or abstract descriptors ("magnificent simplicity") that feel less specific than the rest of the piece. While these are minor slips, they prevent the prose from reaching flawless execution, particularly in the story's second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, precise, and highly efficient, with exceptional information density in every line. Figurative language is both beautiful and functional, as when an emotion tastes of "metal and algebra." The rhythm is controlled, shifting from the clinical language of the lab to the more lyrical, sensory prose of the grotto, perfectly matching the story's beats. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; it is a pristine piece of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, with a graceful rhythm and vivid sensory details that build a strong atmosphere. However, the final paragraph contains redundant phrasing that weakens the story's powerful closing image. Sentences summarizing the meaning of the events ("That misaddressed envelope had not been a error, but an opportunity") are unnecessary scaffolding. This narrative telling after the dramatic showing dulls the impact of the final beat by explaining what was already felt.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, demonstrating strong command of rhythm and syntax. Lines like “an archeologist of spirit” are superb. There are, however, minor instances of slight imprecision or redundancy that could be tightened for maximum impact, such as “ached with a familiar, luminescent ache.” Similarly, “a silence of profound understanding” is functional but less fresh than the surrounding prose. These are hairline issues in an otherwise polished piece, but they prevent a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and economical, with high information density in every line. Sentences like "The city of Aevum was built in the cascading silence between one moment and the next" establish world and tone simultaneously. The language is precise and evocative without ever feeling overwritten, and the rhythm of the prose propels the narrative forward with a grace that matches the story's central concept.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with powerful and precise imagery ("formulae that hung like gossamer"). However, a few key moments of insight are articulated in slightly declarative, thematic statements that could be more fully embodied. For instance, "The mathematics was not in the loss itself, but in the living with it" borders on telling, where the preceding imagery had already shown this. A final polish to further integrate these insights into perception rather than summary would elevate the line-level craft from excellent to flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless. Word choice is precise and evocative, with strong verbs and concrete imagery carrying the narrative. There is a very minor tendency towards over-writing in a few descriptive phrases ("kindly methodical patience," "quiet ache she carried always"), which slightly polishes the grit off the character's experience. However, the momentum is excellent, the rhythm is controlled, and the overall craft is of a publishable standard.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. Word choice is precise and evocative ("relentless percussion," "dark bruise against the grey sky"). There is a minor, recurring prose artifact in the form of conceptually dense, authorial-sounding phrases like "circuitously sincere" and "precise innocence," which feel slightly imposed on the character's perception rather than emerging from it, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly polished. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative (e.g., "navigational" rain, "a tiny, dense archive of perseverance"). Sentences are rhythmically varied and carry momentum without a single wasted word or clunky construction. The piece demonstrates exceptional line-level craft, with zero distracting artifacts, loops, or overwriting, even in its most descriptive passages.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with striking imagery and strong verbs. However, momentum is significantly hampered at the peak of the crisis by a block of exposition explaining *why* Elara's clairvoyance failed. This moment of telling, rather than showing through panicked inference, breaks the tension and reads like authorial scaffolding left in the text.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there are minor instances of scaffolding where the story tells the reader a character trait directly instead of letting it emerge purely from action (e.g., "But Elara was reactively visionary"). This slightly undermines the otherwise high-quality line-level craft by momentarily explaining rather than dramatizing.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the first half. The rhythm and syntax support the story's mysterious, deliberate momentum. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraph, which feels slightly less sharp and more summary-based than the preceding prose, preventing a higher score, but the overall craft is of publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and maintains a consistent, elevated tone with good rhythmic variety. However, key moments rely on abstract, conceptual language ("sculpting a space for them to hear their own profound kindness made manifest") where more concrete, sensory detail would provide a stronger visceral payoff. The climax describes the idea of the action more than the experience of it.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and highly polished, marked by strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally tips into overwriting, with a very high density of figurative language that can feel slightly labored ("a hushed thunder promising imminent fracture," "a spatial mutiny, a rebellion of coordinate and vector"). While the rhythm and momentum are excellent overall, a few moments of syntactic repetition and near-paraphrasing prevent it from reaching the highest tier of flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and purposeful, with high information density in its descriptions ("a deathly vitality that hummed under the fluorescent lights"). The rhythm is controlled, reflecting Elara's initial rigidity and later emotional shift. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward summarizing the emotional arc in the final paragraph, particularly the last sentence which feels more like a thematic statement than an embodied conclusion, slightly dulling the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, precise word choice, and a controlled, elegant rhythm. The prose builds atmosphere and character simultaneously. A slight hesitation on a perfect score comes from a few moments of analytical summary, such as "These were not hallucinations; they were textures," which slightly pulls back from full immersion to explain the experience.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to match the story's mood, moving from meditative description to tense discovery without a single wasted word. Figurative language, such as the "tapestry of absence" and the "rust-canaled paths," is fresh and integral to the story's world. There are no notable loops, scaffolds, or other prose artifacts; the craft is clean and highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and confident, marked by high information density and precise, evocative language ("ghosts of astronomy," "resonate directly within her bones"). There are no wasted words or movements; every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The rhythm is controlled, building tension quietly toward the climax and settling into a somber, purposeful cadence at the close.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the story's momentum from reflection to action. There are no technical errors or clumsy constructions. A very minor deduction is made for a slight tendency towards abstract, writerly phrasing ("potent, humming mix of hopeful desperation") that, while effective, occasionally pulls away from purely concrete embodiment.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery that carries the story's emotional weight effectively. Lines like "The click was absorbed by the total vacuum" demonstrate masterful concision. The score is slightly tempered by the opening paragraph, which contains minor scaffolding ("Her attribute was...", "Her motivation... was...") that tells the reader what the rest of the story shows more gracefully.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and evocative sensory details. Momentum is well-maintained, and the information density is high. The score is slightly tempered by a few instances of overwriting, such as "relentless, patient grace, her movements a silent dance," which feel more ornamental than functional and briefly thin the story's grounded texture.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished to a high sheen, demonstrating both elegance and economy. Sentences are dense with meaning and imagery, propelling the narrative forward while simultaneously building atmosphere. Word choices like "freeze-dried water" and "a fleeting cartography of breath and ice" are both precise and poetic, showcasing a line-level craft that is consistently excellent and free of any distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is evocative and polished, but it occasionally verges on being overwritten due to the high density of figurative language in nearly every sentence. While many images are strong ("skeletal buildings whose windows were eyes vacant of sight"), their sheer frequency can slightly blunt their individual impact. There are also minor repetitive sentence structures, such as "This was her method..." followed by "This was the work," that create a somewhat mechanical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean and demonstrates strong command, particularly in its atmospheric descriptions. Momentum is well-maintained, and the syntax is varied. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward abstraction and redundancy, such as defining the silence in one clause and then describing it metaphorically in the next, or using abstract jargon like "nexus of instinct." These moments slightly diffuse the otherwise sharp and immersive imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There is, however, a slight tendency toward abstraction in key moments, particularly the opening sentence ("a necessity that sustained impossibilities"), which is dense and less immediate than the rest of the piece. While this doesn't derail the narrative, it slightly dulls the initial impact before the story finds its concrete footing.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is exquisite, marked by powerful imagery and a confident, varied rhythm. However, the prose occasionally risks becoming over-freighted with its own lyricism. A minor paraphrase loop occurs when "lovingly venomous" is immediately explained by "a caress that stung," slightly diluting the power of the initial oxymoron. This is a small friction point in an otherwise impeccably polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its imagery ("bone-white moon," "pearlescent light"). However, a few moments lean on direct statement of intent or realization, such as "Thea, the poetic weaver, understood her task was not to follow but to alter." While the subsequent actions show this, the explicit declaration is a minor scaffold that slightly tempers an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptions of the orchard. Sentences are well-constructed and the rhythm supports the story's contemplative pace. The primary flaw is the tendency toward direct thematic explanation in the final paragraph, a move from showing to telling that slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise strong and imagistic conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often beautiful, with high information density in phrases like "a ritual anachronism" and "building a soul from colored dust." There are no significant prose artifacts or loops. The score is held back slightly by the final two paragraphs, where the syntax becomes more declarative and summative, losing some of the evocative propulsion that characterizes the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with a strong, consistent rhythm that matches the protagonist's deliberate nature. Word choice is excellent, creating vivid imagery without becoming overwrought ("the kind that precedes a great upheaval," "a tangled knot"). A minor paraphrase loop exists in the first paragraph ("decorative... foolish obsession" followed by "disguising... mere foolishness"), which is a hairline flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and demonstrates high information density. Lines like "read the history in a discarded button or the sorrow in a cracked teacup" do immense work in a short space. While the overall quality is very high, there are minor instances of syntactic parallelism that feel slightly heavy-handed, such as "she wrote intention, she wrote memory, she wrote longing." These moments briefly break the otherwise seamless and evocative flow but do not harm the story's momentum or clarity at its core.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, exhibiting high information density and rhythmic control. Phrasing like "a slow, cold tide," "a lotus-hearted ache," and "a scream given form" is evocative without being overwrought. The sentences are varied and propelled by strong verbs, and the authorial hand is invisible. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold phrases; every line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or the causal chain of the plot with startling efficiency.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative, well-chosen imagery ("skeletal, fog-shrouded trees," "spectral fruit that shimmered with internal radiance"). The prose maintains momentum and demonstrates high information density, weaving description, action, and interiority together seamlessly. The rhythm of the sentences is varied and controlled, contributing significantly to the story's atmospheric and emotional impact. It is clean, polished, and free of distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely immaculate, with evocative and precise language ("powdered ghosts of forgotten pigments"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's sense of wonder and methodical discovery. Minor moments of telling ("This, she realized, was the method...") are the only slight blemishes in an otherwise pristine execution, preventing a higher score but not detracting from the story's propulsive clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Word choice is precise and evocative, establishing the world and its rules with efficiency ("cognitive meters," "candidly cryptic"). There are no discernible loops or scaffolding; every sentence serves to advance the narrative, build atmosphere, or deepen character, culminating in a clean, propulsive climax.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong, evocative imagery. Figurative language is ambitious and mostly successful, creating a rich texture without obscuring meaning or momentum. There are no distracting line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding. The sentence and paragraph rhythms are varied and purposeful, serving the story's quiet, profound mood.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with a strong, varied rhythm. Each sentence works to advance the story's atmosphere or plot, achieving propulsion through precise, evocative language. The piece avoids major artifacts, but a few instances of common phrasing ("urgency clawing at her throat") slightly soften the otherwise unique texture. While the figurative language is ambitious and mostly successful, these minor conventionalities prevent it from reaching the highest tier of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, with very few wasted words. A couple of phrases, like "heart hammered against her ribs," touch on cliché, which slightly holds it back from the highest tier. However, there are no structural prose artifacts, loops, or momentum-draining sentences, making for a polished and professional piece of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and dense with purpose. However, a few moments rely on familiar phrasing that slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution. Phrases like "threatened to tear her in two" and the trope of a "single tear track[ing] through the grime" are minor blemishes on an otherwise polished piece, preventing a score in the 9s.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and meticulously controlled. Sentence structure and rhythm vary to match the story's pacing, from the slow deliberation of the balancing act to the rising tension of the climax. Figurative language is consistently fresh and purposeful, serving to deepen character and atmosphere rather than merely decorate. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts to disrupt its momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. However, the line "shimmered with 潜在 energy" introduces a jarring, unexplained element (a Chinese word/pinyin) that reads as a conspicuous artifact rather than a motivated stylistic choice, briefly disrupting the otherwise immersive texture. While the rest of the line-level craft is strong, this unassimilated detail is a notable flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. While exceptionally strong overall, a few minor phrases like "softly ingenious focus" or "shadowseam wonder" feel slightly asserted rather than purely emergent from the scene. These are hairline issues that do not disrupt momentum or the clarity of the powerful closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.7)
    The line-level craft is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and specific, sensory imagery. The prose maintains momentum and clarity, skillfully balancing descriptive passages with narrative progression. A few moments lean slightly towards telling over showing, such as the line "The idea arrived...as a full-blown conjecture," which summarizes the cognitive leap. However, these instances are minor and do not significantly detract from the overall high quality of the writing.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with high information density. The rhythm and syntax support the story's focused, deliberate pace. The final paragraph contains minor scaffolding, where sentences like "He had ordered randomness and in doing so, had created a genuine moment of wonder" summarize an effect that the preceding scene already powerfully demonstrated, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp ending.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and dense with vivid imagery. However, it walks a fine line with overwriting, and the consistently high register lacks dynamic range, which can feel slightly monotonous. A few phrases, like "Her entire being spontaneously anchored," feel a touch less polished than the surrounding text. While the lushness is largely purposeful and effective, a bit more restraint or rhythmic variation in key moments would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and propelled by strong, specific verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are constructed with a glazier's precision, creating a rhythm that mirrors the story's emotional arc. The piece avoids nearly all prose artifacts; while a phrase like "noctilucent reckoning" verges on being overwrought, it lands within the established elevated tone and doesn't detract from the story's potent clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely free of artifacts. Imagery is specific and potent, such as the "spider-veined fissure that split a painted rose in two." The sentence structure varies to control rhythm, moving from descriptive passages to the more incantatory reflection ("He thought of... He thought of..."). While a phrase like "hard softness" risks abstraction, it is immediately grounded, earning its place. The overall effect is a clean, resonant, and highly polished piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and ambitious, with high information density. However, a few key moments lean on abstract, declarative statements rather than embodied perception, such as "a silent chord struck deep within the structure of reality." While stylistically consistent, these instances slightly blunt the immediacy of the breakthrough, preventing the prose from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally clean and evocative, but the final paragraph shifts into summary. Phrasing like "She gave them the glimpse of the precise failure" is a prose artifact that tells the reader the event's significance instead of letting the dramatized action carry the weight, dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and precise, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm and word choice are consistently strong. A few minor constructions lean toward stating an emotional state ("not an absence of feeling, but...") rather than purely embodying it, a hairline flaw in an otherwise impeccable execution.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious and often lands with elegance, establishing a dignified tone. However, it is held back by a tendency toward overwriting, with redundancies like "slow, ponderous dance" and "stately waltz" appearing close together. There are also moments where figurative language becomes slightly ornate ("time itself feel thick and syrupy"), which slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished, confident, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery that drive the story forward. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, accelerating effectively as the storm breaks. While some phrases lean slightly towards the ornate ("a perfect ossified tear," "solitary, silent reverberation"), this is largely consistent with the character's voice and avoids becoming a significant flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with strong verbs and high information density. While the density of figurative language is consistently high ("woven from solidified starlight," "suspended between sigh and smile"), it largely serves the lyrical tone without obscuring clarity. A slight deduction is made for this sustained intensity, which borders on overwriting but ultimately succeeds in creating its intended effect.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery like "meteor hush" and "ink as black as the void between stars." However, a few moments lean toward telling over showing. The line describing the epiphany as a "slow, creeping realization" and the final sentence, "it was her finest work," function as summary where the dramatized action was already sufficient, slightly dulling the final image's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density and precise word choice. The line-level craft successfully builds the story's quiet, profound atmosphere without significant overwriting. While phrases like "blushing stillness" are repeated intentionally for effect, and "felt like held breath" is a minor cliché, the overall execution is clean, rhythmic, and free of distracting artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. The sentence-level craft is generally superb. A minor weakness is a tendency to explain what has just been shown, as in "The rope had not been ceremonial; it was a tool, a lens for focusing memory," which slightly deflates the discovery by summarizing its function for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, dense, and often lyrical, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("circuits like frozen lace"). The rhythm is well-paced, accelerating with the arrival of the storm. A minor, recurring tic is the use of adjective triplets ("beautiful, terrible, and unpredictable"; "chaotic, lovely, and defiant"), which feels slightly patterned and momentarily breaks the otherwise organic flow of the prose.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly efficient, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. Information density is high, particularly in the opening paragraphs that establish character and setting. A single phrase, "empirically ironic," feels slightly self-conscious and breaks the otherwise seamless texture of the prose. This is a very minor flaw in an otherwise polished piece, but it prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in its descriptions (e.g., "a place where noise went to be unmade"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's grave, quiet atmosphere without becoming monotonous. The language of the climax is particularly effective, rendering an abstract event in concrete, sensory terms: "a tone pulled from the past, from the archive of his own flesh."

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures that create a compelling narrative momentum. The writing is almost flawless, but the final paragraph leans slightly into summary ("She had not measured it, nor seized it. She had simply breathed it into coexistence..."). While this clarifies the conceptual shift, a more purely imagistic conclusion would have been even more powerful and trusted the reader more.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density, especially in the opening description of the setting. Sentence structure varies effectively to control rhythm and momentum. There are no significant prose artifacts, though a few descriptive phrases like "endearingly feisty" are slightly generic labels in an otherwise highly specific and concrete narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density. The sentence structure varies effectively to control pace, especially in the transition into the vision. There's a minor paraphrase loop ("The story was not over; the lineage was not dead.") and a few instances of abstract emotional description that could be more concrete, which slightly tempers the otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, with lines like "a geography of ink and vellum" and "a syntax of silence" doing immense work. The language is precise and evocative without becoming overwrought, even in its most fantastic moments. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence serves to build tension, character, or the central concept with remarkable clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished and highly evocative, with strong verbs and striking imagery. Sentences are crafted with care, creating a compelling rhythm. A few minor instances of near-redundancy slightly reduce the otherwise high information density (e.g., "singular, a compulsion"), but these are fleeting and do not impact the momentum or the clarity of the powerful closure scene.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and propulsive, with high information density in each sentence. Phrases like "a silent, potent wrongness" achieve a great deal with economy. The line "translating the visual language of the seal into a tactile, topological truth" is slightly overwrought but serves the climax well. There are no significant prose artifacts or momentum-dulling loops.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and highly figurative, with memorable phrases like "bloom of hush." At times, however, it leans on dense clusters of adjectives ("formless, vibrant presences," "tense, metallic stillness") that, while evocative, create a slightly overwrought texture and momentarily slow the narrative rhythm. The piece is free of major artifacts, but a more varied syntactic approach would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, resonant imagery like "a shard of hush so complete it felt solid." There are no significant prose artifacts, loops, or overwriting. A few early sentences lean slightly more towards telling than showing ("It was a lonely gift..."), but this is a minor issue in a piece with otherwise stellar line-level craft and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with a strong, rhythmic cadence. Sentences are crafted with precision, and figurative language like "preemptive nostalgia" and "data-rich shadow" is both beautiful and functional. The purposeful repetition of "a deepening hush" effectively marks the narrative's progression towards its silent, final state. While the language is consistently elevated, it avoids becoming overwrought, maintaining clarity and momentum through to the poignant final line.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences like "he was stitching the sky back together" demonstrate high-level craft. There are one or two instances of adjacent sentences that restate a core idea for rhetorical emphasis (e.g., "His craft was his rebellion"), a very minor tic that a demanding editor might streamline, but overall the line-level execution is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. Sentences like "each ripple a tiny clock ticking" demonstrate high craft. A slight deduction is made for a few moments of over-determined figurative language ("a key waiting for a lock") and a small instance of thematic summary that slightly reduces the overall information density in a key beat.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with high information density and strong imagery like the bunker as a "slowly collapsing lung." A few phrases, such as "intangibly tangible" and "synapse of pure beauty," slip into abstraction where a more concrete, embodied description would have been stronger, holding it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with high information density in most lines. However, a few moments slip into slight over-explanation, telling the reader the significance of an action rather than letting the effect stand on its own (e.g., "This action would catalyze the change she willed upon the world"). This minor scaffolding prevents a higher score, but the overall craft, rhythm, and word choice are exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often lyrical, with high information density and strong momentum. The sentence structure is varied, and the descriptions are concise yet evocative. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops. The piece avoids overwriting for the most part, though a few phrases like "a haunting melody of what once was" lean on familiar constructions, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, resonant phrasing like "lovingly cauterized" and "gnawing at his edges." However, a few moments rely on abstract summary ("a panic so profound it was a physical presence") or slight cliché ("a pain that cleansed rather than destroyed") where a more concrete image would have been stronger. The opening paragraph shows a minor template cadence ("He was," "He now existed," "His sanctuary was") that briefly dulls the rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive. Word choices are precise and evocative, particularly in descriptions of the crystallizing air ("shimmering, fractaling air"). The piece avoids almost all prose artifacts, though the conceptual explanation ("Then she understood, the core concept snapping into place...") is a moment of efficient telling that borders on an info-dump. While necessary for pacing, it's a slight concession in an otherwise seamless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is evocative and generally well-controlled, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, there are minor instances of telling over showing ("His motivation was simple yet profound") and thematic summary ("The truth was not a weapon; it was a pathology"). The block of technical explanation, while necessary, briefly slows the narrative momentum, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, with each sentence contributing to character, atmosphere, or momentum. Figurative language, such as the armor as a "withdrawn knight's shell," is purposeful and effective. The piece is free of scaffolding or loops; even the repetition of "shivering bliss" is a deliberate and powerful thematic echo that charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and concise for most of the story, with strong verbs and specific imagery ("its sides soft with age," "a ghostly negative of the message"). However, the final paragraphs, while grammatically clean, lean towards abstraction and conceptual summary ("The examined unknown had yielded its truth"). This shift slightly dulls the sharp, concrete imagery that preceded it, creating a momentum drag right at the moment of closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and demonstrates strong rhythmic control, particularly in the opening paragraphs. The line-level craft is mostly excellent, with high information density. The score is held back by a noticeable template cadence in the final paragraph ("He would..."), which reads as a stylistic artifact that slightly flattens the otherwise powerful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. Sentence structure is varied, creating a rhythm that mirrors the musical struggle. Word choices like "a scar on the air" and a "purchased" silence are both original and effective, and the piece is free of cliché, loops, or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with high information density. However, it is marred by the jarring phrase "emerges transformed always" in the penultimate paragraph, a significant artifact that obscures meaning at the climax. Additionally, some phrasing like "a single, perfect mote of moonstone cabochon dust speck" is overwrought, sacrificing concision for adjective density. These slips detract from an otherwise strong execution.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely free of artifacts, with high information density in its descriptive passages. The rhythm is well-paced, building momentum effectively toward the climax. While lines like "a woman of intricate certainties in a world of imprecise time" are well-crafted, a few such constructions feel more writerly than organic to the moment. The final paragraph explains the epiphany slightly more than it needs to, but it does so concisely and provides a strong cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates high information density without feeling cluttered. The figurative language, particularly the central kintsugi metaphor, is sustained and purposeful. The sentence structure varies effectively, creating a rhythm that is both deliberate and compelling, especially in the passages describing the alchemical process. The piece is free of noticeable line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is evocative and generally precise, with strong imagery like "a lonely curation of grief." There are no significant technical errors. The weakness lies in occasional instances of overwriting, such as the self-explanatory phrase "not without fear but knew how to move with it," which could be dramatized more effectively. These moments slightly dilute the momentum and trust in the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and highly effective, characterized by precise word choice and evocative imagery like "a receding tide, leaving his nervous system raw and buzzing on the shore of consciousness." The piece avoids overwriting and shows excellent rhythmic control, with sentence structure modulating to match the character's internal state. There are no notable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively, creating a fluid momentum that carries the reader through the story. Information density is high, with phrases like "a furious knot of captured light" doing significant descriptive and atmospheric work. While the style is elevated, it avoids becoming overwrought and remains clear and purposeful, with no discernible loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is superb. The prose exhibits high information density, strong verbs, and evocative, original imagery ("dust motes... drifted in the dimness like lazy confetti"). There is zero scaffolding, redundancy, or overwriting. The piece is a showcase of clarity, precision, and rhythmic control from the opening sentence to the resonant final line.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant and information-dense, with a strong command of rhythm and syntax that supports the story's atmospheric build. Figurative language, such as reality being "negotiable" or feeling "rewilding steel," is both original and thematically coherent. The line-level craft is exceptionally clean, with varied sentence structures and precise word choices that propel the narrative without any discernible loops, scaffolding, or overwriting in the pivotal closing beats.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and highly evocative, with virtually no wasted words. Figurative language is sophisticated and integral to the story's meaning, not ornamental ("liturgy of burnished sorrow," "crushing weight of chronology"). Sentence structure is varied, creating a compelling rhythm that carries the narrative forward. There are no notable prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every line serves to build character, atmosphere, or momentum toward the powerful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with high information density. Sentences are constructed with a clear rhythm that builds momentum towards the climax. While the language is highly figurative ("soul of a melody," "dissonant chord... in the great celestial harmony"), it stays within a consistent register and avoids becoming overwrought or unclear. There are no notable scaffold phrases or loops; every line serves to advance the story's tone, world, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished, with strong, evocative word choice and a confident rhythm. However, a few key moments rely on slightly over-engineered figurative language, such as the "series of hinged awakenings" metaphor, which reads as a conceptual scaffold. While the prose is largely excellent, these instances briefly pull focus from the experience to the construction.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    The prose is ambitious, rhythmic, and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it is marred by a few distinct prose artifacts that disrupt its momentum. The line "It was an idea given physical shape, a concept made manifest" is a clear paraphrase loop that restates the same information, a flaw that briefly stalls the narrative right after the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with a strong rhythmic control. However, it is held back by the critical error in the seasonal description ("winter's snow... in autumn"), a line-level mistake that breaks basic logic. Additionally, there's a slight tendency towards over-writing in the final paragraph, where the thematic weight is articulated a bit too explicitly, momentarily sacrificing subtlety for clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density and strong momentum. Lines like "a scream etched into the air itself" demonstrate exceptional craft. The score is slightly tempered by a few minor instances of scaffolding, such as "a wild, illogical thought took hold" and "Her motivation crystallized," which summarize an internal state rather than fully embodying it. These are small slips that do not detract from the otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and controlled, with strong verbs and evocative imagery like the light "seeping into the thirsty wood." Momentum is well-maintained. A minor weakness is a brief turn to strategic telling in the final paragraph ("She did not resurrect the people; she resurrected their context..."), which clarifies the conceptual closure at the cost of some immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly effective, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("leach the very warmth from the air," "sharpened into a blade of dread"). Sentence structure is varied, and the rhythm of the prose skillfully modulates the story’s tension. The piece is remarkably free of artifacts or redundancies, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft and polish. A few phrases feel slightly less sharp than the surrounding prose, but this is a minor observation in an otherwise excellent piece.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, polished, and demonstrates exceptional command of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are constructed with precision, varying in length and structure to match the story’s pacing from contemplative stillness to the focused intensity of the climax. While the density of figurative language is very high ("a reverse lightning strike of growth," "a spectrum of liquid suns"), it rarely feels overwrought, instead contributing to the story's potent, mythic atmosphere. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, maintaining clear momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and largely excellent, with strong verbs and purposeful syntax. The rhythm and pacing are controlled, especially during the tense wait for the signal. The score is held back from the highest tier by a few instances of prose that feel like authorial summary rather than character thought, such as "Her credibly curious nature was her greatest tool," which reads more like a character sketch than in-the-moment interiority.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, with sentences that consistently serve character, atmosphere, and plot. The rhythm is controlled, creating a meditative pace that matches the story’s tone. There are no technical errors, but a slight tendency towards elevated, poetic phrasing ("primal elegance," "borrowed catharsis") occasionally risks feeling overwritten, preventing a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density in most lines. However, a few phrases slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution. Lines like "apologies and confessions trapped in their ethereal throats" and "Her silent plea was the loudest thing he had ever heard" lean on familiar constructions. The thematic summary in the fifth paragraph ("The covenant was not just... but between past and future...") feels a touch explicit in an otherwise beautifully implicit story, a minor scaffolding that could be removed.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative word choice (“a seamless tapestry of stagnation”). There are no scaffold phrases, paraphrase loops, or overwriting; every sentence works to advance the story’s atmosphere or internal state. The clarity and elegance of the line-level craft are flawless, supporting the story's quiet, profound tone without drawing undue attention.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.2)
    While the prose is often beautiful and evocative, it suffers from several artifacts in the final third that dull its impact. There is a clear paraphrase loop ("She had discovered the profound beauty... The kite... was more beautiful for having fallen..."), which repeats the same idea without adding pressure. The language also drifts into abstraction, relying on words like "meaning," "beauty," and "creation" instead of concrete imagery, which slightly weakens an otherwise strong finish.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often beautiful, with a strong rhythmic control that matches the protagonist's meditative state. Figurative language, like the "cold stone in my pocket," is effective and integrated. There are a few minor instances of scaffolding where the prose explains itself, such as "a term that defined both my method and my spirit," which briefly pulls away from pure dramatization. These are small slips in an otherwise impeccably crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and efficient, with high information density in each sentence. Figurative language is purposeful and resonant, such as "the architecture of an artificial pilgrimage" and the description of the "bronze quiet." There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; the rhythm is measured and controlled, mirroring the deliberate pace of the walk and the character's thought process.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.8)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, potent and original figurative language ("rattled like tiny bones," "seeding a graveyard with words from its own ghosts"), and varied, elegant syntax. There are no prose artifacts, loops, or wasted words; every sentence contributes to the story's momentum and atmosphere. The final paragraph, in particular, demonstrates superb rhythmic control, slowing to a quiet, impactful conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often lyrical and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery that build a palpable atmosphere. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled. However, there is a recurring tendency towards overwriting, with stacked descriptors that occasionally blunt the impact of the images ("dull orange sun bled into the grey earth"). A few phrases feel slightly clunky or repetitive, such as the repeated use of "intuitively descriptive," which reads more like a prompt requirement than natural prose.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong rhythm and precise word choice ("crystalline exile," "a single moment pulled like taffy"). Momentum is well-maintained, and sentences are generally dense with meaning. A few instances of conceptual repetition slightly mar the otherwise clean lines, such as the direct statement of motivation ("turn confusion into exploration") being echoed in the final paragraph ("The confusion of his exile had crystallized..."). These minor scaffold-like phrases prevent a higher score but do not significantly impede the story's power.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally strong, particularly in its evocative opening descriptions. However, it is slightly weakened by a few familiar phrases ("breath hung like a ghost") and, most significantly, by the final paragraph. The concluding sentences fall into a summary-like, repetitive structure that feels like scaffolding, explaining the character's transformation rather than letting the preceding action speak for itself, which dulls the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong rhythm ("a silent, anxious pause between the fall of one regime and the rise of the next"). While generally excellent, a few phrases like "shocking benevolence" and "cold stone in her gut" lean slightly towards labeling or stock imagery, a minor blemish on an otherwise stellar piece of writing. There are no significant structural artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story. However, the final paragraphs exhibit a minor lack of concision, stating the character's newfound understanding multiple times in slightly different ways. This creates a slight paraphrase loop that marginally dulls the impact of the otherwise powerful closure, preventing the prose from achieving perfect propulsion in its final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptive passages. The rhythm is well-paced, slowing for introspection and quickening with discovery. A minor deduction is warranted for a slight tendency towards overwriting, with dense adjectival phrases that occasionally border on the ornate, and for the summary-like statement in the final paragraph which reads like scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmic, with powerful imagery throughout ("a needle stitching the heavy sky to the canyon floor"). Sentences are constructed with care and propulsion. A minor deduction is warranted for moments of summary that replace dramatization, particularly the line "He gave them not facts, but feelings..." and the thematic explanations in the closing paragraph. These instances of telling, while concise, slightly flatten the immediacy of the story's climax and resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery that build a palpable atmosphere from the first sentence. Sentence structure varies effectively to control rhythm and momentum. While a few phrases like "quilt memories together" are repeated, the second use functions as a deliberate, climactic reprise rather than a redundant loop. The overall effect is one of high information density and narrative propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, particularly in its descriptive passages ("a sound like a frozen lake giving way"). However, the momentum is periodically stalled by sentences that function as authorial explanation rather than character experience, such as the direct summary of what the cracked mirror "revealed." These moments of scaffolding, while clear, feel less crafted than the surrounding prose and slightly dull the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often luminous and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there is a tendency toward overwriting in key moments, with dense clusters of adjectives and figurative language that slightly dull the momentum. The primary weakness is the final paragraph, which lapses into summary and explanation, undermining the preceding scene-work.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and frequently powerful, with strong, evocative imagery (“map of verdigris continents,” “a silent scream containing everything they were”). The momentum is excellent, driven by clean syntax and varied sentence structure. The score is slightly tempered by a few instances of efficient but less impactful "telling," such as directly stating her motivation ("to navigate the geography of loss") or solace, where showing was already doing the work effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.5)
    The prose is often strong and evocative, but it is critically undermined by a glaring technical artifact in the final sentence. The inclusion of Chinese characters ("属于自己的") is an inexplicable, immersion-breaking flaw that severely damages the story's closing beat. For a piece aiming for flawless publication, this kind of unforced error is a major liability that requires significant revision.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. There are, however, moments where the lyricism feels slightly self-conscious, as with the repetition of "softly persistent." The main weakness is a tendency towards high-level conceptual phrases ("a curator of absence," "a question mark he felt compelled to answer") that, while elegant, can feel more like authorial labels than organic character thought. The line-level craft is otherwise clean and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with high information density. The final paragraph, however, slips into summary ("her entire life seemed to condense into this single moment—the years of isolation, the quiet obsession, the desperate need for direction"), which tells the reader the emotional stakes instead of letting the image of the reflection carry the weight alone, slightly dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm throughout. However, a few key moments rely on abstraction or telling where showing would be more powerful, such as the "mist of pure emotion" or the summary statement, "She saw the delicate balance of all things." These instances slightly blunt the immediacy of the climax, preventing the otherwise polished prose from reaching a flawless standard.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, but it occasionally slips into abstraction or overwriting that can dull momentum. Phrases like "a scientifically romantic affair" or "directed spontaneity" feel more like authorial labels than a character's immediate experience. While the rhythm and word choice are generally strong, these moments of high-concept summary slightly detract from the otherwise concrete and sensory-rich narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propulsive, with no discernible scaffolding or redundancy. Sentence structure is varied for rhythmic effect, and figurative language ("bottled tempests," "shimmering tapestry") is consistently purposeful and integrated into the character's voice. Clarity is maintained even during the surreal turn, where concise lines like "The laws of physics softened, then surrendered" handle a complex transition with masterful economy.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and economical, with high information density in every sentence ("a cartographer of emotional terrain with her primary map stolen"). The rhythm of the language mirrors the story's content—calm on the surface, with deep currents of grief and meaning underneath. There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and no figurative missteps; the craft is pristine and serves the story's emotional core without calling attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single wasted word or clunky phrase. Figurative language is fresh and purposeful, such as the crystallization that "spiderweb[s] across her skin." The piece is entirely free of scaffolding, loops, or other artifacts, reading as polished, professional, and immediately publishable work.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and rhythmically controlled. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative, achieving high information density without feeling overwritten. The figurative language, while abundant, serves the voice and atmosphere rather than obscuring the action. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding to dull its momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, there are moments where the language drifts into a slightly too-academic register, explaining concepts rather than embodying them (e.g., "the recursive process by which the universe settled its conflicts..."). While this fits the character's intellectual nature, it occasionally flattens the narrative momentum and feels more like a philosophical abstract than lived prose, particularly in the second paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong opening imagery and a confident rhythm. The writing is concise and propulsive. A minor deduction is made for the final two sentences, where the craft shifts from showing to telling, summarizing the story's thematic insight in a way that feels less artful than the descriptive work that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and evocative, with high information density. Sentences like "a subterranean galaxy that pulsed with a slow, silent breath" are superb. However, a few phrases ("non-Euclidean geometries of grief," "quiet wildfire of her obsession") feel slightly overwrought or self-conscious. The verb choice "bleat" for the dawn is also jarring and pulls the reader out momentarily, a minor blemish on an otherwise strong performance.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, clear, and demonstrates strong rhythmic control. However, there is a consistent reliance on descriptive adjectives throughout the piece ("simple urn," "rainwashed countryside," "musty, frozen," "singular, fragile"). While individually effective, their density creates a slight stylistic tic that borders on overwriting and could benefit from a more rigorous culling in favor of stronger verbs and nouns.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong, specific imagery like "crystallized moonlight" and "symphony of fresh starts composed from discords." Sentences are well-constructed with a varied rhythm that supports the story's quiet, humming momentum. There are no significant technical flaws, though a few phrases lean towards high-concept abstraction where a more concrete sensory detail might have landed with more force.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is luminous, concise, and rhythmically controlled. Figurative language is both fresh and perfectly integrated, as in "a planetoid of grief and love" or Elara's voice being "a low wind over dunes." There are no line-level artifacts, loops, or wasted words; every sentence carries weight and propels the narrative with grace.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative imagery ("iron ribs of the roof," "soil-stained knees"). The rhythm is controlled and sentences are well-crafted. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraph, which drifts into summary ("He had catalyzed a cure by understanding that..."), a moment of telling that slightly dulls the impact of the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and evocative, original imagery. Sentences are dense with meaning and propel the narrative forward with a confident rhythm. A slight tendency toward stacking poetic metaphors, as in "the pause of shifting constellations, a single, held breath of the night sky," occasionally verges on being overwritten, a hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is crystalline. The prose exhibits high information density and rhythmic control, moving from technical description to embodied reflection with seamless grace. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold phrases; every sentence propels the narrative or deepens the character's internal state. Figurative language, like the nib "shaped like a tiny nebula," is purposeful and reinforces the story's core concepts without ever feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and highly effective, with strong imagery like “water shimmered like a plate of liquid silver.” The momentum is excellent, with no wasted words or scaffolding. The only minor weakness is a single phrase, “a pang of sorrow, sharp and deep, struck Elara’s heart,” which feels slightly more generic than the otherwise distinctive prose. However, this is a negligible slip in an otherwise pristine execution that does not touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, clear, and often beautiful, with strong sentence-level propulsion. The rhythm and word choice effectively build the story's reverent atmosphere. The score is slightly tempered by a few instances of overwriting where figurative language becomes overly dense or abstract, as with “desperate act of volcanic tenderness,” which tells rather than evokes the intended emotional complexity.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is polished and evocative, demonstrating high information density without sacrificing clarity or momentum. Word choices like "psychic solvent" and "auroral sorrow" are precise and resonant. The prose is free of loops or scaffolding, and its figurative language consistently deepens character and atmosphere rather than feeling ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is evocative and efficient, with high information density and strong, varied rhythms. The line-level craft is sharp and clean, creating a palpable atmosphere without overwriting. There are no notable loops, scaffold sentences, or figurative muddles, even in the moments of highest tension.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    While the prose is often beautiful and evocative, it is marked by minor but noticeable flaws for this tier of publication. The awkward, repeated adverb "spiralingly" is a tic that stands out, and there are moments of telling ("threatened to swallow hope itself") and cliché ("pressure before a storm"). These issues, while not pervasive, slightly undermine the otherwise high level of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is often elegant and features striking images. However, there are noticeable prose artifacts that hinder its momentum. The repetition of the key phrase "plant forests of second thoughts" acts as a conceptual loop. The final paragraph contains several sentences that paraphrase the same idea ("curated a shared thought," "cradled their fear and handed back a quiet courage"), which reads like scaffolding rather than propulsive prose.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. Lines like "the screech of metal the only violence left in the world" are superb. The score is slightly tempered by a few instances of abstraction where concrete imagery would be stronger, such as labeling the feeling as a "profound, resonant longing" instead of fully embodying it through physical sensation or action.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is of a very high caliber. The prose is concise, rhythmic, and dense with meaning, with no wasted words or scaffolding. Word choice is precise and evocative ("corrosive cheer," "petrified lavender bloom"). The figurative language is powerful and integrated, never feeling ornamental. The sentences propel the narrative forward while simultaneously building a thick, palpable atmosphere, demonstrating exceptional control.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prose is ambitious but suffers from overwriting and conceptual redundancy. Phrases like "a cascade of potential verses, not in words but in pure, structured emotion" are overly abstract. There are several instances of paraphrase loops (e.g., restating the sacredness of the silence), which slow momentum and dull the otherwise sharp imagery, preventing the line-level craft from matching the story's high concept.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with high information density in its imagery ("hands stained with the ghosts of a thousand hues"). The rhythm and word choice are consistently excellent until the final paragraph. There, a slight shift into an explanatory, scaffold-like cadence ("She had received more than an awakening; she had found a language") slightly dulls the momentum and impact of the closure, preventing a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a few moments lean toward overwriting, particularly the phrase "golden shadows, warm, deep, and full of hidden light," which is later capitalized as "Golden Shadows given voice." This recurring phrase feels slightly less organic than the rest of the prose and introduces a hint of sentimentality that the story otherwise skillfully avoids.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, with strong imagery. However, the climactic paragraph contains some prose artifacts that dull its impact. It features a conceptual summary ("Her motivation clarified...") and repeats the slightly awkward phrase "genuinely artificial." These moments of telling and label-like language disrupt the otherwise immersive, showing-oriented craft of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and carries a high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentences like "Data, her grandmother had scribbled in a margin, is just another form of spirit" are both lyrical and conceptually vital. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or scaffolding; every word contributes to momentum, character, or atmosphere. The syntax is varied and the rhythm is controlled, creating a polished and immersive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. There are a few moments where the phrasing verges on being slightly overwritten ("atoms of nostalgia," "discordant drum of anguished joy"), but these are minor. The primary weakness is the final paragraph's shift from evocative prose to direct thematic summary, which momentarily breaks the established craft.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density. However, at the most critical emotional turning points—the realization of "luminous regret" and the final "metamorphose"—the language shifts from concrete imagery to abstract conceptual summary. While articulate, this tells the reader about the change rather than fully immersing them in the sensory experience of it, slightly dulling the immediacy of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.3)
    The line-level craft is strong, with vivid imagery and a controlled, meditative rhythm. The prose is clean and purposeful for most of the piece. The score is slightly reduced by a few instances of telling where showing would be stronger, particularly the sentences that summarize the thematic resolution, which read as scaffolding rather than organic prose.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propelled by strong, specific language ("viscous tendrils," "susurrus of root and tendril," "meteor hush"). Figurative language is consistently purposeful and integrated rather than ornamental. There are no wasted words or scaffold; every sentence contributes to the whole. The read-aloud quality is excellent, with a varied cadence that supports the story's quiet, intense mood.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. Line-level momentum is excellent, carrying the reader through the visionary sequence without a wasted word. The callback of "hushed thunder" to describe the revelation is a particularly effective touch. While a few phrases lean toward abstraction, the overall execution is exceptionally clean and free of artifacts, loops, or overwritten passages.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is evocative and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific imagery. However, there is a slight tendency towards overwriting, particularly with stacked figurative language. For instance, a meteor's path is described as both "a sentence in a celestial instruction manual" and "a route plotted on a map of longing" in the same beat, which feels redundant. A more disciplined approach, allowing a single powerful metaphor to do the work, would have sharpened the line-level impact without sacrificing the lyrical quality.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, with high information density in its imagery. However, during the climactic sequence of the "charm," the sentences fall into a repetitive template cadence ("She holds... She focuses... She does not force... she offers... She coaxes..."). This slightly flattens the rhythm at a peak moment. While the conceptual language is integral, this structural repetition is a minor but noticeable artifact that briefly interrupts the otherwise masterful flow.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with high information density. However, the final paragraph contains a conceptual paraphrase loop ("He had come to rediscover a frontier, and instead, he had found a home" followed by "The wild frontier was not a place to be found, but a connection to be made"). This repetition, while thematic, is a prose artifact that slightly dulls the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is evocative and maintains a strong rhythm, but the final paragraph suffers from several paraphrase loops. The repetition of the "no longer X, but Y" structure ("no longer an escape, but a journey," "no longer traversing away from something, but toward everything") restates the same idea and dulls the momentum of an otherwise potent closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences like "This decision was a spark of frostbitten hope, a feeling so cold it burned" demonstrate excellent line-level craft. There are, however, minor moments of overwriting ("a bargain that pardoned nothing, that forgave no sins") and a few phrases like "seraphically mundane" that feel slightly self-conscious, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, polished, and propulsive, with a high degree of information and atmosphere packed into each sentence. The line-level craft is exceptional, avoiding redundancies or cliché phrasing. While the style is ornate, it remains clear and purposeful, serving the epic tone without devolving into purple prose, even during the high-pressure climax.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and dense with meaning. Word choice is consistently strong and evocative ("tenacious holdout," "obstinately vivid"). A minor, isolated awkwardness in the phrase "a cycle that felt periodically eternal" is the only element preventing a higher score, but overall the line-level craft is exceptional and propels the narrative with a quiet, confident momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong verbs and evocative sensory language creating a dense, immersive atmosphere. The rhythm is well-controlled, particularly in the simple, impactful sentences of the climax. There is a minor tendency toward abstract summary at peak moments (e.g., "crystallized into a single, terrifying action"), where more direct sensory embodiment would hit harder, but the overall craft is very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, a few moments rely on summary rather than dramatization (e.g., "It was a slow, beautiful process of decoding"), which slightly tempers the immediacy. While the line-level craft is very high, these minor instances of telling over showing prevent it from reaching the highest tier of excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is polished and evocative, characterized by high information density and precise, sensory language. Figurative language, such as the photo transforming from an "anchor" to a "stone," is purposeful and deepens the narrative. While one or two phrases in the opening paragraph are slightly less sharp than the rest ("a living thing"), the prose in the high-pressure climax and the resonant closure is flawless, free of any artifacts that would dull its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with striking and efficient imagery. The piece is marred only by a slight shift into summary in the final two paragraphs ("She was not just escaping; she was editing her own existence..."). This moment of telling, rather than showing, at the story's climax is a minor but distinct flaw that prevents a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. However, a few key moments rely on slightly abstract or overly literary phrasing that dilutes the immediacy of the discovery. Phrases like "a phantom dance of light and shadow, telling a story of eternal cycles and the fragile skin of reality" feel more like authorial summary than a character's direct perception in a moment of crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is exceptionally clean, dense, and propulsive, with not a single wasted word. Lines like "Silence was the only currency" and "She had not spoken a word, but she had screamed across time" are both beautiful and functionally powerful. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, and its syntactic variety creates a compelling rhythm that carries the reader through the swift, decisive action.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is of a professional, publishable quality. Sentences are constructed with rhythmic precision and high information density, as seen in the opening line. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative ("a tranquil blaze," "senselessly perceptive"), creating a prose texture that is both beautiful and propulsive.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is rich, dense, and evocative, with a high degree of information and imagery packed into each sentence. While the figurative language is consistently strong ("water that shimmered with stolen starlight"), its sheer density borders on overwriting in a few places. However, the momentum never flags, and the clarity of action during the critical climax remains impeccable, showcasing excellent control.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propelled by strong, specific verbs and vivid imagery. The astronomical metaphors are integrated seamlessly, elevating the language without becoming overwrought or obscuring meaning. There are no wasted words or repetitive sentence structures; each line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or the central argument of the story. The final paragraph, in particular, demonstrates exceptional line-level craft, landing the story's conclusion with grace and precision.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is outstanding: dense, lyrical, and precise, with no wasted words or overwriting. Figurative language, such as "a quiet rebellion against noise" and "the meteor hush of the deep night," is both beautiful and functional, advancing character and atmosphere. The sentence-level propulsion is masterful, creating a sense of deliberate, focused action that culminates in a clear and powerful climax.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise for most of the story, with high information density and strong rhythm ("stained a permanent rainbow," "brittle with the same unease that coloured the air"). There are no significant loops or artifacts. The score is held back slightly by the final paragraph's shift toward expository prose, which explains the resolution rather than letting the final actions and images convey it entirely.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    The line-level craft is predominantly excellent, with vivid, specific imagery and a compelling rhythm. However, there are a few minor instances of conceptual repetition that create drag. The phrase "warm coldness" is repeated, and the final paragraph contains several sentences that paraphrase the same core idea of renaming the past. While effective, this slight redundancy and a tendency toward abstraction in the final sentences keep the prose from being flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Figurative language is consistently evocative and serves the story's mechanics, such as memory fragments appearing as "trembling ribbons of silver light." The piece is remarkably clean, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or overwriting; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or the accumulative pressure of the central magical act.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. However, a few key moments are slightly marred by overwriting. The phrase "willowglass hope—delicate yet resilient, transparent yet shimmering with potential" feels like an authorial definition, and the final sentence summarizes the thematic arc. These small intrusions of telling slightly blunt the impact of an otherwise powerfully shown conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and often luminous, marked by strong rhythm and precise word choice. There are, however, moments where abstraction replaces concrete sensation, particularly in describing the data from the device ("patterns not of data, but of meaning"). While the line-level craft is high, these instances of telling slightly blunt the immediacy of the peak experience.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with many beautiful phrases like "a single dark note against a pale cascade." The sentence structure is controlled and contributes to the story's grave, meditative rhythm. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward conceptual summary in moments of climax, such as explaining that the prophecy was "expanded into a spectrum of potential futures," which tells the reader an effect that the image of the sand has already powerfully shown.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, confident, and demonstrates high information density. Opening lines like "The silence on Zephyr Bluff was a living thing, a silver hush" are immediately immersive. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, accelerating with the action and slowing for reflection. The writing is almost flawless, held back only by a few instances of direct thematic summary, such as "He saw something broken that he could fix."

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and dense with imagery. However, it occasionally strays into slight overwriting with phrases that feel more writerly than observational ("spindrift serenity"). There are also minor instances of paraphrase, such as defining the ticking gutters as "the precise measure," which, while small, represent a missed opportunity for greater concision and trust in the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and high-density, with strong verbs and evocative sensory details that carry the story's momentum. The language is precise and avoids overwriting, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. There are a couple of moments of efficient telling ("The method to reassemble the chronology revealed itself...") that are slightly less immersive but serve economy in a short piece, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and specific imagery. Sentences are crafted with a poet's ear for rhythm and concision. The brief anaphoric repetition of "instilling" in the third paragraph reads as a successful, deliberate rhetorical device that reinforces the meditative action, rather than a clumsy prose loop. The final line is a perfect cadence, landing with both finality and a sense of beginning.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless, with strong, evocative imagery. Sentences are well-crafted and propel the narrative with a somber momentum. A few phrases, such as "spiritual entropy," lean slightly into high-concept abstraction where a more concrete image might have landed with more force, but this is a minor imperfection in an otherwise polished and powerful piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous and highly polished, demonstrating exceptional clarity, rhythm, and information density from the opening sentence. Word choice is precise and evocative ("prismatic quiet," "grey slurry"), and syntax varies to match the story's emotional cadence. There are no wasted words, loops, or overwritten passages; every line serves to advance character, atmosphere, or action with impeccable craft.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, propulsive, and often elegant, particularly in its descriptions of the station and the signal. There are, however, a few moments where interiority is summarized rather than embodied (e.g., "Her motivation was singular now..."). While effective for pacing, these instances slightly blunt the immediacy of her internal state in an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is polished, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific, memorable imagery ("swam like silver eels," "lattice-like structures of hardened air"). The rhythm and momentum are excellent, accelerating during the crisis and settling into a quiet cadence at the end. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding until the final paragraph's thematic summary, which is the only minor blemish on an otherwise stellar line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly evocative, with high information density and a clear, forward momentum. The language is consistently strong, with memorable phrases that serve character and atmosphere. The score is held back slightly by a few instances of scaffolding that state the internal process too directly, such as, "The analytical artist and the feeling man had to work as one." While a minor flaw, it momentarily flattens the subtext in an otherwise masterful piece.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong verbs and memorable images like "concrete blister." However, a few moments rely on familiar phrasing ("heart hammered against her ribs") and a minor grammatical error ("nervously confidence hardened into resolve") slightly mars the otherwise polished surface. While the line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, these small slips prevent a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few moments slightly mar the execution. The phrase "a secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters" is an opaque metaphor that briefly stalls momentum. The final paragraph, while effective, uses a slightly repetitive sentence structure ("The ghost had given... The possibility he now held...") that feels more like a summary than a final, embodied moment.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, particularly in the opening paragraphs. However, the final paragraph's rhythm shifts into a series of short, abstract, parallel phrases ("The ambition and the retreat. The dream and the trap."). This stylistic choice feels slightly out of voice and veers towards summarizing the theme, momentarily dulling the otherwise sharp and specific prose that precedes it.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is polished and often evocative, but it occasionally relies on abstractions or slightly overwrought phrases, such as "a perfect vessel for midnight solace." The final paragraph, in particular, tends to summarize action and intent ("She began to write the story of the star, weaving the words into a narrative...") rather than grounding the moment in a more concrete sensory detail. There are no significant errors, but a tighter focus on showing over telling in key beats would elevate it further.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong imagery and varied sentence rhythms. There are no significant line-level artifacts like loops or template cadences. A few minor moments lean toward abstraction ("The temptation was a physical weight," "a fuller truth"), but the language is overwhelmingly concrete and effective, especially during the chaotic opening and the stark clarity of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, demonstrating strong command. The sentences are well-paced and propelled by strong verbs. Minor blemishes prevent a higher score: the repetition of "anxious elation" and the slightly clichéd "symphony of fear and wonder." These are small frictions in an otherwise polished and highly effective piece of writing.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and evocative figurative language, such as her mind being a 'furnace of possible futures'. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful throughout. The only minor flaw is the thematic summary sentence ("She had come to patch the world’s soul..."), which reads like a piece of authorial scaffolding that breaks the immersive texture of the final moments.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is strong and evocative for the most part, with phrases like "metallic taste of public failure" and "cathedral of rust" landing effectively. However, the final paragraph becomes slightly too declarative, summarizing the thematic shift ("He wasn’t just cataloging... He was preserving..."). This move toward summary sacrifices some of the lyrical power built earlier, making the conclusion feel more explained than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, confident, and demonstrates high information density. However, the final paragraph contains phrases that function as thematic scaffolding ("a testament to what had transitioned, not what was lost"), summarizing the emotional shift rather than relying solely on the powerful preceding images. This slight move from showing to telling at the moment of closure is the only notable flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The sentence structure varies effectively, and the language is precise. Minor deductions are for the repetition of "wintersun serenity" and a few instances of phrasing that lean toward telling a scale of emotion ("a thousand loves, a hundred thousand regrets") rather than embodying a specific instance of it.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are constructed with a clear sense of rhythm and purpose. A slight friction point is the phrase "A wave of sensory memory not her own washed over her," which uses a common trope; however, it is immediately grounded in specific, effective details. The overall craft is very high, with no significant artifacts to impede momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often evocative and rhythmic, particularly in its description of the setting. However, there are occasional slips into overwriting and cliché ("struck her with the force of a physical blow"). The final paragraphs contain some summary and scaffolding that could be trimmed to allow the final image to carry more weight on its own.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, the momentum is slightly impeded by a moment of technical exposition that feels out of register with the surrounding lyricism: "...the method to breach the seal, she realized, was through propagation delays." This brief shift into jargon, while functional, momentarily breaks the narrative spell and reads more like a mechanical explanation than an organic discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong momentum. Lines like "a perforated destiny" and the violin dissolving into "a mist of diamond dust" are vivid and impactful. A few minor phrases, such as "a quiet, thrumming thing in her chest," lean towards familiar constructions, slightly holding it back from perfection, but the overall craft is exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is luminous and dense, with nearly every sentence serving multiple functions of character, atmosphere, and action. Word choice is precise and evocative ("radiant hush," "geometric afterimage"), and sentence rhythm modulates to match the pacing of the ritual. The piece is remarkably free of scaffolding or redundancy. While the language is consistently elevated, it feels authentic to the story's world and voice rather than overwritten, maintaining clarity and propulsion even at its most figurative.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is clean, concise, and elegant, demonstrating strong rhythmic control and sentence variety. The language is precise and purposeful, avoiding overwriting or line-level artifacts. Lines like "a stillness earned only after forgiving the unforgivable" show a high level of craft and information density without sacrificing clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and evocative, with strong verbs and precise imagery. Momentum is excellent, with each sentence contributing to atmosphere or character. The score is slightly tempered by one instance of diagnostic summary in a peak moment: "Her voice held a protected vulnerability, a careful honesty..." This phrase explains the effect rather than simply letting the dialogue and action create it, momentarily pulling back from full immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details like "moss-veined stone" and the "sycamore hush of the night." Sentences are well-paced, creating a hypnotic rhythm that supports the story’s meditative mood. There are very occasional moments where the prose verges on being overly ornate ("perfect circles of silvered starlight, marching outward..."), but these instances are minor and do not disrupt the overall high quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional information density and concision, with every sentence contributing to world, character, or momentum. While highly figurative, the language rarely feels overwrought because the metaphors are deeply rooted in the story's unique physics ("a library of fallen ages"). There are no discernible loops or scaffolding; the propulsion from line to line is clean and purposeful, culminating in a powerful and uncluttered final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery ("crystalline orreries," "cushion of solid air"). However, a few moments lean towards abstraction or cliché, such as "a phenomenon of brilliant dimness that called to her" or the slightly too-neat metaphor in "unstrapped herself from more than just leather bindings." These minor instances of telling rather than showing prevent the prose from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptions. Line-level momentum is generally strong, drawing the reader through the scene with fluid rhythm. The story avoids major prose artifacts, but there are minor instances of scaffolding in the first paragraph that summarize character motivation ("His entire motivation...was...") rather than letting it emerge purely from perception and action. While the language is beautiful, these brief moments of telling slightly dull the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and highly polished. Sentence structure varies to control rhythm, accelerating with Alaric's desperation and settling into a profound stillness at the end. Word choice is precise and consistently supports the elevated, speculative tone. There are no wasted words or distracting prose artifacts; every line contributes to atmosphere, character, or the advancement of the internal plot, demonstrating exceptional line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative from the first sentence to the last. Figurative language, such as the astrolabes appearing as “skeletons of sea creatures,” is fresh and thematically coherent. The sentences are rhythmically varied, propelling the quiet narrative forward without a single wasted word or redundant phrase; the piece is free of any noticeable prose artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with vivid, unforced figurative language ("fizzled like a damp wick"). Sentence structure is varied to control pacing, particularly during the climax where the short, percussive sentences mirror the dripping water. There are no wasted words or scaffolding; every line contributes to character, world, or plot. The piece is exceptionally clean and polished at the line level.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and highly polished. Each sentence carries weight, advancing character, setting, or plot with no wasted words. The imagery is sharp and memorable, and the syntax varies to create a compelling rhythm that complements the story's solemn pace. The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting, demonstrating a high degree of craft.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, vivid, and generally strong. Momentum is well-maintained. A few instances of cliché phrasing ("Panic, cold and sharp, lanced through her," "heart hammered against her ribs") and a tendency toward summary in the final emotional beats ("A gentle warmth bloomed...") prevent it from reaching the highest tier. The craft is excellent but not flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The prose is clean, clear, and maintains momentum. However, several moments rely on abstract summary or slightly clunky phrasing where concrete action would be stronger (e.g., "her movements a product of attentively inventive problem-solving," "The watcher’s burden crystallized in that moment"). These minor prose artifacts prevent the piece from achieving true line-level flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong imagery and varied sentence structure. Lines like “mountains melted into seas and empires faded to myth in the blink of an eye” are vivid and efficient. However, there are minor instances of conceptual shorthand, such as naming the internal conflict a “clone custody battle” directly, which verges on telling. While the writing is largely concise, a few phrases lean on familiar genre vocabulary ("ego death," "psychic storm") where more specific description could have been stronger.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally polished, with strong rhythm and clarity. However, several moments lean on abstract, elevated phrasing that feels slightly overwritten, such as "unfolded across the hush of a possibility just born." These flourishes, while atmospheric, occasionally blur precision and reduce momentum by opting for poetic summary over concrete, unfolding action, particularly during the key investigative beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is ambitious and often beautiful, marked by powerful, resonant metaphors like memory as "compost." However, it occasionally tips into overwriting, with a high density of figurative language that can feel effortful. The primary weakness is the inclusion of scaffolding sentences that state intent rather than embodying it, such as "The method was inelegant, brutal even," which detracts from the otherwise strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with high information density and rhythmic control. Phrasing like "woven from mist and hoarfrost" and "a seam, a place where reality had been poorly stitched" is superb. A minor deduction is warranted for the climax, where the slightly clinical phrase "re-interiorizing the exterior threat" feels like a brief register drift away from the more poetic voice, momentarily thinning the texture at a peak moment. Otherwise, the line-level craft is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and purposeful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-structured, carrying momentum through the creative process. A minor deduction is warranted for the phrase "when the penny dropped," an idiom that feels slightly anachronistic and clashes with the established high-fantasy register. Another line, "The idea did not come whole, but through successive approximation," reads as slightly abstract summary in a passage otherwise grounded in concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, rhythmic, and dense with evocative imagery. Word choice is consistently strong, with phrases like "shard of hush" and "resonant frequency of nothing" creating a powerful sense of the story's unique physics. A few minor redundancies, such as "calm and powerful luminescence" where "glowing" and "sheen" already did the work, are the only hairline flaws in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely strong, with vivid imagery and controlled rhythm. However, several key moments rely on telling over showing (e.g., "His motivation... was far deeper," "he perceived the method"). The final paragraph also tends toward summary, explicitly stating the "haunting knowledge" rather than letting the final image carry the full weight of the change, slightly dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and confident, with many striking and original phrases ("blueprints were drafted in the febrile hallucinations"). However, a few moments slip into telling over showing, particularly when describing the climax ("It was a violent, overwhelming catharsis"). The final paragraph contains some scaffold-like phrases that state the thematic conclusion, slightly diminishing the powerful ambiguity of the preceding scene.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally very strong, with memorable phrases like "shimmered with captured nebulas." However, a few sentences drift towards summary and thematic statement rather than dramatization. The line "pulling humanity’s horizons with it" is a slight thematic echo that tells the reader what the image means, slightly diluting the power of the final moment. These are minor slips in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. The primary weakness lies in a few sentences that function as scaffolding, explaining the story's theme to the reader instead of advancing the scene. The line beginning "This was the core of incidental heroism..." is a prose artifact that momentarily halts the narrative momentum just before the climax, a notable flaw in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and often lyrical, with strong, specific verbs and memorable images like "cathedral of ruin" and light "bleeding onto the console’s surface." The rhythm and pacing are excellent. Minor issues, such as the slight redundancy in "a crashing hush, a pressure of absolute silence," are present but do not significantly detract from the overall high quality of the line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentences like, “She was a death certificate error survivor, a name on a page that should have signaled an end but instead became a question,” are both lyrical and expository. The piece is free of scaffolding, loops, or other line-level artifacts, maintaining momentum and clarity through to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with no wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language, such as the diamond's core "pulsating like a sick heart" or the laugh multiplied into a "jeering crowd," is both original and purposeful. The sentence structure and rhythm are controlled and build momentum toward the powerful climax and resolution, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific, memorable imagery ("droplets of water to spiral upward from the soil like inverted rain"). The rhythm and syntax support the story's otherworldly atmosphere and Aris's shifting mental state. There are no notable scaffold phrases, loops, or overwriting; every sentence works to advance atmosphere, character, or understanding with concision and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with strong verbs and specific, sensory imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the escalating tension well. Minor weaknesses appear in moments of peak intensity; for instance, the climax features a list of emotions ("fear, hope, longing, love") where a more embodied description would have been stronger. While skillfully written, these few instances of telling over showing at crucial beats keep it just shy of perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. The language is precise, avoiding overwriting while delivering powerful images like "captured lightning" and a "ghost of entertainment." A minor weakness is a slight conceptual redundancy in the final paragraphs ("Each absence he linked...was a stitch" followed later by "Another absence had been linked"), which slightly slows the momentum before the final, potent image.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with high information density in its descriptive passages. The rhythm and syntax support the dreamlike atmosphere effectively. However, a few minor clichés ("machine's heart," "wave of absolute certainty") and the slight overuse of key phrases ("misting hush," "whispering gleam") prevent it from reaching the highest tier. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is lyrical and precise, with many evocative and memorable phrases. However, the final paragraph, while powerful, becomes slightly overwritten with a cascade of abstract concepts ("nascent narratives," "emotional geometries," "potential plots"). This density of figurative language in a peak moment slightly dulls the clarity of the climax, even as it aims for profundity. The piece avoids major artifacts like loops or template cadence, maintaining strong momentum throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is overwhelmingly strong, with evocative imagery and a controlled, rhythmic cadence. However, the prose is uniformly dense with figurative language, which at times slows momentum. A minor paraphrase loop occurs in the first paragraph ("runaway dream"..."This longing"), and the final paragraph leans slightly into summary ("She had not simply taken a picture; she had remade..."), preventing an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and imagistically rich, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm and syntax support the atmospheric, deliberate pacing. Minor deductions are for conceptual redundancies in the final paragraph, where several sentences restate the unending nature of his work, slightly dulling the sharpness of the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a strong sense of place and mood with remarkable economy. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffold-like constructions. The line "He was, quite literally, studying broken constellations" acts as a perfect fulcrum, turning the narrative on a single, clean observation that is both literal and metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and concrete imagery. Lines like "You must learn to sit with the stain of a thing to understand its shape" are masterful. The piece is marred only by a minor conceptual loop; the idea of "combative tenderness" is stated in narration multiple times in slightly different phrasing, a small piece of scaffolding that could have been removed to trust the dramatization more fully.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative, with near-flawless rhythm and word choice. There are no technical errors, loops, or scaffolding. The only minor reservation is that the description of the coalescing magic ("a swirling, silent storm of iridescent light, a tapestry of everything that was beautiful and true") momentarily leans on high-level abstraction rather than a more grounded sensory detail, slightly telling the reader its quality. This is a hairline issue in otherwise exceptional prose.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and often demonstrates high information density. However, there are minor instances of overwriting where figurative language is stacked, creating slight redundancy (e.g., describing the "profound quiet" and "silence" and "interlaced hush" in quick succession). Some sentences in the resolution explain the outcome rather than letting the imagery do the work, a form of subtle scaffolding that slightly dulls the impact of an otherwise sharp piece.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and specific imagery. Sentences are crafted with a framer's precision, creating a rhythm that mirrors the main character's focus. While a couple of phrases like "rhythmic thrum against her ribs" verge on the familiar, they are minor blemishes on an otherwise impeccable surface free of loops, scaffolding, or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong imagery and high information density. However, a few moments rely on cliché ("heart a drum in her ears") or slightly overwrought phrasing ("agonizing slow motion"). The primary weakness is the tendency to explain what has just been shown, particularly in the final paragraph, where direct summary dulls the momentum created by the evocative scene work.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong verbs and specific imagery. The line-level craft is mostly excellent, though a few phrases lean on familiar constructions ("heart hammered against her ribs," "tore across the sky...in stark white relief"). The repetition of "tinkersong wonder" feels like a minor authorial crutch. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished and propulsive piece.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with a strong rhythmic control that mirrors the slow ascent of the elevator. Sentences are well-crafted and carry high information density. There are no significant prose artifacts or loops. The piece loses a few points for moments where the language becomes slightly abstract and less grounded, such as "the light unfolding from the lens revealed a hidden message not on the paper, but on the wall itself," which feels a touch magical rather than mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant, with many memorable and evocative phrases ("sky was more archive than atmosphere"). However, a few key moments rely on abstract summary rather than concrete, embodied action or perception. Phrases like "a quietly explosive tension" and "her script becoming a frantic but precise record" tell the reader the state of things rather than immersing them in the experience, slightly dulling the immediacy of an otherwise sharp narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. Word choices like "cylindrical cocoon" and "ground from solidified moonlight" are both beautiful and specific. The rhythm of the sentences effectively mirrors the story's tension, moving from quiet contemplation to urgent action. There are no notable prose artifacts; the writing is clean and serves the story without drawing undue attention to itself.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and often beautiful, with strong imagery like "living rivers of shadow and noise" and a "permanent, beautiful scar in the fabric of the night." The momentum is excellent, with each sentence advancing the narrative. A few minor instances of conventional phrasing, such as "heart hammering against her ribs," slightly temper the otherwise exceptional line-level craft, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and demonstrates strong command of rhythm and imagery. Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative with a quiet momentum. The only minor flaw is in the final paragraph, where the prose shifts from showing to telling, summarizing the story's theme in a way that feels slightly less crafted than the evocative descriptions preceding it.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are well-crafted, propelling the narrative with a confident rhythm. A few phrases like "tapestry of cultivated life" lean towards familiar constructions, but these are minor instances in an otherwise polished piece. There are no significant loops or scaffolding; the information density is high and the momentum is sustained.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density, with sentences that build character, atmosphere, and plot simultaneously. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, creating a tone of solemn grace. While the density of figurative language is very high and borders on overwriting in places ("celestial mathematics," "memory of endings"), it remains coherent and serves the story's mythic scope without collapsing into ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally demonstrates high information density. Lines like "a desperate science, a feeling more than a knowing" are precise and well-crafted. There are minor instances of stock phrasing, such as "heart hammering" or "the pieces assembling in his mind," that slightly dilute the otherwise strong craft. However, the overall execution is propulsive and free of significant loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, elegant, and demonstrates high information density. The rhythm and syntax effectively mirror the story's movements, from the sustained note of grief to the crescendo of insight. A minor deduction is warranted for a few sentences in the final paragraph that feel more like thematic scaffolding than visceral conclusion, slightly slowing the momentum of an otherwise sharp ending.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is clean, concise, and carries a high information density without feeling overwritten. Word choice is precise and evocative, especially in its descriptions of light and memory (“unspooled, a thin, radiant filament”). The story demonstrates excellent rhythmic control, and there are no distracting prose artifacts, loops, or scaffolding to impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. Momentum is excellent throughout. A minor deduction is warranted for a slight repetition during the climax where the "sandpapering" metaphor from the first paragraph is restated, momentarily flattening the prose in a peak moment of intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, it occasionally borders on being overwrought, with a high density of figurative language that can feel slightly self-conscious. Minor paraphrase loops, like "its descent arrested, its purpose unfulfilled," slightly impede the otherwise excellent momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery, especially in the opening and the vision sequence. The rhythm and syntax vary effectively to match the story's emotional current. While overwhelmingly strong, a few phrases like "psychic detritus" or "quaking reverie" feel slightly over-determined, a minor blemish on an otherwise excellent line-level execution.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, but it occasionally slips into overwriting and abstraction (e.g., "fragmented incoming data into spectral truths"). The final two paragraphs become overly declarative, summarizing the thematic stakes rather than embodying them in action or image. This shift to telling ("no longer potential but kinetic") slightly dulls the momentum of an otherwise sharp conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. Word choice is precise and evocative ("fissures like a map," "a feeling more than a sound"). The piece is free of line-level artifacts, loops, or overwriting. The final two sentences verge on telling ("It was a humble beginning..."), but it's a strategic summary that effectively frames the final, active choice, giving it greater weight and clarity rather than diminishing its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong imagery like "bleeding indigo into the charged air." Sentences are well-constructed and propel the narrative forward. The piece loses a step on some slightly stock phrasing ("hope in her eyes flickering," "swelling in his chest") and the final sentence, which reads more like an aphorism than a lived conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and largely concise, with strong, specific verbs and images. Information density is high, particularly in the description of the tuning process. The primary flaw is the single line of thematic summary near the end, a prose-level misstep that briefly replaces evocative craft with direct explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and specific sensory details. However, there are minor issues that prevent a higher score. A slight paraphrase loop appears in the climax ("not an attack; it was simply a fact... It was neither good nor bad, it just *was*"), which momentarily slows momentum. The final paragraph also contains summary-like statements that feel more like scaffolding than fully integrated prose.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is clean, clear, and contains striking imagery like the "petrified worms" of the rock arches. However, a few minor artifacts slightly dull its momentum. Phrases like "accelerates at a visible, impossible rate" are less dynamic than the surrounding prose, and the final paragraph's declarative sentences ("But Kaelen was changed. She had found the source...") feel like scaffolding rather than dramatized conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is largely stellar, with vivid, efficient descriptions. However, a few phrases like "the pieces... began to click into a terrifying whole" and "physics of doom" verge on cliché or melodrama, slightly dulling the otherwise sharp execution. These minor slips, while not touching the closure beat directly, prevent an otherwise exceptional piece from achieving flawless line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    The line-level craft is often beautiful, with evocative and precise phrasing ("sculpted hush," "liquid-gold"). However, there are moments of overwriting ("oscillating repose"), and the final paragraph engages in a paraphrase loop, restating the story's premise and outcome. This summary dulls the impact of the climax by telling the reader what was just powerfully shown, a notable artifact at the story's closure.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is often luminous, with striking images and a controlled rhythm. The primary flaw lies in the final two paragraphs, which devolve into summary and telling ("She had not fixed the past, but she had understood it," "Her motivation had been fulfilled"). This scaffolding replaces the momentum of dramatized experience with explanation, dulling the impact of the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is dense, polished, and displays a high level of craft, with strong verbs and specific, evocative imagery. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied, propelling the narrative forward with a controlled, deliberate momentum. While the language is consistently elevated and figurative, it generally avoids feeling overwritten because it serves the story's high-concept, fantastical premise. There are no notable loops, scaffolds, or artifacts; the execution is clean and professional.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and generally strong, with vivid imagery like hands that "fluttered like trapped moths." However, there are minor instances of telling over showing, such as explaining the transformation as "not destructive, but creative." While concise, these authorial intrusions slightly flatten the immediacy of otherwise powerful moments by summarizing their intent for the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is polished to a mirror finish. Word choice is precise and evocative ("feathery fractals," "luminous pieces"), and sentences are constructed with a powerful rhythm that supports the story's meditative, intense mood. There is no overwriting or scaffolding; every line carries weight, advancing character, atmosphere, or the central inquiry. The clarity and density of the language, especially in the final two paragraphs, are of the highest caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently beautiful, demonstrating strong rhythmic control. However, it suffers from a consistent density that borders on overwriting, and the repetition of the phrase "stoically sparkling" feels like a minor crutch. While the line-level craft is strong, a greater sense of economy would have elevated it further.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is generally clean and often elegant, but it is significantly weakened by summary and paraphrase loops in pivotal moments. The line "She had ventured into confusion and returned with understanding..." in the final paragraph explicitly restates the plot, undermining the power of the dramatized events and dulling the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and propulsive, with strong imagery and rhythm. The final paragraph, however, slightly falters by summarizing the thematic shift ("Her work was no longer about discovery. It was about completion."). This direct statement, while clear, is less powerful than the dramatized realization that precedes it, slightly diluting the impact of an otherwise masterful finish.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is polished to a high sheen, demonstrating exceptional clarity, concision, and momentum. Figurative language, such as "the sea’s whispers grew teeth" and "voice a rough stone in the quiet," is both original and perfectly suited to the tone. There are no wasted words, scaffold phrases, or textual loops; every sentence serves to advance character, atmosphere, or plot with high information density, meeting the 9+ standard for line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and demonstrates high information density. Imagery like "the rasp of a man who found cosmic absurdity in the gales he was bound to" is precise and powerful. The final paragraph leans slightly on telling ("had been accidentally prophetic"), where more immediate embodiment of the realization could have been stronger, but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise excellent execution.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density without feeling overwritten. Figurative language, such as "a still pond hiding a depth charge," is purposeful and sharp. The rhythm of the sentences effectively mirrors Hira's journey and internal state, creating momentum. The piece is free of loops, scaffolding, or other artifacts, presenting a polished and immersive reading experience from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, precise, and highly efficient. Word choice is consistently excellent ("quantified sorrow," "bruised evening sky," "vegetal sacrifice"), creating a dense, evocative texture without a single overwrought sentence. The rhythm and syntax support the story's momentum, building from the mundane to the miraculous with seamless control. There are no prose artifacts; every line serves a clear purpose in advancing atmosphere, character, or plot.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is generally elegant and clear, but its momentum is significantly harmed at a pivotal moment by a single sentence of abstract, diagnostic summary. The line "The feeling was one of profound bound release..." tells rather than shows, using label-like language that deflates the tension right before the final, more effective image. This prose artifact at a peak beat is a considerable flaw in an otherwise well-crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, with high information density and a varied, pleasing rhythm. Word choice is consistently strong and evocative. The only minor flaw is the repetition of the phrase "enlarged tranquility"—once to describe her life and again to describe the library. While potentially intentional, it reads as a slight echo rather than a purposeful, reweighted motif, constituting a minor loop that slightly dulls the otherwise pristine line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with a strong rhythm and precise word choice that carries the story's emotional weight. Momentum is well-paced, balancing description with action. A minor but notable prose artifact is the slightly academic phrase "heuristically gentle," which is repeated, creating a small register drift that momentarily pulls away from the otherwise seamless lyrical tone.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with strong imagery and a controlled, rhythmic cadence. However, a few minor artifacts prevent a higher score. The repetition of the phrase "gently meticulous" is noticeable, and the line "a timeframe that was both a description of her reality and a countdown to its end" feels slightly over-explained. These are small blemishes on an otherwise polished piece, but they momentarily break the spell of an exceptionally crafted narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished, evocative, and highly efficient. It balances lyrical description with sharp, kinetic action, and the rhythm modulates effectively to match the scene's tension. There are no discernible prose artifacts, loops, or redundancies; every line carries weight and propels the narrative forward with clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and evocative, with high information density in most lines. There is a slight tendency toward abstract summary at key moments of realization, such as "becoming a luminous acceptance of a pattern larger than logic," which tells rather than embodies the shift. While beautifully phrased, these instances slightly reduce the immediacy of the otherwise concrete and sensory-rich narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is lyrical and evocative, with strong sentence-level craft. However, there is a slight tendency toward overwriting in key emotional beats, where abstract descriptors are layered on top of each other. For instance, "an auroral sorrow—a deep, pervasive melancholy shot through with the faintest, most painful hint of hope" explains the concept rather than purely embodying it, creating a minor drag on momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and propulsive. Word choice is consistently strong, creating a distinct texture without overwriting ("ochre haze," "silted into dust," "a waterfall of whispered conversations"). The piece demonstrates high information density and rhythmic control, with no apparent scaffolding or redundancy, allowing the conceptual weight of the story to land with clarity and force.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is largely elegant, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Its rhythm supports the story's mythic tone. The score is slightly tempered by moments of abstraction, where thematic declarations like "the symphony of things as they were meant to be" replace more concrete, sensory description, particularly near the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly effective for most of the story. The language is both precise and evocative. A minor weakness appears in the final paragraph, which becomes slightly expository in summarizing the thematic resolution, momentarily losing the sharp, imagistic momentum that characterizes the climax. This brief slackening at the very end prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is largely excellent, with precise, evocative language ("particulate silence") and strong rhythmic control. The prose propels the narrative with clarity and grace. A minor deduction is warranted for a few phrases that feel slightly overwrought ("a path that leads through following") and for the final sentence, which functions as a piece of thematic scaffolding rather than a resonant final image.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and demonstrates high information density, with nearly every sentence advancing character, atmosphere, or plot. The rhythm is controlled, shifting gracefully between descriptive passages and moments of action. While the language is consistently elevated and conceptual, it avoids tipping into overwriting by remaining grounded in Elara’s specific perceptions and actions, resulting in a polished and propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density in most lines ("a tiny challenger to the dusk, now seemed to bleed light into a void"). There are no significant loops or artifacts, and the rhythm is controlled throughout. A minor deduction is applied for a few instances of efficient but slightly abstract summary, such as "a feeling of profound love that had been cleanly excised," which tells rather than embodies the feeling, momentarily thinning the otherwise rich texture.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is luminous and highly controlled, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, there is a slight tendency toward conceptual density that occasionally borders on abstraction, as in "terrestrially cosmic, a paradox of immense power." While the voice justifies this register, a few phrases feel more declared than embodied, a minor friction in an otherwise stellar performance. The final lines achieve a powerful, resonant clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant and highly polished, with high information density and evocative imagery. Sentences like "He spoke of lintels and cornices as if they were verbs and nouns" are exceptional. The piece is almost flawless, with strong rhythm and precise word choice. The single word "透明" (transparent) in the original text is a minor, ambiguous flourish that could be seen as slightly jarring, but it's not enough to significantly detract from the otherwise masterful line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative figurative language ("blossoms that felt like skin," "a harmonic that vibrated in Elara’s teeth"). Momentum is excellent until the resolution, where a few sentences paraphrase the thematic takeaway that was already powerfully shown. This minor scaffolding, while well-written, represents a slight redundancy that a final polish would remove.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. The rhythm and syntax support the solemn, focused atmosphere effectively. There is a minor tendency toward summary in the final paragraph, where sentences explain the thematic and emotional effects of the climax rather than letting the action and images carry the full weight alone.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is consistently clean, lyrical, and purposeful, with high information density in most lines. The rhythm and syntax support the story's solemn, wondrous atmosphere effectively. A handful of moments lean towards summary where dramatization would be stronger (e.g., "The shell’s whisper was a thread, and she was compelled to pull it"), preventing an otherwise excellent performance from reaching the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with high information density and strong, evocative word choices. The rhythm is well-paced, building a quiet, reverent momentum. A single sentence—"And she weaves truth carefully, for a misplaced assumption could..."—reads as a slight authorial intrusion that tells the reader the stakes of her work rather than letting the scene show it, a minor blemish on otherwise polished craft.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with many beautiful lines. However, the penultimate paragraph functions as summary and scaffolding ("Lin finally understood. The audacity was not..."). This explicit explanation of the theme's nuances is a prose artifact that preempts and slightly dulls the impact of the story's powerful final image, a notable flaw that holds it back.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is clean, confident, and possesses a high information density without feeling overwritten. Sentences like "The world after the liquidation was a tapestry of comfortable lies stretched over ugly truths" establish character, setting, and theme with remarkable efficiency. The rhythm is well-paced, accelerating with the storm and slowing for the final, quiet decision. There are no notable prose artifacts or momentum-dulling loops.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and evocative, with powerful imagery throughout. Sentences are well-crafted for rhythm and momentum. The score is held just shy of the 9-band by a few slightly generic phrases in moments of high interiority, such as "a tear in his very soul," which momentarily flatten the otherwise specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and concise, with strong imagery and a varied sentence rhythm that propels the narrative. Word choice is generally precise and evocative. The primary flaw is a tendency toward summary and abstraction in the final paragraph ("no longer just a translator, but a conduit"), which functions as scaffolding that slightly dulls the impact of the otherwise powerful final image.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative ("skeletal lighthouse," "dissonant groans," "clicking harmony"), creating a strong atmosphere with great economy. There are no notable scaffold phrases or loops. Sentences are varied in structure, carrying the narrative forward with a confident rhythm. A minor echo in the final paragraph ("absolved the ice") slightly duplicates the core concept but is a very small flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished to a high sheen, demonstrating exceptional clarity, concision, and momentum. Word choice is precise and evocative ("mercury-bright gleam," "slough away"), and the sentence structure varies to control rhythm in step with the narrative's building tension. There are no wasted words or line-level artifacts; every sentence serves to heighten atmosphere or advance the internal state.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong, evocative imagery ("calculated silence," "forgotten artery"). There are, however, a few moments of abstract phrasing, such as "a single record of the struggle to break free from a controlling influence," that feel slightly less grounded than the surrounding text. The final paragraph’s shift into direct thematic statement also flattens the prose rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and sensory detail. However, the final two paragraphs exhibit some flaws that dull the story's sharpest edge. There is a paraphrase loop ("not just built a heart; he had built a testament") followed by an overly didactic thematic statement. These prose artifacts in the crucial closure scene slightly reduce momentum and clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished, dense, and evocative, with strong verbs and specific, memorable imagery ("skimmed the bubbling surface of the acid sea"). There are no technical flaws, loops, or redundancies. The only minor weakness is the paragraph explaining the algorithm's meaning, which functions as a concentrated information dump. While elegantly phrased, it tells rather than shows at a pivotal moment, briefly slowing the propulsive momentum leading into the final action.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is clean, efficient, and demonstrates strong momentum. Sentences are well-constructed and information-dense, particularly in the final, revelatory paragraphs. There are a few instances of minor redundancy ("a lie, a carefully constructed fiction") and slight cliché ("crystallized, sharp and clear"), which are the only elements holding it back from the highest echelon. Overall, the line-level craft is very strong and serves the story's propulsive mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.8)
    The prose is generally clear and competent, but it relies on strategic summary at a pivotal moment. The choice to narrate the village's defense ("They built barricades, dug diversion channels...") rather than showing the chaotic, desperate action is a significant loss of momentum. Additionally, some figurative language feels decorative ("shadow-laced," "weighted breath") rather than essential.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise for the most part, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery. The sentence structure varies effectively, creating a rhythm that supports the story's contemplative pace. The final paragraph, while thematically coherent, has a few phrases ("continuous, beautiful cascade," "wind's solacing hymn") that feel slightly less sharp and more summative than the prose that precedes them, slightly dulling the impact of the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density in its descriptions. Lines like "a silence so profound it felt like a new element" are superb. There are, however, minor instances of overwriting where figurative language becomes slightly too ornate or familiar, such as "conflagration of the heart," which momentarily breaks the story's otherwise subtle texture.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and highly evocative, with high information density in nearly every line. The rhythm and syntax support the story's calm-to-tense-to-resolved arc beautifully. While the brief explanation of the kinetic parapet is a moment of pure exposition, it is handled with efficiency and is essential for the climax, making it a justified and well-executed choice within a piece devoid of other artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prose is clean, clear, and generally well-crafted, with strong imagery in the middle sections. The primary weakness is a tendency toward summary and abstraction in the final two paragraphs. Phrases like "potent, magical warmth" and "a perfect, perceptively calm conclusion" label the emotional takeaway for the reader rather than allowing it to be fully embodied by the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and a controlled rhythm. The line-level craft is mostly flawless, though a few phrases lean toward being slightly overwritten (e.g., "the cynical dust of her academic isolation wiped clean"). The final paragraph also contains a sentence that feels more like scaffolding for the theme than a continuation of the scene's momentum, slightly dulling the impact of an otherwise resonant ending.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and meticulously crafted, with high information density in every line. While highly figurative, the language serves the story’s atmospheric and thematic goals rather than feeling ornamental, and it maintains clarity throughout. The sentence structure is varied, word choice is precise and striking ("a cello string bowed by time itself"), and there are no discernible prose artifacts or loops to break the momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, precise, and propulsive. Sentences are crafted with a strong sense of rhythm and information density, particularly in the opening and closing paragraphs. There are no notable prose artifacts; word choice is specific and evocative (e.g., "shattering permanence," "cacophony of collapse"), and the story avoids overwriting, allowing the final quiet moment to land with maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and rhythmic, with high information density in most lines. There is a slight flaw in the concluding paragraphs, where the prose shifts from showing to summarizing the events ("She had used every part of her craft..."). This moment of telling, while emotionally true, is a minor prose artifact that slightly dulls the otherwise pristine closure by explaining what the preceding scene so powerfully dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is generally clean, elegant, and carries a strong rhythm. However, a few moments lean towards direct explanation rather than evocative imagery, particularly in the climax ("The projection displayed reality itself..."). Some phrasing, like "release of pent-up potential," feels slightly generic compared to the specificity elsewhere. These instances slightly soften the impact of key beats but do not obscure clarity or momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("a fountain that wept iron-rich water"). The rhythm and sentence structure vary effectively to match the story's emotional beats. There are a couple of phrases, like "nostalgic innovation," that feel slightly abstract and less grounded than the surrounding prose, momentarily pulling the reader out of the immediate sensory experience. These are minor but prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with strong imagery like "a solid tear" and "It didn’t blaze; it breathed." Momentum is well-maintained through varied sentence structures. The primary weakness is a handful of phrases that tell rather than show the intended effect, such as "It was not a transformation, but a revelation," which feels like a slight authorial scaffold. This minor slip in an otherwise pristine piece is what holds it back from a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a controlled rhythm. The line-level craft is generally excellent, creating a palpable atmosphere. A few phrases, such as "weaving around them, healing the broken frequencies of the past," lean slightly into abstraction and feel less grounded than the rest of the piece. This minor overwriting at the very end prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is elegant and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there are moments, particularly around the epiphany, that lean into writerly cliché ("The story unspooled in his mind, clear and vital"). The high density of figurative language occasionally borders on being overwritten, slightly softening the impact of the otherwise sharp line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is elegant and clear, with many powerful images. However, a few minor flaws prevent a top-tier score, such as the redundant sentence "This was her purpose" and the use of the common cliché "breath caught in her throat" during the peak moment. While the overall execution is very strong, these small slips slightly dull the polish expected for immediate publication.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is overwhelmingly strong, with high information density and rhythmic control. However, the piece is marred by a single, jarring text artifact: the random insertion of a Chinese character in the phrase "old 英雄ic outlines." For a publication of the highest standard, such a typographical error is a significant flaw that breaks immersion at a key moment, preventing an otherwise near-perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly polished, with a strong rhythmic quality that supports the story's focus on sound. Figurative language, such as "harvest of echoes" and "blueprint of sound," is both inventive and precise, enhancing the core concepts without overwriting. There is no wasted language; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or the steady propulsion of the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and polished, marked by striking and original figurative language ("a roof of overlapping feathers," "whalebone reverie"). Sentences are constructed with rhythmic variety and high information density, advancing atmosphere and action simultaneously. Even during the high-pressure climax, the figurative language ("turning to marble") sharpens the stakes rather than obscuring them. The piece is free of loops or scaffolding, showcasing a very high level of line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, varied sentence rhythm, and powerful, organic figurative language ("his absence had its own weather"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The writing is clear, propulsive, and polished to a degree that is immediately publishable.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, clear, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery that carries the story's emotional weight. The rhythm is controlled, particularly in the use of the repeated "Click." A few lines, such as "This was the erosion; not a diminishing of desire, but the realization that it had been misdirected all along," lean toward summary rather than dramatization, slightly flattening the prose in that moment, but the overall craft is of a very high caliber.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong imagery and varied sentence structures. The rhythm and clarity are excellent. The score is slightly tempered by the recurrence of the "equations for hope" phrase, which functions as a thematic label and feels less organic than the surrounding prose, particularly in its final appearance where it borders on summary.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, but a minor artifact slightly mars its surface. The phrase "excruciatingly gentle" is used to describe both Elara's touch and the bear's gaze, a repetition of a highly specific adverb that feels like an oversight in a piece this short. While the overall craft is very strong, this echo prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, several line-level artifacts appear in the crucial final paragraph, dulling the impact of the closure. The paraphrase loop in "The clarity that washed over him was a thing of hindsight clarity" and the slight redundancy of "his thoughts became thoughtfully clear" are noticeable slips in an otherwise polished piece, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is elegant and evocative, with strong sensory details and a confident rhythm. However, there are a few moments where it drifts toward abstraction and risks overwriting, such as the direct explanation in the second paragraph ("she harvested understanding from the physical world"). While the figurative language is generally strong ("ridged canyons"), a slight tightening to ground every concept in a concrete image would elevate it further. No significant loops or artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with a masterful control of rhythm and imagery. The sentences are crafted with precision, achieving both clarity and atmospheric weight without a single wasted word. While the density of figurative language is high, it remains coherent and purposeful, never slipping into overwriting, and directly serves the story's tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive. Word choice is precise and evocative, creating a strong sense of place and mood without overwriting. Sentence structure varies to control rhythm, moving from descriptive passages to the "frantic, focused time" of creation. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible scaffolding, loops, or artifacts to dull its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, concise, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific, sensory nouns. Sentences are crafted with a clear rhythm that supports the story's quiet, intense atmosphere. There is a high information density, with nearly every line advancing character, setting, or action. While a few declarative sentences verge on summary ("This was her method, her alchemy"), they are brief and do not create momentum drag or significant artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, polished, and highly effective. Word choice is precise and evocative, with strong verbs and specific nouns carrying the narrative weight. Figurative language is rich but never overwrought, consistently serving the story's tone and atmosphere. There are no wasted sentences; the piece exhibits high information density and rhythmic control from the opening line to the resonant final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and demonstrates high information density, with images often performing thematic and narrative work simultaneously. However, there are minor instances of near-redundancy that slightly soften the propulsion, such as "a duty passed down, a generational pattern," where the phrases are conceptually close. While the overall effect is powerful, a final polish to eliminate these trace echoes would elevate it to exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with high information density. However, there are minor areas that could be tightened. The final paragraph relies on a slightly repetitive sentence structure ("He would... He would...") that reads like a template cadence. While the overall effect is strong, these small moments of less-than-perfect propulsion keep it from the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and highly evocative, with strong verbs and specific imagery ("jagged, glassy expanse," "measured counter-rhythm"). Sentence structure is varied and supports the story's deliberate pacing. There are moments of high abstraction, particularly in the opening, but they serve to establish the mythic tone without impeding momentum or clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and highly evocative, with strong verbs and carefully chosen imagery. However, there is a slight tendency towards dense, stacked figurative language that can feel overwrought at times (e.g., "velveteen gloom, soft and all-encompassing"). Some phrases, like "motes of dust dancing," verge on the cliché. While the line-level craft is very strong overall, these minor instances of aesthetic excess hold it back from true perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.5)
    While often elegant, the prose is hampered by moments of abstraction and authorial intrusion. The use of abstract jargon ("sociological shift vectors"), stock metaphors ("theater of his mind"), and phrases that directly echo the story's conceptual elements ("sustaining transformation") weaken the line-level execution and detract from the otherwise strong voice and immersive world.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, rhythmic, and often beautiful. However, a few moments slip into elegant abstraction where concrete detail would be stronger, notably the summary of a weeks-long process as teaching the dust "the architecture of emotion." While a lovely phrase, it tells instead of shows at a pivotal moment, preventing a higher score. No significant loops or artifacts are present.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is polished, elegant, and dense with meaning. Word choice is precise ("granular grit," "plumed across the drawing"). The primary flaw is a minor tendency toward didacticism in the fourth paragraph, where the narration explains the theme ("The portrait suggested a solidity, a permanence that was a lie") rather than letting the action and imagery carry the full weight. This brief instance of telling over showing is the only thing holding the line-level craft back from true perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is clear, concise, and carries strong momentum. However, there is a recurring pattern of declarative, summary-like statements at key moments, particularly the climactic realization ("The plague had not ended a decadent civilization; it had finished off a wounded one."). This strategic telling is efficient but slightly undercuts the immediacy of the discovery, replacing in-the-moment synthesis with a polished conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is luminous, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic control without a single misstep. Word choices like "traveled stillness" and "shimmering braid of tone" are both beautiful and precise. The story avoids all common prose artifacts; there are no loops, scaffold phrases, or mixed metaphors, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and deeply resonant read.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is largely elegant and evocative, but its momentum is periodically stalled by expository scaffolding at key moments. Sentences like "designed to unlock not just the past, but the future of a palate" and the summary of her grandfather's belief tell the reader the theme directly. This robs the climax and resolution of their full power by explaining what should be dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is largely elegant and precise, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, a few moments slip into less polished territory. The final paragraph contains the line, "...but he had given it back its life, its wonder," which verges on summarizing the theme too explicitly. This slightly undermines the powerful subtlety of the final image, preventing the prose from achieving flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, controlled, and demonstrates a high level of craft, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences are rhythmically varied, creating a momentum that feels both gentle and purposeful, like the waves on the shore. While a few phrases verge on the familiar ("lumber and nail"), the overall execution is sharp, with high information density and no significant artifacts to stall the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and rhythmically controlled, with each sentence carrying significant weight. Figurative language, such as the telepathic message being a "needle" and the burst of light a "silent supernova," is evocative and precise. The one minor weakness is the repetition of the phrase "cascading revelation." While it serves as an intentional echo, a different phrasing for the second instance might have felt stronger and less like a reused scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, precise, and evocative, with a high degree of information density in every line. The language is sophisticated without becoming overwrought, using conceptual vocabulary ("axiomatic structure," "exogenous variable") that enhances character and theme. The climax is described with stunning economy and power in "The sound was of twisting geometry," demonstrating supreme confidence and craft.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("night-blooming silence," "grammar of starlight"). The rhythm is controlled, creating a contemplative momentum that fits the story's tone perfectly. There are no significant line-level artifacts or overwriting. The only minor weakness is the final sentence, which opts for a declarative summary over a more resonant, imagistic closing.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is elegant and confident, marked by high information density and striking, original phrasing ("rosewater dread," "a void that echoed a deeper loss"). The rhythm and syntax modulate effectively with the scene's pressure, accelerating during the climb and breathing in the final moments of resolve. There are no discernible loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles, resulting in a clean, propulsive, and highly polished read.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and immaculately controlled. Striking and original phrases like "subtractive light that drank the shadows" and "sinking upwards into a reversal of their plunge" demonstrate a high level of craft without becoming overwrought. The rhythm and syntax escalate with the tension of the scene, moving from measured description to a breathless climax and a final, stark cadence that mirrors the emptiness of the new reality. There are no wasted words or line-level artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is evocative and precise, with strong sensory details and rhythmic control. Two minor issues prevent a higher score: the repetition of the phrase "repulsive allure," and a final paragraph that summarizes the thematic resolution rather than letting the climactic action stand on its own. This slight redundancy at the very end dulls an otherwise sharp landing.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is rich and evocative, with strong verbs and a compelling rhythm. However, there is a recurring tendency towards overwriting, particularly with dense, abstract phrases ("the sketched resonance of the world's deep music") and stacked figurative language that can slightly impede momentum. While often beautiful, the line-level craft occasionally prioritizes lyricism over the immediate, visceral clarity required by the scene's pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and demonstrates high information density, especially in the opening paragraphs. The rhythm is well-paced, creating momentum without feeling rushed. A minor slip into cliché with "Understanding bloomed within her" is the only element preventing a higher score, as it momentarily flattens the voice during a peak moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is clean, clear, and often elegant, with strong metaphors like "cathedral of neglect" and "glacier of focus." Momentum is well-maintained, and the sentences are purposeful. A few phrases verge on the familiar ("messy turbulence of sentiment") and some internal realizations are summarized with a bit too much neatness, but these are minor issues in an otherwise polished piece.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong imagery and rhythmic control ("the sea sucking greedily at his boots"). However, there are minor instances of overwriting or cliché that hold it back from perfection. Phrases like "a crack in the dam" and abstract labels like "stoically sensitive constitution" feel less fresh than the surrounding descriptions, creating small bumps in an otherwise smooth and evocative surface.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is clean, evocative, and propulsive for the most part, with strong verbs and varied sentence structures. The rhythm and clarity are high. The score is slightly lowered by isolated instances of overwriting, such as the abstract description of "dappled resolve, a patchwork of absolute determination," which momentarily stalls the momentum with conceptual summary.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, polished, and possesses a high information density, with strong verbs and specific imagery. It walks a fine line with its lyrical richness, occasionally bordering on overwriting, but the figurative language consistently serves the story’s atmosphere and emotional core. There are no technical flaws, loops, or scaffold, resulting in a clean, propulsive read.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic precision, and powerful, uncluttered imagery. Sentences like "He was a man defined by an absence, a ghost who had walked away from the shower of fire and confetti" are both economical and deeply evocative. There are no loops, scaffolding, or figurative muddles; every word serves to advance the story's atmospheric and emotional momentum toward its resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.0)
    The prose is often luminous, particularly in the opening paragraph's description of the observatory. However, there are minor weaknesses in the final third. The line "And she understood" is a common narrative shortcut, and the final paragraph contains some conceptual redundancy, slightly over-explaining the transformation instead of letting the final powerful image do all the work. This slight loss of momentum at the very end holds it back.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and evocative, precise language. Phrases like "a wave of tempered regret, hot and sharp" and "the water a slab of dark glass" are vivid and efficient. The prose is entirely free of loops, scaffolding, or mixed metaphors, demonstrating a polish and control that is ready for publication.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is clean and often elegant, with strong sensory details in the opening. The rhythm is well-controlled. The primary flaw is a minor but noticeable tendency toward conceptual redundancy, especially near the end. Lines like “The lesson was the wisdom, and the wisdom was to move on” state the same idea twice in a slightly circular way, a prose artifact that momentarily dulls the propulsion toward the final, potent image.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is elegant, rhythmic, and dense with meaning. However, the inexplicable inclusion of the Chinese characters "静止" is a jarring text artifact that breaks immersion and clarity in an otherwise flawless piece. This single, significant blemish is the primary reason the score is not higher, as it requires the reader to either guess the meaning or leave the text to look it up, disrupting the narrative flow at a key moment.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. Sentences like "memories intact but hollow, like a museum exhibit behind glass, felt but not felt" show high-level craft. There is a slight tendency toward ornamental prose ("the jeep kicking up plumes of ancient regret"), and some descriptions are dense with modifiers. However, the writing maintains clarity and propulsion, and key phrases like "delicately robust" are repeated with purpose, demonstrating careful control.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    The line-level craft is strong, with evocative imagery and a smooth, confident rhythm. Sentences like "its branches heavy with fruit that shone like captured stars" demonstrate high quality. The primary weakness is a slight tendency toward abstract, conceptual language ("cosmic intimacy," "pure potential") that can feel overwrought and momentarily pulls away from the concrete sensory details that otherwise ground the story.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and largely flawless. Word choice is precise and evocative ("onyx-ink," "silver vapor," "gilded center"). The high density of figurative language in the opening paragraphs is a risk, but here it successfully establishes the tone and world without becoming overwrought or obscuring meaning. The piece demonstrates excellent sentence-level propulsion and avoids any loops or scaffolding, moving with a confident and lyrical momentum from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and purposeful, with very few wasted words. The line-level craft is strong, using evocative and precise language to build atmosphere and convey complex ideas concisely ("a ghost ship carrying a ghost made anchor"). While the figurative language is consistently high-register, it remains coherent and avoids muddling the peak moments, instead enhancing the story’s mythic quality. There are no notable loops or scaffolding to weaken momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.0)
    The prose is clean and competent but lacks exceptional sharpness or momentum. There is a tendency toward abstract nouns and telling over showing, particularly in the setup and conclusion ("a profound, unquenchable need to understand the texture of transformation"). While grammatically sound, the sentence structures are not varied enough to create a dynamic rhythm, and some figurative language feels slightly overworn ("roaring river," "fiery heart").

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, with strong verbs and high information density ("a study in quiet purpose"). However, it occasionally tips into slightly overwrought territory with phrases that feel like familiar genre beats ("cradle of sparks," "hammered into being"). The repetition of "winking hush" is a minor but noticeable echo that slightly dulls the otherwise excellent final line, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, concise, and demonstrates high information density. Word choices like "hungry luminescence" and the concept of being "unraveled" are precise and evocative. There are no notable loops, scaffold, or syntactic monotony; the sentences propel the narrative forward with a controlled, confident rhythm, especially in the high-pressure climax.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propulsive, with strong verbs and evocative imagery ("Lightening veined the clouds"). Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to match the pacing of the scene, particularly in the staccato rendering of the timer's clicks. While a few phrases verge on the familiar ("architecture of a life"), the overall craft is superb, with no distracting loops or artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished, precise, and often beautiful, with a varied rhythm that matches the action's tempo. Sentences are information-dense and evocative without significant overwriting. The language consistently supports the story's high-concept premise, creating a world that feels both logical and poetic without any noticeable loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prose is ambitious, with many striking phrases and a strong command of imagery. However, it is hampered by a tendency toward overwriting in key moments. The final paragraph, in particular, becomes a summary of its own themes ("mended not with gold, but with trust, and words..."), explaining the story's meaning to the reader instead of allowing the final image to resonate on its own. This explicit statement of theme dulls the impact of an otherwise powerful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is generally lush and evocative, with strong imagery and rhythm. However, it is marred by a few instances of authorial intrusion and telling over showing. The line "Her solution was strategically creative, using art to solve a problem of science" is an on-the-nose thematic summary that breaks the narrative spell and slightly dulls the momentum leading into the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is polished and evocative, with a strong sense of rhythm and high information density. Word choice is precise and imaginative ("sky deepened from blue to bruised purple"). The sentences propel the narrative forward while simultaneously building a rich atmosphere. The writing is free of loops or distracting artifacts, demonstrating a high level of line-level craft that is clean, clear, and elegant.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is polished and often beautiful, marked by high information density and strong, evocative imagery ("her voice a low tide"). The rhythm is controlled and supports the placid yet turbulent emotional landscape. A minor deduction is warranted for a few instances of summary and explanation that function as scaffolding, such as the sentence beginning "He understood now that...", which tells the reader the meaning of the metaphor just demonstrated.


== Grader: Grok 4 ==
  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "speck of organized dust," though minor figurative stacking in the wing description slightly muddles without harming clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like "fine, grey dust of charcoal," and rhythm varies naturally, accelerating in the climb. Minor artifacts include a paraphrase loop in the frost discovery ("weren't random; they seemed almost… deliberate") and template cadence in reflective blocks, but they don't obscure closure. Figurative language is controlled without muddle, though one mixed metaphor ("hollow echo that somehow soothed the sharp edges") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    Prose is concise with high density, varying rhythm naturally and advancing atmosphere through images like "visual scream"; no loops, scaffolds, or artifacts obscure clarity; figurative language integrates without muddle, as in frost's harmonic sympathy; final line recharges motifs with propulsion.

Information propels forward, with vivid verbs and specifics replacing generics; no artifacts obscure closure, and the final line resolves by recharging the bell motif. Figurative language is controlled, purposeful, and coherent in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose is concise with high density, advancing atmosphere through vivid images like glycerin tear and coiling fog, varying rhythm naturally without loops or scaffold; sentences propel from memory surfacing to final stars.

    Zero loops; "sodden, silent world" and "luminous dust" exemplify high-density specificity. Figurative language ("dust held secrets of gravity") serves theme without muddling. Final paragraph's cadence accelerates perfectly into closure with "fractures and luminous dust" reprise.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minimal scaffold—only "steadily adaptive" repetition weakens momentum. Final line’s propulsion flawless, but adjacent synonym loops ("slow repair," "slow, patient archaeology") trigger −0.3 per Q7 artifact rules.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line multi-tasks (e.g., "bone-deep hum" conveys silence + vibration). Final paragraph's "spirals" creates visual rhythm matching theme, with no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.1)
    Near-flawless propulsion ("books floated... pages moving like gentle breath"), but slight paraphrase loop in "drowned and eternal, silent yet screaming" deducts; zero artifacts in closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "practiced, soundless efficiency" shows rather than tells. High density with "ancient clay pillars weathered to dusk" doing triple duty. Final line's cadence shift ("prepare to declare... give them a different story") propels closure without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.4)
    Zero loops, high density ("tear of glycerin and glass rolled down the goddess’s stone cheek"), but "torrent of boundless, unconditional compassion" edges toward overwriting in climax. Final line ("stars appeared... clear and bright") propels closure cleanly. Minor register drift in "profound" weakens peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.6)
    Strong propulsion until sentry confrontation where "snapping across the floor" and "deafening shriek" create simultaneity error; minor paraphrase loop in "staggering grace" descriptions dulls peak-beat clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.9)
    Zero loops; "desolate, silent white" does triple duty as sensory, emotional, and conceptual image. Final line’s reprise of "battered marvel" avoids scaffold by charging closure with earned cost—no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Luminous disbelief" borders on abstraction but is redeemed by "jar clutched tight" physicality. Minor overwriting ("buttery, dying glow") in one beat; no loops or scaffold. Final line’s "heard its song" propels closure with zero drag.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose sings in dive sequence ("black water a void," "feeble beam through murk"), but Chinese characters in "潮汐-like whisper" create clarity break. Minor paraphrase loop ("trembling with certainty") avoids closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.8)
    Adjacent synonym loops ("ambered hush... marbled hush... profound stillness") and mixed metaphor ("resinous, trapping") in closure beat dull immediacy; high density elsewhere insufficient to offset final-third artifacts.

    Zero paraphrase loops with high density, but "thundering calm" and "river of Monarchs" risk stacked metaphors in high-pressure beat; strategic telling in backstory avoids momentum loss, final line charges closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.6)
    Near-flawless propulsion with varied syntax ("His duty was his identity..."), but "searing reverie" and "ghostly guidance" risk abstraction in high-pressure beats. Final image ("tides receded with a gentle, orderly swish") achieves crystalline clarity without scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops, but "knotted, colored silks... fractured from its story" overwrites tension; near-closure metaphor dilutes propulsion without harming final image's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("calculated the precise stress points where a known alloy would fail") propels momentum. Figurative language sparse and purposeful ("tangled forest of outcomes"); final line crystallizes theme without muddle. One comma splice ("kingfisher’s, feather") costs 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.9)
    Near-flawless propulsion with high density; "silver powder coated a stone shelf" exemplifies textural specificity. One paraphrase loop ("her work was precision, her life was quiet") in opening slightly dulls momentum but doesn’t touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "plumed across the drawing, the fine particles settling... merging... blurring" achieves crystalline density in the closure beat without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "silt and silence" to "furious peace" shows rhythmic control. Figurative language ("clock of history") serves closure without muddle. Final line’s propulsion—"turned and began his descent back home, to write"—avoids overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=9.7)
    Near-flawless propulsion; minor paraphrase loop ("quiet erasure of one more vanishing art, a subtraction from the world’s dwindling harmony") slightly dilutes density in a high-pressure beat, costing 0.3 per Overwriting Checks.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor density issues: "luminous, pearlescent orb" risks purple prose; "synaptic plasticity" feels un-POV. No loops, but final paragraph’s "joyous taste of her own future" edges toward abstraction without sensory anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=9.1)
    Zero loops or scaffold; propulsion via concrete verbs ("swept," "unrolled"). Final line "it was enough" delivers closure with crystalline simplicity. Minor register drift in "auxiliary power" lexicon, but no figurative muddle in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "velvet blanket" metaphor coherent under pressure; final line recharges "noticer" motif with perfect propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every line propels the climax. The "silent supernova" metaphor crystallizes the ampoule’s rupture without muddle, and the final sentence’s rhythmic cadence ("threading their way through the broken dome") elevates closure without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density ("a grim optimist, a woman who saw the elegant misery of her prison"). "Twisting geometry" avoids mixed metaphor. Final line’s cadence ("chose a direction to walk") resolves momentum without overwriting. Minor cadence dip in "epochs" reflection, but within BRR allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero closure artifacts; "thriving saffron crocus" crystallizes final image. Minor synonym loop ("hollow stillness"/"stagnant slumber") costs 0.1 but avoids momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; "roaring, blinding force" propels momentum. "Rosewater dread" repetition in Q7 is minor paraphrase but closure image ("endless, empty ocean") remains razor-sharp. Figurative language stays earned in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean propulsion overall, but paraphrase loop in closure beat ("air grew thin and stale, the oxygen unraveling") dulls the catastrophe's immediacy; disallowed 9+ due to artifact in final third.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops; "lingering luminance" and "discarded opera cloak clasp" achieve high density; final line recharges motifs without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.8)
    Prose propulsion excels with "mallet a blur" kinetic phrasing. Minor deduction for "restless euphony" repetition (words 112/287) without significant evolution—slight loop in peak beat.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "sun-bleached salt flats" to "blinding dawn" creates textural propulsion. Figurative language sparse but potent ("dread washed in rising sun"). Closure beat crystalline.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.5)
    No loops or scaffold, but "fragile, beautiful letter" generic descriptor. Final line risks cliché ("into the light") yet saved by context. Strong propulsion via concrete verbs ("shedding petals," "wove a counter-narrative"). Minor overwriting in "glacier of focus" metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Minor density issue: "skeletal stone ribs" and "bones of a forgotten leviathan" verge on redundant imagery in a high-pressure beat. Otherwise, propulsion remains strong with zero loops; final line’s "quiet, devoted librarians" delivers crystalline closure without muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.5)
    Zero loops; high density in "each crease was a goodbye" compression. Slight figurative muddle in "void so profound it felt louder than any noise" but no closure impact. Strategic telling compresses ascent.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "symphony of overlapping, half-seen frequencies" exemplifies high-density propulsion where every phrase multiplies meaning; final line’s "invisible spectrum" recharges the geode motif without figurative muddle.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Dust motes dancing like slow-motion fireworks" creates a mixed metaphor (fireworks imply speed), slightly muddling density. Otherwise, propulsion is relentless—"shuddering scream of unoiled metal" merges action/image—though "conceptually" risks elevated diction in high-pressure alignment beat.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero loops or scaffold; every sentence multiplies meaning: "water a slab of dark glass" establishes tone, setting, and emotion simultaneously. Figurative language appears sparingly in high-pressure beats (only one metaphor during crisis). Final line’s "foundation, not a tomb" avoids cliché through concrete contrast, propelling closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.6)
    "Furrowed hush" repeats in para 1 (synonym loop), slightly dulling immediacy. Otherwise flawless propulsion: "tarnished brass, intricately carved" shows specificity; final line’s "mist began to thin" avoids overwriting while charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor scaffold in "flickering faith" recurrence (paras 4-5) creates subtle paraphrase loop; otherwise high density with propulsion, but final image clarity loses 0.1 due to near-redundant phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zero loops; high density with propulsion ("jeep kicking up plumes of ancient regret"). "Delicately robust" metaphor avoids muddle by concretely charging lake/closure. Final line’s "glowed on, delicately robust" crystallizes thematic weight without overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.6)
    Minor paraphrase loop: "choking beauty" appears twice in proximity (para 1 & 4); no closure damage but dulls momentum—otherwise high density with concrete propulsion ("ink raced along the fracture").

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "gravitational anchor" metaphor deepens without muddying. Minor overwriting ("faint shimmer of long-dried tears") risks density but pays off in tear’s payoff. Final line’s cadence perfectly recharges "ghost ship" motif.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Zero loops or scaffold; final image ("warm sand... smooth and perfect") achieves crystalline specificity. Minor overwriting in setup ("roaring river... dry earth") slightly dilutes momentum, but closure beat avoids figurative muddle, meeting the 9+ quick test threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.8)
    Zero paraphrase loops; "winking, luminous hush" finale charges closure with rhythmic propulsion and crystalline specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Zero scaffold or loops; "pressure that made his teeth ache" and "dissolved into the light" exemplify high-density propulsion, though "river of possible futures" slightly edges toward stock metaphor without muddying the closure beat's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.3)
    "Cartography of scars" triggers Patterned-artifact penalty (-0.4) as therapy-speak in peak beat, but no loops or scaffold. Prose otherwise achieves high density ("ghosts of words began to appear") with closure image sharpened by concrete verbs.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "gleaming steel that was both violent and supremely elegant" exemplifies high-density prose. Final image propulsion is flawless, though "diplomatically fierce" slightly drifts into label-speak before earning embodiment at the foil retrieval.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    Zero loops; "satchel made of patchwork scraps" shows not tells. Minor paraphrase in "rebuilding what system discarded" → "rebuild world within world" costs 0.3. Closure image ("awaited the dawn") crystal-clear.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.3)
    Zero loops and high density, yet "steely longing" cliché and conductor’s corporate diction ("strategically creative") create minor register drift in high-pressure beats.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.6)
    Zero loops or scaffold; "golden light radiated outward" crystallizes closure with textural precision. Minor deduction for triple repetition of "luminous doubt" slightly diluting peak-beat density.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.4)
    Zero loops or scaffold; high density in "luminous grey of dawn horizon, gentle green of new leaf" doing triple duty. No figurative muddle—"tarnished brass" and "healed scar" metaphors stay concrete. Final line’s "rhythmically placid islet held him" propels closure without overwriting.
