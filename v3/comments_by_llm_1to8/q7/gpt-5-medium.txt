  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"She was a neutron star researcher whose models once threw flamboyant fireworks at data, until the river argued for simpler mathematics." Some repetitive structures appear ("She would," "They would"), and abstract phrases like "kindled humility" and "theater of prediction" create minor register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Song nested in stone, then rose, then braided"). Some metaphoric density in middle sections ("tiny drought of soot") occasionally obscures momentum. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that track the discovery process.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The forks themselves are inert now, their teeth like antlers caught perpetually before the strike." Some minor repetition of "unshaken marvels" and occasional abstract phrasing ("nation of wrong readings") slightly dulls momentum but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The city sits three streets below the harbor, a skeleton of boulevards sealed in glass domes and regret"). Some metaphor density in peak beats ("chased stillness," "mantled thing") but pattern-taught and coherent. Minor scaffold in "I realize" construction but momentum remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("rust-red rib cage against the moon") but occasional abstraction ("scarcity, when braided with care, could become a braid strong enough to lift a season") and metaphor strain. Some template phrasing in middle sections ("We organized through...," "We discovered that...") creates mild drumbeat effect.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("vines had flowered in improbable constellations") though occasional overwriting appears ("pilgrim of sparks walking inside the lens"). Some therapy-speak intrudes ("where the remainder goes when a feeling is not spent") but doesn't touch closure. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, though a few paraphrase loops appear mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract philosophizing dilute momentum ("Forgiveness is a labyrinth too, one that returns you to the first question"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, and occasional register drift into elevated diction. The final line effectively recharges earlier motifs despite these friction points.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with most lines carrying multiple functions (action, atmosphere, theme). Syntactic variety creates natural rhythm without template patterns. Deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("futures poured through the breach") and one instance of near-paraphrase ("patient strategy"/"patiently strategic").

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"shells cling to twigs and remember storms by salted scars" advances setting, method, and theme simultaneously. However, abstract phrases like "impact of memories is not just weight but tone" and "mitosis of faith" create opacity in peak beats, and some conceptual redundancy appears in the middle third where the forgework could compress.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid images ("moths stitched our way with translucence"). However, abstract phrases accumulate ("luminous disbelief," "tender, ruinous gratitude," "unspent horizon") creating occasional opacity. Some filter constructions ("I felt," "I remembered") dull immediacy in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts. Information density is high—most sentences advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. However, template cadence appears in the repeated "He narrated" constructions, and some metaphorical density ("gentle grenades of thought," "metronome for questions") occasionally clutters high-pressure beats. The "Ladies and gentlemen" refrains work as taught pattern but risk becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("The iron stacks groaned like ships") but occasional overwriting ("transformative betrayal," "firmly adaptive") and some template structures in the middle section. Information density is high in the decoding sequence. Minor paraphrase loops around the vulnerability theme reduce momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variations and high information density. However, abstract register drift appears in peak moments: "reasons are sensations in costumes," "night wants a different costume," and some elevated diction ("lacunae," "merlons") that slightly strains the mystical-naturalistic register. The figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies ("marbled hush pouring through the merlons").

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful repetition that teaches its pattern ("loops," "sweep," "compose"). Information density high in lines like "Meaning is the way the petals remember they were gears." Minor deductions for occasional abstract passages and some filter constructions ("I realized," "I noticed") that could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with moments of genuine beauty ("crystal whispering forecourt after rain breathes with a resonant hush"). Some metaphoric density approaches overwriting ("blame pulsed like a negative") and occasional abstract phrasing ("the truth, exposed, is gentle enough to sleep in") dulls precision. Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple layers.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("bones quiet as twigs"), though some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("commemorating small victories elaborately keeps the rain respectful"). Information density varies; the strongest passages integrate action and meaning ("I offered a palm of soil, and the vine tasted its own history"). Minor register elevation in places.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Stay, he said, within the hush of beating wings at rest"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph rhythms. Some figurative density in peak moments ("architecture of delayed reflections") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Minor abstract moments but no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines consistently doing double work (e.g., "sandbags puffed like lungs" conveying both flood damage and suffocation theme). Some minor repetition of "between" constructions, but these function as pattern-teaching rather than loops, with strong propulsion through varied sentence openings and purposeful paragraph rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs—"tea the color of rain charts" establishes setting, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("auroral sorrow," "calcifies behind my sternum") but doesn't obscure meaning. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm matching emotional intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves density through lines doing multiple jobs: "I lifted the beaded valve wheel and felt the cold make my palms intelligent." Some repetitive structures appear ("I had come," "I swore," "I mapped") but serve accumulative design. Information flows cleanly despite compressed metaphorical language, though occasional abstractions like "weight of a swallowed truth" risk opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose shows high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Stone drips, ink ferments, and a crumbling peace settles like pollen on forgotten names." Rhythm varies naturally between longer meditative passages and shorter declarative moments. Minor repetition of "regenerative silence" serves thematic purpose rather than scaffold, and the figurative language stays coherent within the established organic register.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clean, musical prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Some moments edge toward overwriting ("the moon bit into the sun like a patient moth") but generally maintain restraint. Information density is high - most sentences advance emotion, atmosphere, and story simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "walls began to listen the way abandoned dogs watch doorways." Some repetition of "displaced axis" and "bronze quiet" serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template moments ("He reads," "He writes," "He sits") don't obscure closure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density varies—strong in "Light scattered over the town in thin squares, and on each kitchen wall the same sentence unfurled" but occasionally loops with near-paraphrase ("open secrets keep the weather calm" echoes similar sentiment multiple times). Some metaphor density in peak beats ("neon fizzed out like a tired constellation") without clear payoff. Opening and closing lines effectively bookend the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The loop caught the slow breath of everyone there and magnified its honesty"). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Minor figurative density in places borders on oversaturation but remains purposeful to the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though density occasionally tips toward overwriting: "the exact tempo of a vanished noon" and similar abstractions. Some metaphor mixing ("room is a throat," "speaking in an upturned hush"). Information density high but occasional loops in the memory sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments of compression ("do not outrun what follows you") but several abstract passages dilute momentum ("periodically eternal, a loop that ends on the hour"). Some elevated diction strains against immediacy ("covenant with the ground," "vectors"). Information density is high in places but uneven, with philosophical abstractions occasionally replacing concrete advancement.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some overwriting in figurative language appears too frequently in peak beats ("filament of hush," "spiral," "stylus of bone" in rapid succession). Template cadence appears briefly ("She imagined...She saw...She believed") though it doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density, though some metaphorical density in non-pressure moments ("dusk pooled," "remembering of leaves") without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I lit a small lantern, then darkened it again, because the starlight knew better how to speak here." Prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor weakness in abstract passages ("meaning pooled between us with passionate subtlety") that occasionally thin specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "pear branches swam through panes, roots drinking brackish light" combines setting, atmosphere, and thematic work. Some mild figurative density in places ("ghostly greenhouse moon") but serves the lyric mode. Clean propulsion through varied syntax, no loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with varied rhythm, but figurative density occasionally obscures ("the grotto's static serving as braille between our pulses"). Some metaphor mixing ("heart will not be bullied," "chest wanted to be a pulse"). Information density is high and most lines advance multiple purposes, though phrases like "professionally thorough" feel templated.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.1)
    Prose flows with poetic moments but suffers from density issues—nearly every sentence contains figurative language without pattern-teaching ("tide keeps time," "envelope with mistaken address, its paper fibers snapping open like sails"). Template structures appear ("Mara knows...," "Jun says...," "They decide..."). Some mixed metaphors muddle clarity (harbor both "finds" and "returns" listening).

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose shows strong control with varied sentence lengths and purposeful rhythm, particularly in accumulative passages like "People noticed and joined..." Some figurative density in places ("luminescent ache," "crater held a mouthful of unsung lullabies") but serves the lyrical mode. Information density high—most sentences advance both plot and atmosphere simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The city called it the ear, and others the mouth of memory"). Rhythm varies naturally between longer descriptive passages and short, tense moments during the echo birth. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("patience was the only coin accepted") and slight repetition in the canal description.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty—"fruit glistening like cooled tears," "moon has lowered a rope of light." However, abstract philosophical passages create momentum drag ("he wonders if emotion can be graphed in the orchard, if sorrow approaches a limit"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without clear payoff, though the mathematical conceit provides pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("He crawled to the northeast pipe chase, where heat lines ticked down and whispering gathered"). Some metaphorical density in early passages ("velvet seam threaded by drafts") borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative mode, while the repeated phrase "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" creates intentional pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm shifts between reflection and action. Some mild redundancy appears ("circuitously sincere" used twice identically) and occasional abstract phrasing ("old question uncoil"), but information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in descriptive passages that advance both setting and emotional state.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "That evening the tides returned with a low gleam, like knives newly honest about their work" advances time, characterizes tide, and builds threat. Some filter constructions ("I showed," "He asked") but voice-appropriate. Minor metaphor density in places without becoming purple.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines like "the color of listening" and "dew returns sky to grass" that compress meaning without obscuring it. Some minor repetition of "overlapping shadows" and slight overuse of paradox constructions ("bright darkness") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with memorable lines, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "herald's trumpet valve" appears with slight variations multiple times; "staggered intervals" repeats without evolution. Some filter-verb clustering ("I ask," "I tell") in dialogue sections. The crystalline opening and closing paragraphs demonstrate capability undermined by middle-section redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density varies—strong moments like "Each squeeze clipped circles from darkness, releasing faint clockwork clicks" contrast with abstract loops ("trembling certainty" appears twice identically). Several passages restate concepts without advancement, particularly in the fortress sequence where dialogue becomes expository.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with varied rhythm and purposeful compression. Information density is high—most lines advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional abstract loops ("Discipline is how the unheard symphony becomes music enough to steer by") and some elevated register drift in emotional peaks. The filter-verb clusters in reflection passages ("I thought," "I felt," "I believed") slightly dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong syntactic variety and information density, with most lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density in early sections ("secret folded into light," "echoes and refuses endings") but serves the accumulative design. Minor template echo with repeated "I [verb]" constructions in paragraphs 7-8. Clean propulsion through the corridor sequence to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density is high - most lines do multiple jobs. "The pumps cough, the vents sigh, and every sound is a calendar without numbers" exemplifies the controlled lyricism. Some mild repetition in waiting/washing imagery, but it serves the accumulative pattern rather than creating loops.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The paths bloom with miniatures, roots braided like sentences waiting for their final, patient punctuation." Rhythm varies naturally between longer meditative passages and shorter declarative moments. Minor repetition in "I" constructions occasionally creates template cadence, but overall the prose maintains momentum through purposeful compression.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong metaphorical density occasionally tips toward overwriting ("paperwork moves faster than tides," "ocean coughed me back"), though most figurative language serves the industrial/maritime atmosphere. Some redundancy in the walking/listening pattern, but prose maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and the "bitter" taste detail lands with specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The shell was his ephemeral compass, guiding not by north, but by how the universe winced at falsehood"). Some metaphor clustering in the middle third creates mild opacity ("Time smudges; he is both boy and man"). Minor template cadence in "He remembers...He retells...He asks" sequence, though varied enough to avoid mechanical feel.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose shows strong control with varied syntax and evocative imagery like "gulls argued with kites" and "drums would not learn our secrets." Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though occasional filter constructions ("I knew it bought us") could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I was purposefully curious, the way you become when every answer feels like a door to another losing." Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the countdown sequence. Minor repetition of "hush" is pattern-taught and pays off thematically. Each sentence advances story, character, or atmosphere without scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong rhythm variation and sensory density, but suffers from repetitive phrasing ("examining light refraction through water features" appears verbatim twice, "heartfelt artisan" twice). Some abstract constructions ("intent belongs to the hummingbird") and filter-heavy passages reduce immediacy. Information density generally high with most sentences doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The lake held its breath, and the girders hummed like teeth pressed tight." Some figurative density in places ("small sun trying to herald morning from thin, blue ribs") but always pattern-consistent. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and strategic compression.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of lyric precision like "tail writing cursive in the dust" and "the unglamorous rhythm of return." However, repetitive constructions around "He [verb]" patterns and synonym loops around walking/pacing/stepping reduce momentum. The density of figurative language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies, as in multiple metaphors for the archway's transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The sea around the trench spread in lonesome splendor, a cathedral of pressure and blue that swallowed the lights of my skiff." Some elevated diction occasionally strains ("lonesome splendor," "ephemeral") but mostly serves the lyric mode. Minor redundancy in describing the vial's properties across multiple beats.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains high density with images doing multiple jobs: "copperlight repose" establishes both atmosphere and thematic state. Strong syntactic variety from short declarations ("I kept rowing back") to complex accumulations. Minor template repetition in "I told her" sequence and the "your own story" pronoun inconsistency, but momentum remains strong through musical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, but several instances of abstraction ("mournful elation," "ephemeral cameo appearances" repeated 3x) and occasional register elevation that doesn't fully match the keeper's voice. The opening and closing lines create effective circularity. Some sentences could be tightened for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose demonstrates strong rhythmic variation and information density, with lines like "The harbor has thinned to ribs" doing multiple jobs. Some overwriting appears in peak moments ("orchid solace, quiet and luminous as dusk tide returning") where figurative language accumulates without clear vehicle. Template cadence occasionally emerges ("I tell them... I leave the plate... I am still") but doesn't pervade enough to seriously damage momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is generally strong with lines doing multiple jobs, but figurative density in places like "catacomb orchard answered with a small wind" and "shadow kissed the numeral for home" accumulates without always advancing pressure. Some template phrasing appears ("I told Sami," "He asked," "I said"). The piece maintains momentum through varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The vaults hold a hush like stacked envelopes, a tone of futuristic nostalgia"). Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("heart loud as sorting machinery") works but approaches overwriting. Minor template cadence appears in "I+verb" constructions mid-story. The withholding of the final action creates effective propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose flows with varied sentence structures and strong imagery like "Some stories are patient enough to roost; some peck until they draw their own blood." Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, some abstract passages ("adjacent possibilities, corridors beside corridors") and occasional overwriting ("soft laughter leaked from them") create minor friction.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The moon lifts, and my wound closes by degrees, a small white door learning how to stay open"). However, abstract phrasing occasionally dulls immediacy ("the space where an apology waits unspoken") and some metaphorical vehicles strain coherence ("fierce tenderness cracking my ribs like kindling").

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("monitors speak pelagic syllables"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("lotus-hearted ache," "weather sensed in common") edges toward overwriting without pattern-teaching, and occasional abstraction ("small fidelity") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"light carries rooms of memory, and I haul them like fruit baskets" advances concept while revealing character. Some overwriting appears ("daydream that hummed," "pensive mirth") without damaging clarity. Information flows cleanly despite complex imagery, though phrases like "rehearsed me" and "noon-bright inside the orchard's echo" strain natural expression.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs (the nickel as straightedge/oracle/bell). Some repetitive phrasing around "pause between question and reply" becomes pattern rather than loop.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some abstract declarations ("truth looks better in chitin and pollen") and occasional template phrases ("I stood on a crate and spoke") create minor friction. The inventive language mostly propels rather than ornaments, with strong rhythmic control throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, some figurative density in peak moments ("photosynthesize pain into beauty," "reef-shadow joy") creates opacity without clear pattern-teaching. Template repetition of "via half-sung lullabies" works as intentional refrain but occasional abstract phrasing ("amnesty ports") dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose maintains high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The lamp knows the way better than my feet" advances action while revealing trust in objects. Some figurative density in peak moments ("syllables sanded thin, a surname like beach glass") risks opacity but serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm, though some abstraction ("carefully reckless" appears multiple times) and occasional overwriting ("heart fugueing"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple purposes. Some metaphorical density in places but largely serves the linguistic theme. Deduction for repetitive "carefully reckless" and some elevated register moments.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.0)
    Strong prose control with purposeful repetition of "as the building breathes" creating structural rhythm. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Some minor overwriting in figurative language ("dust glimmering like tiny verdicts") and occasional abstraction ("delicate balance of receiving and refusing gratitude") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The motes reveal roomsized winds, small currents that crumple messages or cradle them"). Clean propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor repetition of "paper trails" and some abstract phrasing around trust prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong rhythmic control with varied sentence lengths that support the meditative pace. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs. Some abstract moments ("necessary distances," "fractured hush") and occasional elevated diction create minor friction but don't obscure meaning. The prose serves the accumulative pattern well.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, with lines like "The place was shadowseam wonder, all half-light edges" doing multiple jobs. Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("silver fish hung like drowsy stars") but pattern-taught through the astrologer's consistent sky-to-sea translations. Minor template cadence in "We... We... I..." progression mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Light moves like patient fish, cheerful yet full of dignified midnight"). Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in "I [verb]" constructions mid-story. The figurative language occasionally strains ("sandglasses held by polite ghosts tapping their shoes") but maintains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density varies - strong in moments like "Sound maps the night; eyes map the sound" but several passages loop concepts without advancement ("I make luck happen, but gently, like turning a tide with a teacup" restates the premise). Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle clarity ("feral in edges, disciplined in aim").

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Their shoulder was bare, pale as low tide sand, trembling like a string before a bow draws breath" combines description, emotion, and anticipation. Some passages risk overwriting ("obsidian grace filled my arms") but the pattern is taught early and sustained. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity ("I polish the harbor windows until they recall the sea that once invented them") but suffers from occasional paraphrase loops and abstract passages that slow momentum. Lines like "debts to wonder are not settled by closing time" and "clarity has a price, but it can also be a wage" restate similar concepts without adding pressure. Information density varies; stronger when grounded in concrete action, weaker in reflective passages.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some figurative language feels forced ("brittle music," "small immaculate coffin"). The piece suffers from occasional register drift into overly literary constructions that don't quite match the firefighter's voice. Some paraphrase loops appear ("he could not bear"/"I could not bear"), but momentum generally sustains through varied syntax.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The gauge listened to pressure within pressure, its face mottled with salt." However, several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("serene upheaval coursing beneath everywhere," "mindscape," "versions of me living a breath away"). The final third contains some repetitive phrasing around patterns and calibration that could be compressed.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("ivy tapped the window with small weather reports"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("shawl woven from echoes") but pattern-taught and pays off. Minor scaffold in "I thought of the mentors again" but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "narrow as a thread of rain and different as heat over a road." However, several abstract phrases lack concrete grounding ("dusky harmony," "perceptively calm" used twice). Some figurative density borders on overwriting but stays pattern-consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of excellence ("lanterns shook like small moons") but suffers from repetitive sentence structures, particularly "I [verb]" and "We [verb]" patterns. Several paraphrase loops appear ("Patience was our armor, and our debt to the fallen" restates prior content). Information density is moderate; some lines do single duty only.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with memorable phrases like "bought sentiment wholesale and resold the packaging." However, density occasionally tips into opacity: "a collage of photographs stitched with fishing line" followed by "Each seam marked a former current" creates momentary confusion. Some filter constructions ("He felt the release") dull immediacy in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information-dense prose with purposeful repetition, but template cadence appears in sequences like "She knelt...She knew...She guided...She had learned." Mixed metaphors occasionally muddle ("snow sifted like slow fire"). Strong opening and closing lines, but middle sections show some paraphrase loops around the thread-untangling.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("strings crisscrossed the dome like constellations"). Deductions for repetitive "half-lit epiphanies" phrase, some abstract passages that could be more concrete, and occasional register drift ("prosthetic conscience"). The "meteor hush" motif works but appears four times, bordering on overuse.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I strewed reeds into triangles, balanced pebbles on bark, and traced circles of pollen" simultaneously advances action, reveals character method, and builds atmospheric texture. Some repetitive constructions appear ("transiently rooted" used twice) but serve pattern-teaching. The final line delivers propulsive closure through image rather than explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity, but several paraphrase loops diminish momentum ("I had promised to return only after forgiving yourself" echoed later; multiple iterations of name preservation concept). Some filter-verb clustering in middle sections. Strong opening and closing lines partially redeem these issues.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, but scattered template constructions ("I see it then," "I set my palm against it") and some paraphrase loops around the directive/invitation concept dilute momentum. The prose achieves memorable compression in "alphabetized by roots" and "a communion of obsolete authority and my own hunger," but abstract phrases like "ethereal grit" appearing multiple times create mild opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I was the frugal astronomer, apprentice to no lord, paying attention instead of rents"). Some mild repetition around "frugal" but serves thematic accumulation. Strong rhythm variation and purposeful paragraph lengths.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("spine learned to quarrel with waking"), but some overwriting in metaphor density ("shifting grace gusts like a wind with hands" followed immediately by more figurative language). Minor paraphrase loop with "shifting grace" explained twice in adjacent passages. Information density high in peak moments, particularly the factory sequence, though some abstract phrasing ("unopened letters" as metaphor) occasionally dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative language mostly serves the accumulative pattern ("frost shimmered up the glass," "stars flickered in its ribs like trapped bees"). Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional abstraction ("cruel torn edges," "geometry where Noor first learned numbers") and some repetitive phrasing around breathing/exhaling that borders on template cadence in the middle section.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative density occasionally tips toward overwriting—"small ache of neglect," "dropped marble rolling"—but serves the accumulative mode. Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some template cadence in middle sections ("We needed...So I set...Out came...") disrupts flow. Final paragraph's rhythm accelerates effectively toward closure.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("the sum of harvests resembled nonlinear inheritance") but suffers from density overload and occasional opacity. Some metaphors strain comprehension ("braided a hazard"), and passages like "brightened disquiet guiding him through the pages that keep writing us" risk abstraction. Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwrought territory. The piece would benefit from selective pruning of its more baroque flourishes.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I carry a botanical diary scavenged from the traveler's satchel, its pressed leaves captioned in a script that breathes when warmed" establishes object, origin, and magical properties efficiently. Some metaphorical density in early paragraphs ("unread melodies," "sleeping organ") could be pruned. Sentence variety and rhythm support the lyric mode, though occasional abstraction ("recognized as recognition") needs grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("ferris wheel leaned like a compass needle resting on the lip of the world"). Some repetitive phrasing around "narrative threads" and occasional abstract constructions ("trapped freedom," "unkindled solace") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The brass warmed, and within its hush he heard catalog numbers rearranging themselves"), but repetitive "He [verb]" constructions appear in 8+ consecutive lines mid-story. Some abstract philosophizing ("Absence is not emptiness but a measurement of relation yet to form") slows momentum without immediate scenic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but some instances of abstract phrasing ("gently luminous folds of charge") and occasional redundancy in describing the energy beings' effects. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "I [verb]" constructions reduces momentum slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("stories snipped by winds that sounded like scissors being cleaned"). Information density high—most sentences advance multiple purposes. Minor repetitive structures appear ("By night...by day," "We taught them...we stitched") and occasional elevated diction ("choreography," "semaphore") creates slight register drift, but momentum and clarity remain intact through closure.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of compression like "We took conjecture like bread, breaking it to share hypotheses" demonstrate control. However, abstract runs weaken momentum: "preemptively nostalgic for losses not yet tallied" and similar elevated passages create opacity without clear payoff. The prose achieves density but sacrifices clarity in places, particularly in the opening third where conceptual language dominates concrete action.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing weaken immediacy ("gravity of hopelessness," "patient shape"). Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor template cadence in the preparation sequence ("At the western tower...At the cistern...") though it creates intentional ritual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty but suffers from density issues with figurative language appearing in most sentences without clear payoff. Template cadence emerges in "I will..." repetitions, and some abstract passages ("texture of time") lack concrete grounding, though the writing remains competent overall.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.8)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of overwrought figurative language ("gilded hush blown through its beams like pollen") and abstract constructions ("something intangibly tangible") create opacity. The prose maintains momentum despite these friction points, with strong rhythm variation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density is high—most sentences advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously, as in "the numbers, she says, are compassionate about everything except the hand on the door." Some repetition of "quiet/hush" variants slightly dulls momentum mid-story. The recursive structure with the train whistle creates purposeful rhythm, and technical terms like "storm glass vial" and "soundfall" feel earned within the world's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"trees wired to the broken dome, pears glowing with unsent messages" establishes setting, worldbuilding, and atmosphere simultaneously. Some minor repetitive structures in the middle section ("We crossed," "We stepped," "We widened") but these create purposeful accumulative rhythm. The "peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals" phrase appears twice verbatim, creating intentional echo rather than loop.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally strong prose with memorable phrases ("I am the one who burns bridges carefully, collecting the ash"). Information density high throughout. Some abstract constructions ("loaded emptiness which weighed enough to ground us") and occasional opacity in the middle section ("which was weather") create minor friction. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I am a pyramid scheme survivor, stitched with IOU scars"). However, figurative density occasionally overwhelms clarity ("shadowseam wonder," "ghost alphabets"). Template cadence appears in the parallel-texts section ("The texts start...They arrive...Each sender"). Information density is strong but momentum occasionally stalls in abstract passages.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=6.8)
    "Eloquently silent" repeats four times, creating a loop that dulls impact. Some metaphors strain—"questions wearing boots of grief" lacks clarity. However, strong moments like "golden shadows pooled like tea" and the ash forming letters through resonance show imaginative precision. Prose serves the accumulative structure but contains enough repetition and abstract passages to limit score.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong imagery and rhythm in passages like "He unsnapped the buckle of his visor, letting the cold night lay a palm on his face." However, abstract phrases like "the shape of possibility" and "statistics of miracles" create opacity, and some sentences loop concepts without advancing ("reality shifts" appears twice without clear differentiation). The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity but inconsistently.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The dust around it was stippled, not smooth, as if a careful bird had pecked out a breadcrumb map"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("I am broken-hearted"/"My heart still hurt") and filter verbs accumulate in places ("I recognized," "I knew," "I imagined") but don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong figurative density serves the accumulative design—"auric lagoon," "tiny hearts restarting after winter," moths as "storm of soft bodies." Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("tyranny of indifference" appears twice) and some filter constructions ("she imagined," "she thought of") that slightly dull immediacy in the middle third.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I am the morning fog saxophonist, a title earned by playing what cannot be played without the fog to hold the notes"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful compression. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("things with more hunger than patience") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with high information density and varied rhythm. Some figurative density in places ("raftered branches," "filigreed stacks") but it serves the accumulative mode. Clean grammar and purposeful paragraph structure. Deduction for occasional ornamental phrases and slight overwriting in descriptive passages that don't always advance pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with good information density and varied rhythm. Some overwriting appears ("kindness brutal enough to teach," "uncertainly certain of moving honestly") that borders on paradox-stacking. Occasional template structures ("I [verb], [verb], and [verb]") appear but don't dominate. The water-clock assembly sequence shows excellent concrete detail.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm, but figurative density occasionally obscures ("ore turned to whisper," "ghost tonguing my every step"). Some paraphrase loops appear ("Names attract their histories, and histories drag like nets"). Information density is high but sometimes tips into overwriting that slows momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "trembling like light on oil" and effective rhythm variation. Deductions for occasional abstract phrases ("modestly fearless" appears twice), some elevated diction that borders on purple ("luminous ache of memory"), and minor redundancy in describing the harp's function across multiple sentences.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("trees answer with a chorus of faint equations"), but some abstract phrases weaken momentum ("mathematics of mercy," "algorithm demands honesty"). Occasional redundancy in conceptual territory. The lyric mode mostly succeeds but occasionally drifts toward opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("unsellable, which is to say, most true"). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, though some abstract phrasing ("anchors of intuition," "eternal instant") creates minor opacity. The prose accelerates appropriately during the lens revelation sequence. No significant loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong information density, though some repetitive stems appear ("I + verb" patterns in middle section). Lines often do multiple jobs, as in "The ghosts had waited for someone to balance the clock," which advances plot while maintaining voice.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The wind of the cloud sea hummed, and the branches answered with rustling awakenings"). Some abstract phrasing ("negotiation had not ended; it had deepened") and occasional synonym proximity ("rustling awakenings"/"rustling awakenings rose") prevent higher scoring, but no loops or scaffolding mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but some abstract phrasing dulls immediacy ("futility minted in my bones," "contamination by ideology"). Information density high in descriptive passages. Minor register elevation in places doesn't match the embodied discovery scenes, though no loops or scaffolding present.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The city has been dim for three rotations, all our mornings bruised"). Some figurative language borders on over-density ("ribs of brass catching lunar flecks") but serves the accumulative texture. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("I told them... They listened...") slightly dulls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm and information density. Some overwriting in figurative language ("Something inside me opens on corroded pins, a hinged awakening of grief") and occasional template constructions ("I take off," "I take the scarf"). The "hinged" repetition works thematically but becomes slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in craft sequences where action reveals character and theme simultaneously. Some figurative density in peak moments ("scaffold complexity with simplicity" appears three times) creates mild redundancy. The phrase "layered meanings" recurs without sufficient variation, though it doesn't obscure the closure's clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with high information density and varied syntax, but some figurative density in peak moments: "I felt a hinge turn, and a new mural unfolded inside me" mixes metaphors. Several passages achieve exceptional clarity: "Night, I thought, is not the opposite of day but a careful engraving that lets certain truths appear."

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline imagery ("obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes waits like an eye sunk in cooled lava") but suffers from abstract constructions that obscure concrete action. Phrases like "the pattern ripens" and "a topography of defiance spelled in refuse" prioritize lyricism over clarity. Some template cadence appears in the repetitive "I + verb" constructions mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.0)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear ("revival...revival," "large things...large"), some template phrasing ("She [verb], then [verb]"), and abstract register drift in peak moments. The "faint ticking" closure image lands cleanly despite earlier density issues.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density varies—strong passages like "I record with my stylus on the parchment, mapping stains, the pauses between words" do multiple jobs, but repetitive stems appear ("I have come," "I spread," "I speak," "I became"). Some metaphors strain clarity ("wave shouldering a swimmer") without enhancing meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prose density is exceptional with lines doing multiple jobs ("The cap becomes a wheel hub, and the seeds align"). Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("the texture of borrowed time" appears twice without full embodiment) and slight repetition in the seasonal litany, though both serve the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid phrases like "the sanctuary hummed like an empty lung." Some density issues with extended metaphors ("river that sometimes speaks through the ductwork") and occasional abstract moments ("switching our posture"). The paraphrase of listening appearing multiple times creates minor redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I swept stardust from the floor" establishes role, setting, and cosmic scale simultaneously. Syntactic variety supports the accumulative structure without loops or scaffolding. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("primal elegance of maintenance") but figurative language generally serves pressure, especially "honeyed light draped the gauges like shawls."

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The world burned, the bees fled, and his last negotiation became a tangled covenant with loss." Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the queen's visit. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("Being astonished had become his only arrogance") that could be more embodied, though the line's follow-up "tender and deliberate as candlelight" partially recovers.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs—"I pocketed it because it sounded like tomorrow when tomorrow was still a place you could walk to" compresses nostalgia, loss, and hope. Minor repetition of "damaged time capsule" and some filter constructions ("I told them," "I wanted") slightly reduce momentum but don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.9)
    Generally strong prose with high information density and varied syntax. Some figurative excess in places ("loosened threads of light," "wicker lid from a sleeping basket of song") creates slight opacity. The line "We can only tend what sings to us" achieves memorable compression. Deduction for occasional template phrasing ("He has come to...He uses it to...").

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The copper sang faintly, an insect choir corrected by the living stone until pitch met pulse"). Some figurative density in places ("sentences of labor," "white alphabet") but serves the lyric mode. Minor template cadence in middle sections ("I learned...I told them...I showed them") reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstraction dulls momentum ("chemistry of homecoming," "designed return route"). Some elevated diction in peak moments ("makeshift reaction yielded") creates mild register drift, and the phrase "strangers...began to converge" uses "converge" redundantly within the same sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "He brews them from kelp ash, bone dust, and pulverized shells that once housed the music of coral streets" layers process, materials, and loss. Some elevated diction ("submerged concord," "unseam the wind") fits the mythic register. Minor repetition of "narrow vastness" serves as purposeful bookend.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.0)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs (Harbor's description establishes both setting and emotional tenor). Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the relay activation sequence. Some figurative density in places ("shadows turned amber and violet") but it serves the accumulative pattern. Occasional near-synonyms ("cracked wasteland" appears twice) prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "cathedral abandoned mid hymn" and effective rhythm variation, but some paraphrase loops appear ("echoed silence nested"/"echoed silence naming") and abstract phrases like "vein of intention" and "measured mercy" edge toward purple prose. Information density is high in stronger passages but occasionally dilutes with conceptual abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose shows strong moments ("ships sailed the stratosphere like patient sharks") but suffers from ornamental density in places ("corridor unwound in slow spirals, exhaling cold"). Some metaphor mixing ("weather knotted to memory") and elevated diction clusters reduce clarity. Information density is high but occasionally tips into overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in gesture descriptions that advance both action and theme. Some paraphrase loops appear ("unbind the record from spectacle...bind it to your smallest rescue"). Template cadence emerges in the spelling sequence but serves the pattern. Mixed metaphor tension between "nomadic penumbra" as shadow and as traveling companion.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The mountain shelved storms behind its quiet" sets atmosphere while foreshadowing change. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("remembering becomes painful") and one instance of elevated diction that slightly exceeds the POV's established register.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines consistently doing multiple jobs, as in "I, who fidgets productively, moving tokens and aligning edges, turned misfortune into a map between my fingers." Some elevated diction ("fierce repose," "winnowed from silence") occasionally strains but doesn't obscure clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong figurative control with "forged hush," "pockets of silence stitched into their cheeks," and the canyon learning "manners." Information density high throughout, though some paraphrase loops appear ("The defiant artist had questioned, then, and the question had never stopped ringing"). Line-level craft supports the lyric mode but occasional abstraction dulls immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density varies: strong passages like "Each plunge steals a little fear and returns a little clarity" contrast with overwritten sections ("The sea gnaws the pontoons, each kiss a hiss"). Some metaphor strain appears ("the engine yawns unless I narrate the logic it will inherit"), and occasional template constructions emerge, though the closing sequence maintains cleaner propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose is dense and purposeful with lines doing multiple jobs: "The ceiling breathes in mineral syllables, and my footfalls thrum with other painters, other tides." Some figurative density in peak beats ("temporary eternity" appears multiple times) but it's pattern-taught and pays off. Strong propulsion through varied syntax and careful rhythm control.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but occasional abstraction dulls immediacy ("gratitude needs a crossing guard"). Some metaphorical density in peak moments risks opacity ("two notes on a staff, and the shore begins to score itself"). Template cadence appears briefly in mid-section ("I light... I keep... I learned...").

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "rasps through salt and static like a match lit underwater" show excellent compression. However, abstract phrases like "geography of loss" and "necessary mercy" appear without earning their weight through concrete grounding. Some filter constructions ("I feel her voice rise") could be more immediate. Information density is generally high with good propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythmic variation and purposeful compression. Information density is high—most sentences do multiple jobs. Some abstract phrasing ("psychological safety," "fractured grace") and occasional overwriting ("creaked like a chandelier strung between cliffs") but no loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstract phrasing like "witnessed isolation has a weight to it" could be more concrete. Prose rhythm varies naturally with effective paragraph breaks. Some elevated diction ("nautical twilight," "stubborn dead") fits the keeper's contemplative voice but occasionally borders on overwriting in phrases like "the particular gap where a final breath wants to be a letter."

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.7)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("shining black commas on pale stones"), but some redundancy exists ("I felt the promise pull tight"/"Ruth used to say promises linger"). Information density is high in most beats, though a few passages could tighten further.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of ornamental density ("lacy menace of power and mercy knotted together") and some filter-verb clustering ("she felt," "she saw," "she wondered") in middle sections. The paraphrase loop about dreams returning appears twice. Final paragraph achieves clean propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.2)
    While individual sentences show strong craft ("the curl releases a proof, a thimble of light that does not blind"), the piece suffers from density overload with figurative language in nearly every line. Some passages loop conceptually ("presence is a metal that refuses to alloy with hurry" followed by similar abstractions). The prose would benefit from strategic breathing room.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density and varied rhythm, though some metaphorical density in places ("Feral nostalgia paced the room, baring its teeth"). Prose propels through concrete images and avoids loops, with effective sentence variety and purposeful compression that serves the accumulative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The bell does not ring because fog swallows sound" establishes atmosphere while explaining the narrator's first speech. Prose rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during repair sequences. Some figurative density in opening third but serves the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("ink that crystallizes when stressed" both worldbuilds and mirrors emotional state). Some minor repetition in scar descriptions, but the prose maintains strong momentum through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph lengths that mirror breathing constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose shows strong moments ("dust sang under my shoes") alongside occasional overwriting. Information density is generally high with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphors strain ("memory chooses a door"), and there's mild template cadence in the "I had" constructions. The final line lands effectively with "though it was an imperfect miracle, it was ours."

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves density through lines doing multiple jobs ("The library accepted my breath and returned none of its own"). Some abstract passages slow momentum ("By training and by accident, I was both judge and record"). Strong opening and closing lines, but middle sections occasionally loop conceptual territory.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"the echoes stitched themselves thin as frost along the railings" combines sound, texture, and dissolution. Some mild repetition in measurement language serves the accumulative pattern. The "razor edges" motif effectively recurs without becoming mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Security could work through permeable barriers, like water finding shape without losing itself"). Some abstract phrasing ("familiar strangers," "hosted them long enough") creates minor opacity, and the "quiet wildfire" metaphor in the final line, while resonant, slightly strains coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation, but several instances of elevated diction strain credibility ("rainwashed," "clover melancholy," "queerly serifed"). Information density is high and most sentences advance multiple purposes, though phrases like "lucid contradictions" appear too frequently without sufficient variation.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"She spun it with a damp finger to tune her breath to the wires" combines action, method, and metaphor. Some abstract passages ("melodically haunted," "cultivating estrangement") slightly reduce clarity but serve the accumulative mode. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the tide hummed like a low string and swallows stitched dusk to the sea"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("gull let the wind hold it in a white parenthesis") borders on overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern. Prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful repetition of "proximate causes."

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("They redirected leftovers from a shuttered hotel to the station, and laughter from the station to the street"). No loops or scaffolding, strong verb choices throughout. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("particular pressure and fizz") but propulsion remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.1)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstract phrasing ("uncharted emotional depths") could be more concrete. The rhythm varies naturally, accelerating through discovery and slowing for reflection, with strong control in peak moments.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Del tapped the pen against his lip and said, We do not receive; we edit." Some metaphor density in early sections ("stations turned slowly inside the Quiet, precessing like a thought avoiding itself") risks opacity but serves the accumulative pattern. Information flow maintains momentum through concrete actions (uncapping pen, pressing nib to wrist, drawing terraces).

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Click, a ledger entry of nothing, the most faithful record possible tonight." Some minor repetition around "mapping silence" but it serves the accumulative pattern. Excellent syntactic variety and rhythmic control throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves density through compound images like "seeds that looked like punctuation" and "feathers from burned atlases." Information layers effectively in most sentences. However, some ornamental phrases ("heart steaming with volcanic tenderness") and occasional register elevation ("analytically intuitive" appears three times) create mild friction without clear pattern-teaching.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The garden heard intentions the way a seashell hears the ocean"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("auroral sorrow, that color of becoming that hurts because it is true") borders on overwriting but maintains coherence. Minor template cadence in "I + verb" constructions mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The maps were origami logic, capable of being refolded into new corridors whenever a crane operator sneezed differently." Some figurative language edges toward density in places ("grin like a scar"), but rhythm varies purposefully and no loops or scaffolding appear.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong prose rhythm with varied sentence lengths creating breathing space ("We waited. He walked. I watched."). Information density is high, with lines like "spiralingly calm" doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional abstract constructions ("shame tried retreating") and slight overuse of figurative language in places.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density varies, with strong moments like "small kings felt warm as teacups in young hands" doing multiple jobs, but some passages lean abstract ("the hush where past meets prophecy"). Mild repetition in phrasing ("unspoken words" appears three times) and occasional overwrought metaphors ("library walls drank our breath like paper drinks light") create texture drag. Prose remains clear enough to follow the accumulative structure despite lyric density.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and good momentum, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("combative tenderness," "patient violence") that could be more concrete. Some metaphor density in high-pressure beats without full payoff. The "violence becomes impossible" worldbuilding could use clearer grounding. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("turbines cast slow shadows...like clock hands that forgot their point"). Rhythm varies naturally between performance segments and quiet observations. Deduction for occasional abstract drift ("remade hush, one that earns its floorboards") and slight repetition of "Behold" structure without sufficient variation.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong momentum with purposeful compression, though occasional redundancy appears ("tremor of certainty" used twice, some paraphrase loops around fear/courage). Lines often do multiple jobs effectively, as in "glass fogs and clears, a diaphragm breathing the boundary porous and kind."

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in the plant-language passages. However, several abstract formulations weaken precision: "beauty in imperfection is a rhythm," "listen open," "the world chooses its own edges." Some repetitive sentence openings ("He + verb" pattern) in middle sections. The prose achieves lyric coherence but occasionally sacrifices concrete clarity for elevated register.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. However, some paraphrase loops appear: "Connection there had texture: the rough of steel spoons, the moist crumb of confession" restates rather than advances. Template cadence in "I ring... I hear... I remember" sequence. These artifacts don't touch closure but prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The dome looked newly cut from night" combines setting, time, and emotional state. Some figurative density in emotional beats risks overwriting ("ardor subdued as a red star") but generally serves accumulative texture. Minor redundancy in explaining the intention/action metaphor weakens momentum mid-piece.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.0)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("coins washing in a sink" evokes both sound and economic metaphor). Some mild repetition of "multiplying paths" phrase, but generally strong momentum with varied sentence structures and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly "I blinked without rhythm, stepped irregularly, and hummed no melody." Some elevated diction in peak beats ("calibrated to steadily unpredictable truths") creates minor register drift. No loops or scaffolding, but occasional abstract passages reduce immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments ("vines of letters climbed the rafters"). Some overwriting in figurative density - nearly every sentence contains metaphor or elevated diction. Template cadence appears in "She walked... She carried... She poured..." sequence. Information density high but occasionally opaque ("the shadow wrote looping questions on the floor").

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("no bigger than a torn leaf vein") and purposeful repetition ("misty workshop under stars"). Some template cadence appears mid-story ("I counted tinctures, counted sutures, counted the apologies") and occasional abstraction ("fragile convictions," "honest shape") slightly dulls immediacy, though the closing image lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("each pin is a star in an impossible sky") but suffers from occasional overwriting and abstract constructions ("closure is not a gate but a garden"). Some sentences strain under figurative weight, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy ("I can read," "I know").

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful rhythm variations and high information density, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("tender heat," "modest growl") and occasional synonym loops around love/unused/stored concepts. The extended warehouse metaphor sometimes produces scaffold sentences. Strong opening and closing lines, with the final image of "hands learning to hold" effectively charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the night repeats it in color") with strong syntactic variety and rhythm. However, abstract phrases like "unwritten calendar" appear four times without gaining precision, creating mild loops. Some sentences strain under metaphorical weight ("the instrument hums in my hands like a hive discovering spring"). Information density is generally high, though the middle section about studying sky-charts could compress further.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.1)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("I am the dreamless freight guard" establishes character, condition, role). Some metaphor density in middle sections borders on overwriting ("seeds learning to be embers, embers rehearsing to be rivers"). Minor scaffold in repetitive "I [verb]" constructions but momentum maintains.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some philosophical passages border on abstract ("the wild frontier did not mean escape, but a promise of interior distance"). Sentence variety creates natural rhythm, particularly in discovery sequences. Minor scaffold appears in repeated "I [verb]" constructions mid-story, and some metaphors strain ("lung" for ravine) without breaking clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong rhythmic control and information density, particularly in "We shall traverse the ridge when it appears, the second guide says, through indirect routes that your own feet will decide." Some repetitive phrasing around "vigil in twilight" (appears twice). No loops or scaffolding in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong prose with high information density and varied syntax. Some moments of elevated diction ("seraphically mundane," "unpardonable silence") work within the established register. Minor deduction for occasional abstract formulations that could be more concrete ("the injury was not just electrical but choral").

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Lyr, still diminutive and vast"). Sentence variety and rhythm support the mythic tone without becoming monotonous. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("truth here arrived like tides") that could be more concrete, though the figurative language generally enhances rather than obscures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The ribbon pulsed with a rhythm that felt periodically eternal, a beating archive older than my breath"). Some figurative density in places ("kelp," "vertebrae," "gatehinged") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor repetition of "assembled/assemble" but it's pattern-taught and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm, especially in the stone circle sequence. Information density generally high. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("mineral and memory," "braided with the hum") and the abstract final line. The "margin of daylight" metaphor works but appears three times without evolution.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with moments of beauty: "the warm stone sang in a pitch that turned her knees to memory." Some paraphrase loops exist ("She spoke of... She let the reed chorus translate her promise"). Minor template cadence in the listing sequences reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("a pearl of stillness, weightless and strong") but suffers from occasional template cadence and filter-verb clusters in emotional beats. Information density varies, with some paragraphs doing multiple jobs while others loop through similar emotional territory without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong moments of compressed imagery but some overwriting in metaphor density ("lighthouse clicked its cracked lens like a tongue trying to remember a prayer"). Several abstract constructions ("necessary darkness," "luminescent ache") and occasional register elevation. Information density is high but some figurative excess in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("I am an albino tracker, a silhouette that refuses to darken") but occasionally strains with abstract constructions ("an algorithm in the metronome that wants every heart to lag"). Some passages risk opacity without quite breaking clarity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"pipes hissed beneath the aisles where frost furred the brass like patient moss" combines setting, atmosphere, and the preservation theme. Some abstract phrasing ("bravely conflicted," "starving for escape") and occasional register elevation in peak moments reduce clarity. No significant loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "They leave footprints in the vestibule sand, then stall at the thresholds of roses" tracks physical movement while suggesting spiritual hesitation. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("engraved quiet") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs: "The sea there was not water but braided music, ripples of bass and hush." Some figurative density in peak beats ("waves rose into antlers and broke into petals") approaches overwriting but serves the lyric mode. Minor template cadence in "She asked... I said... I told her" sequence deducts slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong metaphorical density serves the accumulative mode ("dome answers with a hollow hush that feels like testimony"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("devotedly observant," "gently astonished") without full POV grounding. Information density high throughout with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The floor listens back through boards salvaged from antique furniture, each plank ringing with narratives we brushed aside." Some metaphoric density in peak beats ("guilt lives in waveforms") but generally controlled. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("chalk is a listening stone" works literally and metaphorically). Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("lilac unease, delicate but sure") risks overwriting but serves the accumulative pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "The caves accept agreements better than commands" and effective rhythm variation during the storm sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "I am tasked to shape one without lies" followed closely by "speak carefully for what cannot speak" restates similar content. Template cadence emerges in middle sections with repeated "I [verb]" constructions. The abstract register around "factually mystical work" and "transitional objects" creates occasional opacity.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("the truth unravels in the faintest tremor of the shelves"). Rhythm varies naturally between longer meditative passages and shorter declarative moments. Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("braided memory of many throats") risks opacity but maintains overall momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. However, some phrases border on overwriting ("a whiteness recording pressure like paper without any ink trace") and there's occasional redundancy ("careful, like brushstrokes made without needing witnesses nearby"). Information density is good but not exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery but suffers from occasional opacity ("spindrift serenity") and some metaphorical density that obscures rather than clarifies. Lines like "Every pierce of the cloth sounded small and true, a heartbeat found again" demonstrate strong rhythmic control. Some passages require multiple readings for basic comprehension, creating momentum drag in places.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs, and the prose maintains momentum through varied rhythm and syntax. Some abstract passages about phototropic qualities and fractured timelines occasionally slow propulsion. Minor template cadence in "She [verb]" constructions appears 4-5 times but doesn't cluster enough to trigger major penalty. Strong opening and closing lines that anchor voice and recharge motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"I row toward the point with the rhythm of oars in water, steady, counting breaths, matching my pulse to the quiet thunder in the pilings" layers action, emotion, and atmosphere. Minor register drift in "frank relief that feels like forgiveness" and slight redundancy in the lock-picking sequence prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The voices are brittle awakenings themselves, cracking into syllables when wind kisses the wicker." Some figurative density in peak moments ("damp constellations drip across my wrists") serves the accumulative mode. Minor repetition of "hum" and "resonance" reads as pattern-teaching rather than loop.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.5)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though "prismatic quiet" appears three times without variation and some phrases lean purple ("stormlight as if it were a shy animal"). The piece maintains good momentum despite occasional abstract flights, and the final sentence lands with appropriate weight.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I watched the mixer lights like stars, blinking out constellations of disagreement"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("It showed me neighborhoods from above, gossiping like galaxies, empires traced in traffic") occasionally approaches overwriting but remains purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I am prudently adventurous, which means I bring chalk, patience, and an exit strategy"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks. Deduction for occasional elevated diction that slightly strains POV credibility ("shadowed nexus," "spatial mutiny") and one instance of slight overwriting in the opening, though these don't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Lance the silt, the deputy had said, and see what bubbles"). Some mild repetition around the "unifying opposites" concept and occasional register elevation ("a bowl of breath held by stone") that doesn't quite match the investigative frame, but overall momentum remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery ("squalls staggered like wounded cattle"). However, several instances of overwriting appear: "spongey dread clinging to every map," mixed metaphors ("carrot shaped like a shuttered door"), and some redundancy in description. The inventive language occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("Wind frays the tourist maps, traffic shushes below"). Some metaphorical density in peak beats ("pixelated amnesty," "luminous disbelief") fits the lyrical mode but occasionally obscures clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong imagistic density with phrases like "paper money crackled like unclaimed thunderheads" and varied sentence structures. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Minor deductions for occasional abstract constructions ("territorial markers" used somewhat repetitively) and rare opacity ("patience of fences and totals"), but overall momentum and clarity remain strong.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, especially in passages like "Stars brightened and faded, and we took down their music as carefully as surgeons." Some abstract phrasing ("midnight solace," "tender quiet") and occasional template structures ("She said... I said...") prevent higher scoring, but no loops or scaffolding mar the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dense, purposeful prose with strong information density—most sentences advance multiple layers. Some elevated diction ("unmilitant notch") occasionally strains, but rhythm control during key beats ("I drop the flesh-eating plant seed into the current and whisper a treaty") maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "a maze topiary clipping wrapped in wax paper and rumor" layers object, texture, and uncertainty. Some abstract phrasing ("purposefully curious about the shape of the breach") and occasional register elevation reduce immediacy. Syntax varies purposefully, supporting the accumulative build. The "grammar" transformation crystallizes without overexplanation.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.9)
    Prose demonstrates high information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The pit held a boy with cindery eyes, humming to the bone-hand as if it were a trapped bird" establishes location, character, and emotional state simultaneously.

Clean grammar and varied syntax throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variation, though several abstract metaphors reduce clarity ("grief kept finding the gap between stories and sleep").

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The tablets list rituals for maintaining the orchard of suspended trunks and the breathing rails" establishes world, task, and stakes). However, some abstract phrasing ("haunted ambitions that never settled," "touching distance to storms") and occasional paraphrase loops ("Not to call her back, but to meet the edge where bonds loosen") reduce momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery, though occasional abstraction dulls momentum ("accepting contradictions" appears four times). Some lines achieve excellent density ("kelp coat dries into paper, then leaves its chlorophyll on the floor like a signature") while others lean toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with high information density and purposeful rhythm, but some overwriting appears in figurative language ("ghost rivers," "scalloped like a throat"). Minor template cadence in the confession sequence ("A woman confessed... A boy admitted... A scientist whispered") and occasional register elevation detract from otherwise clean execution.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density high throughout—"storm drunk with certainty" compresses professional hubris and emotional blindness. Syntactic variety supports rhythm: short declarations ("My method is daringly methodical") alternate with complex accumulations. Some minor repetition of "daringly methodical" and occasional filter constructions ("I had read, once") prevent higher scoring, though prose remains propulsive and clear at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs—the watch description simultaneously builds atmosphere, advances plot, and develops theme. Some paraphrase loops appear ("to write without marks and speak without sound" closely echoes earlier promises).

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm, but several instances of abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("perforated destiny," "vacuum the dust of its story"). Some figurative density in high-pressure moments ("mulberry ache of decision bruise his ribs") that slightly slows momentum. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I cleaned the cold from her skin" simultaneously advances action, reveals temperature, and suggests care. Some figurative density in peak beats ("lattices that do not break all at once") occasionally approaches overwriting but remains pattern-coherent. Minor template cadence in "I [verb]" constructions mid-story prevents higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose shows strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, though some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("umbral grotto greeted me with vineyard hush").

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I strapped my tinderbox shut, tucked my gloves, and slipped into the water with the ease of someone who has practiced leaving"). Some figurative density in peak moments ("nacre, the sort of light a shell keeps after listening to tides") and occasional abstract philosophizing dilute momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language mostly lands ("coins rang like compact planets"), but density occasionally overwhelms ("a shoreless feeling, that we were already on the far side of our choice"). Some conceptual abstraction dulls momentum ("understanding static bursts, and letting the snow speak syllables of rearranged time").

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.2)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "brine kept time in unseen aquifers, ticking a patient metronome of absence."

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong syntactic variety and information density, though occasional ornamental phrases like "unhurried lantern lit from within" edge toward overwriting without disrupting clarity. Excellent propulsion through varied paragraph lengths and sentence structures that mirror the dripping rhythm being observed.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with purposeful rhythm variations, particularly in the accumulative middle section. However, abstract phrases like "spin stories into shared meaning" and "memory there behaves like undertow" create mild opacity. Some repetitive constructions ("He remembers," "He had said") in the backstory section, though the accumulative design partially justifies the pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The frozen dew crystal chimed faintly, a bell of winter inside summer"). Some repetitive phrasing around "secretly sentimental" and occasional abstract constructions ("the touch of wonder") that could be more concrete. Rhythm varies appropriately with scene needs, accelerating during the starlings' movements and slowing for contemplation.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The wing slides sideways, catching the blue-green clue"). Some metaphorical density in early passages ("cathedral," "rope veins") without full payoff. Minor template cadence in middle section ("I tell him," "I do not add") briefly disrupts flow.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments like "Light pools like breath on glass" and "Memory smokes like ice under pressure" show figurative precision. However, abstract passages like "friendship with uncertainty requires reciprocity" and some template constructions ("She tells me...She asks...I tell her...I say") create momentum drag. The density is high but occasional abstraction ("practice foggy lucidity") lacks the concrete specificity of the best lines.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong prose rhythm with varied sentence lengths creating natural breathing. Information density high - most lines advance both literal action and symbolic meaning. Minor repetition of "successive approximation" and slight abstraction in places ("principle made visible"), but overall momentum remains strong through precise, active verbs and concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The mast became a stylus, and the gorge became a record, and the moon lowered the needle of gravity"), though some figurative density in peak beats approaches overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "The city beyond the span gnashes in perfect meter, a mechanical world that has forgotten its own melody." Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("a map of wounds that become windows") but serves the lyrical mode. Minor issues include occasional abstract phrasing like "fuller attention" and some synonym accumulation around music/sound, though momentum remains strong through the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied rhythm. Information density is high—most lines advance multiple layers. Deductions for occasional overwrought moments ("promises whisper loudest, as if they were coins rolling after closing") and some template repetition in structure ("I walk," "I find," "I stay"). The "respectfully rebellious" phrase appears twice identically.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Wind coiled through broken windows, ringing the bells he had hung between couplers, and the air answered with a whispering gleam." Some figurative density in peak beats ("lattice of time," "lantern made entirely of listening") but pattern-taught and purposeful. Minor repetition of "quietly persistent" and occasional abstract phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments like "chairs sit like commas in a sentence still deciding what to mean" show excellent craft. However, abstract passages ("distribution of endings, the shorelines where closures erode") and some repetitive constructions ("I [verb]" patterns) create momentum drag. The ending sequence regains propulsion with concrete images.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "margins filled with salt" and "unfurled like a letter from childhood." Deductions for occasional abstract loops ("cipher of longing that resisted any simple key" followed by similar abstraction) and some filter-heavy passages in the middle third that reduce immediacy. Line-level craft supports but doesn't elevate the accumulative structure.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean, propulsive prose with high information density—most sentences advance both literal and metaphorical tracks simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in sequences like "He smiled and told me to sing anyway, because doors learn from daring." Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("cosmic possibility").

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Decades later still felt like yesterday here, because the light remembered how to touch the glass").

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "the swing outside tapping air like a metronome for missing parents" combines setting, atmosphere, and backstory. Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("bruise remembering light") but serves the accumulative pattern. Minor template cadence in repeated "I [verb]" constructions early on.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("the cut released a scent like bread learning to rise") but suffers from occasional abstract scaffolding ("radiant hush" appears three times, "capturing essence" twice). Some metaphors strain ("afterglow pooled between the lines"). Information density generally high with most sentences doing multiple jobs, though a few loop near-synonyms ("wise orchard pruner the valley trusted").

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong imagistic density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Tools like this teach you that silence can be a thing that accumulates." Some repetitive constructions around "we [verb]" in the middle section and occasional abstract phrasing ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush") that could be more concrete. No loops or scaffolding, but figurative density occasionally obscures rather than clarifies.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.7)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The church crouched beyond, small and stubborn as a knuckle." Some metaphor density in places ("rain moving across its slate like slow prayer") and occasional abstraction ("methodically curious" appears twice). The prose maintains good momentum despite contemplative pace.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs, as in "I copied them onto my slate and noted how my hand wanted to round every letter as if smoothing a child's hair in a storm." Minor template cadence appears in the repeated "I [verb]" constructions mid-story, preventing higher scoring, but the closing sequence is flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Between lightning and thunder, the misty courtyard above clouds rang like a bowl of breath"). Some figurative density in peak beats ("hinge, opening what hurt") serves the lyric mode. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing around needs and wants that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and purposeful repetition of "On the [number] rise" creates rhythmic architecture. Information density high—most sentences advance discovery and emotional charge simultaneously. Deduction for occasional overwriting: "frost flowers lace the glass" and "coins across the metal" in adjacent lines; "warmly inquisitive" appears three times when twice would suffice.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in passages like "grief shaped the cumulonimbus ahead into a wall that looked quietly explosive."

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.7)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The heightened stillness trembles the dust into motes"). Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating toward closure. Some figurative language edges toward density ("hush arrives like a held breath") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("promise" used twice) and slight redundancy in describing the painting process.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("cordial nods, a kind of sociable isolation").

Clean prose with varied sentence structures supporting the contemplative-to-active arc.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("frost statues, patient and hauntingly bright").

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.4)
    Generally clean prose with good rhythm variation and purposeful compression. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "We argued, because hope here is brambled, and every stem hides a thorn" essentially restates difficulty twice. Template cadence in "We lowered...lifted...and kept talking" sequence. Some overwriting in metaphors like "the bell gave one long, dissolving ring that felt like rain inside our ribs."

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs ("I checked the bevel gears and saw an old brass tooth bent, pleading"). Some abstract phrases edge toward overwriting ("I was here to vouchsafe the world a few more unbroken heartbeats") but the overall texture remains controlled. Information density is strong, though occasional redundancy appears in the philosophical passages.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"I moved my hands through the air, leaving impressions without touching, coaxing doorways from absence" advances action while reinforcing the central motif. Some minor repetition of "impressions without touching" but it functions as pattern-teaching rather than loop.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "I diverged from my mentor, from my sister, from the consensus that stronger always meant better." Some figurative density in places ("loosened grief hung over the water like a mist the sun kept almost, but not quite, lifting") that slows momentum. Minor template cadence in the "I [verb]" pattern across several lines but not pervasive enough to seriously impede.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "blanks shaped like forgiveness" and varied sentence structures. However, some metaphoric density borders on overwriting ("the floor accepted us as a sentence accepts well-placed commas"), and occasional abstract constructions slow momentum ("The method was simple to describe and difficult to endure"). Information density remains high overall.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("coral should not live here, and yet here everything sturdy turns brittle when kept"). Some figurative density in peak beats but pattern-taught. Minor template cadence in "I tasted...I asked...I studied."

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.9)
    Prose shows strong moments like "ties it to a length of silken rope used for staging banners" with specific, purposeful detail. However, several abstract constructions weaken momentum: "her manner is vigorous tender" lacks a hyphen, "empathetically decisive" appears as label-speak, and some sentences pile modifiers ("patient knuckles," "borrowed starlight"). The multilingual counting provides rhythmic variation but occasionally feels performative rather than organic.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though some passages edge toward overwriting ("moonlit canyon trembled like a lung relearning breath"). Minor template cadence appears in "I saw...I felt...I steadied" sequence but doesn't pervade or touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The path bends like a cautious snake, counting my steps with ridged stones"). Some figurative density in high-pressure beats without full payoff ("seeds of vigilance, the currency that opens the patient vault"). Occasional abstract scaffolding ("Theme embraces complexity without false equivalence") that could be cut for momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The air keeps still as parchment, intensely quiet"). Some template repetition in "empathy in motion" (3x) and slight overwriting in metaphor density during quiet moments ("like sleepers adjusting quilts"), but propulsion maintains through varied syntax and purposeful paragraph rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong moments like "each silence between her moves spelled a letter I felt more than heard." Some density issues with exposition about the elders' covenant and occasional abstract phrasing ("difficult beauty survives"). The chess-magnetic field parallel creates good information density. Mild repetition of "silence" and "quiet" concepts without sufficient variation.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose maintains high information density with lines doing multiple jobs - "The bowl hums when struck, and the reed answers, and the mothwing waits at the threshold" advances action while establishing method and atmosphere. Some elevated diction ("firmament," "ceremoniousness") occasionally strains but serves the theatrical voice. Rhythm varies naturally between longer meditative passages and shorter action beats.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with strong imagery, but several abstract constructions slow momentum ("the turning of the tide's thought," "undercurrent of wisdom"). Some template cadence in the planting sequence. The final paragraph achieves excellent density where multiple elements converge.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("I am an accident investigator, rapidly adapting to the blankness that follows other people's alarms"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph lengths create visual rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.4)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("silence had weight, a mineral grace"). Some elevated diction risks register drift ("oscillating repose," "covenant of quiet") but remains mostly within the lyric mode. Sentence variety and paragraph rhythm create effective pacing. Deduction for occasional abstraction that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    Prose achieves strong imagery with "canyon hush pressed like velvet" and "worlds wove like strands drawn through a loom." However, several abstract passages lack concrete grounding ("failures I could not catalog away"), and some repetitive structures appear ("I had failed...I came back...I uncase").

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Between vanishing stars, I register the sheets and listen for the click of metal logic becoming breath"), though some passages contain mild paraphrase loops around the empathy concept. The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful fragments, with only occasional register elevation that slightly exceeds the POV's established range.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control, particularly in the ritual sequence. Information density is high with most sentences doing multiple jobs. Deduction for two instances of abstract phrasing ("shared membrane of palm and parcel," "fade from memory to myth") that momentarily blur concrete clarity, and one paraphrase loop around the mentor's teachings.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves moments of crystalline beauty ("The structure grew from the hill like frozen rain") with good rhythm variation.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with strong moments ("edges define a world") but frequent abstraction and elevated diction create opacity. Phrases like "patient frequency" and "letterless thought" strain clarity. The filter-verb stack ("felt," "knew," "smiled") in closure beats and some metaphor density ("cloth thinking") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("shadows slipping across hills of broken brick") but suffers from occasional density issues and abstract phrasing that slows momentum. Several passages contain near-paraphrase loops, particularly around the concept of "bartered awakenings," and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.2)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs—"The shard remembers the color of alarms, a planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass." Some repetitive phrasing appears ("redirect" variations, though thematically justified) and abstract constructions like "obedient to rhythms that reappear unbidden" occasionally slow momentum. The prose achieves moments of crystalline clarity in the revelation sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong figurative language serves the accumulative mode: "the reticent lighthouse supply skipper brings flour, oil, and silence."

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong moments like "Light tumbles down mirror angles, touches prisms, and roars out to sea like a bell made of dawn" show excellent rhythmic control. However, several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "I was accidentally prophetic" appears multiple times without variation.

    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"The labyrinth hummed as the maps formed, and the tower stopped leaking in every place I had not yet fixed" advances plot while embodying transformation. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful paragraph breaks. Minor deduction for occasional abstraction ("time was a tool we barely deserved") that could be more concrete.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density remains high with lines doing multiple jobs ("trees distilled regrets into fruit, and shadows braided their sap"), but template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" constructions and abstract philosophical insertions ("bound release" appears twice). The prose achieves moments of crystalline specificity ("waxy laughter still sticky") but occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("embarassed by its own thinning light") that creates register friction.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose achieves density with lines doing multiple jobs, but several template patterns emerge: "I [verb] because [reason]" structures repeat, and abstract phrases like "enlarged tranquility" appear twice unchanged. The "staying while leaving" formulation works conceptually but creates mild opacity in execution beats.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.3)
    Information-dense prose with lines doing multiple jobs ("The tea house had cloaked itself in moss and etiquette"). Strong rhythm variation and purposeful compression. Deductions for occasional overwriting in figurative density ("testing the patience of my heuristically gentle hands") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("sacred in the ordinary").

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasional abstraction dulls momentum ("meaning did not arrive as words").

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specificity ("damp tunnels, trusting spores and porters"). Some abstract loops appear ("Words unsent collect in my ribs like dust in louvers, and their absence dries everything I touch") and occasional template constructions ("I told him...," "I walked back...," "I watched...") create minor momentum drag.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves strong information density with lines like "He plants the heel of his foot at the pavilion's lip, and I open the pages" doing multiple jobs.

    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I set the oval on my tongue so it takes my warmth" combines action, sensation, and ritual. Some elevated diction ("serpentine grotto," "zephyr bloom") fits the lyric mode. Minor repetition of "patient/patience" but serves thematic accumulation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("I am a watchful dreamer by practice, not by choice"). Some metaphorical density in peak moments ("the numbers ticked like a Geiger counter under my ribs") occasionally approaches overwriting but remains coherent to the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery, though occasionally drifts into elevated register ("solemnized," "articulate") that strains against the intimate POV. Some metaphor density in peak beats ("pocketed star," "letter on the water") risks opacity without clear payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=6.8)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures supporting the lyric mode. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, abstract phrases like "filament of patient light" and "corners of my doubts softened" lack concrete grounding, and some metaphorical vehicles ("songs were maps") don't fully cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.4)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"frost traced his eyelashes" shows time passage, cold, and stillness simultaneously. Strong syntactic variety and rhythm control. Deduction for two instances of slight redundancy ("demonstrating patience physically" repeated) and minor abstraction in "moving stillness."

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Floods had bruised the orchards" establishes both setting and season economically. Some metaphorical density in early passages ("marble cavern exhaled a hush like cooled iron") and occasional abstract phrasing ("cellar of reason") create minor friction, but the technical precision and varied syntax maintain strong momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong figurative control with purposeful images that advance meaning ("cave breathed like a whale skeleton," "threads thinner than frost, each dyed with a different hush"), though occasional abstraction creeps in ("boundary-lessly trapped in unfinished orders"). Information density high—most lines do double work of atmosphere and progression.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs—"Steam ropes the air" evokes circus ropes while marking time's passage. Some minor repetition in "she refuses" constructions, but prose achieves strong momentum through varied sentence lengths and purposeful paragraph breaks that create visual rhythm matching emotional cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.9)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "My motives are simple and unbearable" compresses character and stakes efficiently. Rhythm varies naturally between long accumulative sentences and short declarations. Minor template cadence in the "I admit/forgive/promise/stay" sequence serves intentional pattern rather than artifact.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The terminal listened by changing, which is one form of gratitude"). Strong syntactic variety and purposeful rhythm shifts. Minor template patterns in middle technical sequence ("I rerouted... I flipped... I reversed...") but quickly broken. Final line achieves resonant closure through embodied action.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("crystal whispering forecourt after rain" establishes setting, atmosphere, and emotional state). Some repetitive phrasing ("excruciatingly gentle" twice, multiple "mask for" constructions) and occasional abstract loops ("to make peace with an abandoned dream" restated in final line). Prose rhythm varies effectively between long contemplative sentences and short decisive actions.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally clean prose with good momentum, though some abstract phrases ("architecture of lies," "hindsight clarity") appear multiple times without added pressure. Strong opening and closing lines. Minor template cadence in middle section ("I had come to salvage... I needed them to understand...").

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The glass is a conduit for listening, sand lightning remembers the path of charge"). However, abstract formulations appear in peak moments ("patience is not passivity," "attention is a sailor's prayer") and some paraphrase loops emerge ("I am infinitely patient" echoed later), preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs. Some metaphorical density borders on overwriting ("wavering light" that "remakes" the woman) but serves the accumulative mode. Minor template cadence in "She says...She gives me...She weeps" sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language serves the accumulative mode: "egg seemed to breathe whenever the palace shuddered." However, density occasionally overwhelms clarity—"whispered blue into cold steel" strains comprehension. Some paraphrase loops ("reawaken beauty"/"beauty reawakened"). Information density generally high but uneven pacing creates momentum drag in middle exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of genuine beauty ("black sand...like char that had learned to float after so many drownings of flame") with strong rhythmic control. However, several passages contain scaffold phrases and near-repetitions ("she had," "she wanted," "she would" openings) that create template cadence. The abstract phrase "unyielding compassion" appears three times without sufficient variation, and some metaphors stretch thin ("houses like riddles").

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery like "woman of water, veined with river maps" and efficient scene progression. Some repetitive constructions appear ("He walked," "He reached," "He spoke") and occasional abstraction ("realistically imaginative enough") slightly dulls momentum, but the closing image lands with clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose achieves high density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I release sonar pinging through the starlit mist" simultaneously establishes method, setting, and atmosphere. Some repetition of "generational patterns" and "light without fire" serves thematic accumulation rather than loops. Minor register elevation in places ("generational arithmetic of survival") occasionally strains but doesn't break voice coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs (butterflies as migration marker, craft guide, and maternal presence). Rhythm varies naturally between longer meditative passages and shorter declarative moments of action. Some abstract phrasing ("collective grief," "thundering calm") occasionally dulls immediacy, and there's minor repetition of "spectral mentorship" concept, but prose remains clear and propulsive through the closure sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("At the crest, there is the slightest stillness, a plank of silence laid across the century"). Some minor repetition around "incremental absolution" and occasional abstract phrasing ("ethically diligent beyond habit") that could be more concrete. No major loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information-dense prose with strong moments ("coins worn smooth, a glass needle, and scraps of thread that drink the lamplight") but occasional overwriting. Mixed metaphors muddle clarity: echoes as "migrating birds" forming a "choir" in consecutive lines. Some template cadence in middle sections ("He begins... He climbs... He recognizes...") dulls momentum though the closure beat remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally clean prose with varied sentence structures and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or stakes. Some metaphorical density in places ("rivers remembering," "winter star patience") without becoming purple. Minor scaffold in repeated "I + verb" constructions in middle sections.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "Night fell with thistled calm, soft but barbed" establishes time, atmosphere, and tension simultaneously. Some elevated diction ("thistled calm," "elusive song lyrics") serves the lyric mode effectively. Minor deduction for occasional abstract phrasing ("between grief and timber") and slight redundancy in dust/ash descriptions mid-story.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("The house exhales dust"). Some repetitive phrasing around "mirage of safety" and occasional abstract constructions ("the cost of surviving without a witness") that could be more embodied. Clear propulsion through varied sentence structures.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong propulsion through varied syntax and concrete imagery, but figurative density occasionally overwhelms ("the water remembers more than the people do," "a tooth from time itself"). Template cadence appears in the "Once, I rebuilt" / "Another time I proved" sequence, and some paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("These are not miracles; they are stubborn arithmetic" restates the philosophical stance).

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, though occasionally strains with constructions like "expectantly resigned" appearing without full integration. The recurring "traveled stillness" and "subtracting noise" create effective textural patterns. Some figurative density in peak moments ("curtains like patient throats, shelves breathing") borders on excessive but serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.2)
    Generally strong prose with vivid compression ("heavier than guilt," "memory less ash"), but several template-cadence runs appear ("I tasted...I spit...I knew...I clipped"). Some paraphrase loops in the pruning sequence. Information density high in most beats, supporting the accumulative structure despite these artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in world-building passages. Some abstract phrasing ("wonder prefers careful company," "ritual heals repetition") creates mild momentum drag, and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean, propulsive prose with high information density—nearly every line advances understanding or atmosphere. Some mild figurative density ("hushed blaze," "slack golden interval") but it serves the accumulative texture without obscuring meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied syntax. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. However, repetitive use of "cascading revelations" (appears 4 times) creates a loop. Some abstract constructions like "incisively kind" appear multiple times without variation. The "structural weakness" phrase also repeats mechanically. These patterns prevent entry to higher bands despite strong foundational craft.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.3)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "I am a grim optimist, balancedly daring" establishes character while echoing the required attribute. Strong syntactic variety and purposeful repetition ("proof," "proves," "proving") that accumulates meaning. Minor deduction for occasional abstract passages that slightly slow momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.6)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The brush drank moonlight as if it remembered the mouth of a river"). Some elevated diction borders on overwriting ("smog-choked city," "waxing moon's glow") but serves the lyric mode. Minor template cadence in middle section with repeated "She [verb]" constructions. Strong opening and closing lines anchor the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.3)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, character, and theme simultaneously. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("salt-tongued, feeling history tug like a hive-slick rope") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete. The "rosewater dread" feels forced rather than organic to the voice.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "My hands, neatly inventive, smelled of brass and boat pitch, and of the regret my tools could not file smooth." Some metaphor density in places ("blade of fog," "iron aftertaste") but serves the accumulative mode. Minor dock for occasional abstraction ("bleak exhilaration") and one filter-heavy sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong figurative language ("ferris skeleton like a dead whale nursing a glow") but occasional density excess in peak beats. Some paraphrase loops around the contradiction concept ("door means open when closed...closed when open"). Information density generally high but "unbosomed the truth" and similar elevated diction creates register drift.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "The mallet had once been a peg, then a drumstick, then a judge for planks." Some abstract moments ("fractal generating memories") slightly reduce clarity. Strong syntactic variety and rhythmic control throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.5)
    High information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "My mother led a lost expedition to question the silent watchers on the horizon, and never returned" establishes backstory, motivation, and stakes simultaneously. No loops or scaffolding; each image advances pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=6.8)
    Several paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "noble lies"/"mercy needs disguises" and the repetitive "I will publish" constructions in the final section. Strong moments like "the ivy shakes out a rain of seeds that tap my shoulders like shy reporters" demonstrate capability, but template cadence ("I write... I write...") dulls the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    Prose density is high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The submerged pavilion lies ahead, a lace of arches veiled by green water"), though several instances of abstract philosophizing dilute momentum ("to catalog the way emptiness braids itself through what remains"). The piece occasionally loops conceptually, restating the documentation theme without advancing pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.3)
    Prose achieves high information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("the stamp lay on felt, ordinary as a molar"). Some figurative density in early paragraphs ("wrists like a patient teacher," "shelves that ripple like kelp") slightly slows momentum but doesn't touch closure.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with vivid imagery ("catches sky like a spoon catches sugar"), though occasional overwriting appears ("luminous torment wrapped in patient hands"). Some metaphor density in early passages without clear payoff. The final paragraph maintains clarity and momentum through the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.8)
    Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("bleak exhilaration is honest," "intangibly tangible") and mild redundancy in the pooling concept across multiple paragraphs. The prose achieves moments of crystalline precision ("I knock the panel with my knuckles, and the geode crystal answers") but occasional opacity in metaphorical stretches reduces momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.3)
    Strong information density with most lines doing multiple jobs. Vivid, specific language ("cracked tiles, broken astrolabe teeth"). Some paraphrase loops ("The dome resists...brass gears sigh awake" could be condensed). Minor template cadence in middle section. No artifacts touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.3)
    Prose demonstrates strong control with varied syntax and purposeful imagery. Information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("curled into driftwood like letters addressed to no one") and some paraphrase loops around the forgery theme that don't add new pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    Strong opening establishes atmosphere and controlled metaphor throughout (parapet as "teeth," mist creating "furrowed hush"). Information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple story elements. Deduction for occasional overwriting ("shoulders drop as if armor exhaled through skin") and some repetitive phrasing around the drawer pull's temperature shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with vivid specific images ("shoes left small galaxies of mud"). However, several instances of abstract metaphor strain clarity: "backlash of regrets ruled my weather," "expectations collapse...like planks easing from a dock." Some filter constructions ("I felt the old arithmetic returning") could be more immediate.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.4)
    Information density high with lines doing multiple jobs ("The labyrinth of choices began at the rusted gate marked Donations Accepted"). Some template cadence in middle sections ("I told him...He pointed...I stepped") and occasional abstraction ("weaponized fatigue") prevent excellence, though the prose maintains momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=6.8)
    Dense figurative language occasionally obscures clarity ("the ribs where Mira once pressed her night-warm thumbs"). Template structures appear ("I tell her...She asks...I realize...") disrupting flow. Strong moments like "cumin for laughter, clove for bite" demonstrate specificity, but overwriting in phrases like "arithmetic of grief" and "reluctant as dawn behind a mountain" accumulates.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=6.8)
    Strong imagery and varied syntax, but several instances of abstract phrasing ("willingly perplexed," "choking beauty") and mild redundancy in the confession sequence. Some lines achieve high density ("Every step downward sounded like an unsaid apology") while others lean toward ornamental metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong moments of compression ("The ship was a quilt of hulls and histories") but several passages contain abstract loops: "waiting for a reader to pledge to carry both" followed by "I promised...to only unseal what could be tended" paraphrases the same content. Some filter-heavy constructions ("I realized," "I felt") dull immediacy in middle beats. The opening and closing lines effectively bookend with "ghostly resolve."

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.5)
    Prose demonstrates strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "She was a destitute philanthropist who gave away money until it left, then gave away time, then finally gave away coincidence" establishes character, backstory, and thematic frame simultaneously. Some metaphorical density approaches overwriting ("revised stars practicing new steps in that vast choreography") but serves the lyrical mode. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs ("Messages move via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial"). Minor template cadence in middle sections ("I kneel and let...," "We walk the coded angles...") and occasional overwrought metaphor ("medals dreaming of their own reflections") prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=6.8)
    Prose achieves moments of striking imagery ("the sea sang like wire drawn through sky") but suffers from density issues in peak beats, with figurative language appearing in most sentences without always advancing pressure. Some passages loop conceptually ("promises linger like delayed thunder" followed by extended promise meditation), and filter constructions occasionally dull immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.6)
    Generally strong prose with memorable phrases like "metronome for lightning" and "storm stepping back to the horizon." Deductions for density issues: overuse of figurative language in high-pressure beats (-0.5), occasional register drift into elevated diction beyond the POV's natural voice (-0.3), and some mixed metaphors that muddle clarity (-0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.4)
    Generally strong prose with purposeful metaphorical density that serves the philosophical conceit. Information density is high with lines doing multiple jobs. Deductions for occasional overwriting ("dignified chaos that kept time on the pulse in my throat") and some abstract phrasing that could be more concrete ("invitation to accidents").

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.3)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs: "We string twine between shelves and fence, clip poems to it with clothespins, and the lines lift like prayer flags." Minor metaphor density in places ("stupid and holy," "luminous fracture") but generally controlled. No loops or scaffolding detected.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.5)
    Strong information density with lines doing multiple jobs, particularly in descriptions like "a tidal arbor above the clouds, its branches braided with ropes of foam." Syntactic variety serves the dreamlike atmosphere. However, some abstract phrasing ("steely longing," "drift and drifted time") and occasional redundancy ("pauses," "latecomers," "space between doors" in the playing sequence) prevent higher scoring. The prose maintains momentum despite these moments.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong imagery density and propulsion, though some metaphorical clusters approach overwriting ("bruise of approaching rain," "metronome of recollection"). The prose maintains momentum through varied syntax and purposeful compression. Occasional abstraction ("memory broke when people mistook whispers for lineage") could ground more concretely.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.2)
    Strong rhythm control and information density, but several paraphrase loops weaken momentum ("I spoke, not to summon forgiveness, but to find the color within the shape of the saying. / I said the words I should have said"). Some elevated diction strains POV credibility ("ferried myself," "quotidian salvage"). The "rhythmically placid" repetition works as taught pattern but borders on excessive.

Sentence structure varies to match the story's pacing, from the patient draping of kalimba notes to the hushed stillness of totality. The piece is exceptionally clean, with no discernible loops or scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exquisite, characterized by high information density, startlingly fresh figurative language ("dust flurries like moths, each wing a different year returning"), and a controlled, patient rhythm. The sentences are crafted with immense care and propel the quiet narrative forward. While the style is dense and poetic, it remains clear and purposeful, never slipping into overwriting for its own sake. A slight repetition in the description of the diaries is the only hairline imperfection in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.5)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless. Information density is exceptionally high, with sentences like "The night did not explode; it unfolded, neat as a bill" doing immense work in a small space.

    The prose is dense, precise, and evocative, with zero wasted words or scaffolding. Figurative language is consistently surprising and effective ("recorded like frost," "winked like a tiny bruise," "air became a visible ladder"). Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to control momentum, slowing for the priest's methodical setup and tightening as the pressure on the entity builds. This is clean, high-impact prose with no discernible artifacts.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating masterful control of rhythm, syntax, and imagery. Information density is high, with each sentence working to advance atmosphere, character, and action simultaneously. While the language is consistently elevated and figurative, it never feels overwritten; instead, it serves the specific, lyrical mode of the piece. The read-aloud quality is flawless, with no awkward phrasing or momentum-killing constructions to be found.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, lyrical, and demonstrates high command of rhythm and syntax, creating a dense, immersive texture. Information density is excellent, with most sentences serving multiple functions. The figurative language is largely brilliant, though its sheer volume occasionally pushes the boundary of overwriting, risking opacity for effect. The momentum and clarity hold firm through the closure, but the piece succeeds due to its sustained high-wire act, not because it is entirely without risk.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is ambitious, rhythmically sophisticated, and demonstrates high information density. The figurative language is largely brilliant and integrated. The score is held back from the highest tier by the final paragraph, which shifts from the potent "showing" of the central scene to "telling" the outcome and its future implications, slightly reducing the momentum of the otherwise powerful ending.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, lyrical, and surgically precise. Every sentence works to advance story, character, and atmosphere, demonstrating exceptional information density without feeling overwritten.

The piece is entirely free of loops, scaffolding, or other prose artifacts, demonstrating meticulous line-level craft.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense, with a varied and compelling rhythm. While the figurative language is consistently inventive, its sheer density sometimes approaches the edge of being overwritten, particularly with aphoristic phrasing like "the serial excuses we call progress." This density, while largely successful, prevents the prose from achieving the highest tier of flawless clarity under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, with exceptional information density and rhythmic control. While consistently elevated and metaphorical, it avoids feeling overwrought because the figurative language is always purposeful and tied to the story's core logic ("the smoke learned to sink," "apples bloom white scars"). There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding. The final lines, in particular, demonstrate perfect cadence, bringing the story to a close that feels both inevitable and musically resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.9)
    The line-level craft is nearly flawless. The prose is dense with original, striking figurative language ("a little fox of static," "light thinned into tea") that is always functional, building the world and advancing the emotional state. There are no wasted words, no scaffolding, and no rhythmic monotony. Information density is extremely high, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs—advancing plot, deepening character, and enriching atmosphere—with what appears to be effortless grace.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is consistently elegant and inventive, with high information density and striking images like "bookmarks winds and straightens the horizon line." The rhythm is controlled and supports the story's gentle momentum. The primary weakness is a tendency toward overwriting; the density of figurative language occasionally feels excessive, with nearly every sentence carrying a metaphor or simile, which can slightly dull the impact of the most powerful images.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking imagery, creating a powerful, immersive texture. However, the figurative language is so consistently high-register that it occasionally verges on overwriting, risking density over momentum. A line like "...which is to say I listen until I feel tenderized by strangers" uses a scaffolding phrase that slightly dilutes the power of an otherwise potent voice.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptional quality, demonstrating high information density and rhythmic propulsion without a single wasted word. Figurative language is fresh and precise, consistently deepening atmosphere and character (“silence that clocks fear,” “borrowed seconds curled around my wrists like steam”).

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently brilliant, marked by high information density and striking figurative language. However, the density is so consistently high that it occasionally borders on being overwrought, slightly impeding momentum. A line like "His conjuring is secretive not by cowardice but by craft" reads as a slightly too-neat authorial assertion, a minor register shift in an otherwise seamless performance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.2)
    The line-level craft is exquisite, with high information density and evocative, original metaphors. The prose propels the quiet narrative with a steady, hushed momentum. A minor deduction is warranted for the slightly clumsy repetition of the phrase "while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage" near the end; its re-use at the moment the power returns creates a small dissonance in an otherwise flawless execution.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=9.5)
    Line-level craft is superb. The prose is dense with meaning, with each sentence working to advance character, atmosphere, or theme without a single wasted word or clichéd image.

There are no loops, scaffolding, or rhythmic missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and rhythmic, maintaining a high level of craft from start to finish. The figurative language ("knives newly honest about their work," "a gnat hung like a black comma") is almost always precise and powerful. While the sheer density of metaphor borders on overwriting in a few spots ("tides reason"), it coheres as a deliberate, voice-driven style rather than an artifact. There are no wasted words or momentum-dulling loops; every sentence contributes to the story's potent atmosphere and forward pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is gorgeous and propulsive, with striking, memorable phrases. However, the prose is hampered by its own richness; the density of figurative language in the climactic sequence is so high that it verges on overwriting, slightly dulling the impact of individual metaphors. A minor paraphrase loop ("through overlapping shadows") also appears, though it feels somewhat intentional within the incantatory rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, lyrical, and precise. Figurative language is consistently fresh and effective, as in "I take notes like salt takes shape in a handprint, brief and true until the next wave."

The clarity and propulsion are flawless, particularly in the final beats where the prose builds to a quiet, powerful crescendo.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with remarkable information density and rhythmic control. Nearly every line is load-bearing, advancing the story's accumulative logic through vivid, precise imagery. While the density of figurative language is extremely high, it remains coherent and purposeful, avoiding the trap of overwriting by ensuring each metaphor sharpens rather than obscures the emotional core of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is consistently stunning, characterized by high information density and resonant, precise imagery. Figurative language is abundant but rarely feels overwritten because it is so tightly bound to the story's core conceits (patterns, tides, stars). There are no discernible loops, redundancies, or scaffolding. A minor deduction for the sheer density, which in one or two moments slightly risks tipping from evocative into ornate, but this is a high-wire act that almost never falters.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, but it remains controlled, precise, and consistently serves the story’s voice and otherworldly atmosphere. The sentence-level rhythm is varied and propulsive, and there are no instances of scaffolding, loops, or wasted words.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative imagery. Sentences are crafted for maximum impact without becoming overwritten, such as, "Her name collects in my mouth like iron, but I still cannot say it, because the certificate made it illegal for me to remember." There are no discernible loops, scaffolding, or prose artifacts; every line serves the story's atmosphere and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently inventive and rhythmically complex. However, the sheer density of figurative language, with a metaphor or simile in nearly every sentence, borders on overwriting. While the imagery is often brilliant, this relentless texture sacrifices moments of quiet clarity and risks feeling effortful, preventing an otherwise masterful performance from achieving a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is immaculate, demonstrating high information density where nearly every sentence serves character, world, and theme simultaneously. Figurative language is fresh, consistent with the story's aquatic/organic motif, and never overwritten ("rafts realigned like ribs taking a breath").

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates high information density with no scaffolding. However, its reliance on figurative language is so consistently high that it borders on being overwritten, occasionally calling attention to its own craft. The repetition of the "beads" metaphor ("beads slid along a string," "beads across the bowls") is a minor but noticeable slip in an otherwise masterfully controlled piece.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control. While the density of figurative language is immense ("a mouth that swallowed maps," "valves like hard hearts," "a quorum of thawed decisions"), it functions as the story's foundational aesthetic rather than overwriting. Each sentence works to advance the narrative's unique textural reality without a single wasted word, loop, or clunky construction, resulting in a piece that is both crystalline and profoundly evocative.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density, with sentences that simultaneously advance action, build atmosphere, and reveal character.

    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional line-level craft, with fresh and powerful figurative language. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful, driving the story’s meditative pace. The score is held back from the highest tier only by the sheer density of metaphor, which at times borders on overwriting, and a minor paraphrase loop (“not the absence of sound but the place where sound surrenders to listening”) that could be tightened.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional craft and control. While intensely figurative, it avoids incoherence; the metaphors are internally consistent and serve the story's fairy-tale logic. Sentence structure and rhythm are varied to create a compelling, almost incantatory momentum. There are no technical flaws, loops, or wasted words; every line contributes to the dense, evocative atmosphere, showcasing a high degree of information and emotional density.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is luminous, dense, and propulsive, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. The rhythm and syntax are varied and controlled, creating a powerful lyric effect. A minuscule deduction is for a couple of phrases where the figurative language becomes slightly overwrought, such as barnacles releasing "rusted earrings," which momentarily pulls attention to the artifice in an otherwise seamless piece. This is a hairline flaw that doesn't touch the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, poetic, and consistently beautiful, with high information density in every line. Sentences like "starlings circled like punctuation over sentences the earth kept revising" are world-class.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, with high information density and striking, original imagery. However, its reliance on heavy figuration in nearly every sentence borders on overwriting. While the effect aligns with the "vivid" character's voice and the story's lyrical aims, a touch more restraint in less critical moments could have heightened the impact of the most powerful images. There are no technical errors, loops, or scaffolds; the high score reflects the craft, with a slight deduction for the sheer, unvaried density of the figurative language.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating exceptional information density and rhythmic control. Figurative language is fresh, coherent, and purposeful, never ornamental ("every whisper returns dressed in someone else's coat"). The structural repetition of "In the pause between question and reply" provides a powerful, incantatory cadence that propels the narrative forward without a single wasted word or false note.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and demonstrates exceptional control over rhythm and figurative language, with nearly every sentence doing multiple jobs. The line "a message should be heavier than a lie" verges on being slightly too explicit in a story that otherwise operates on masterful subtlety, but it is grounded in a physical sensation. Overall, the line-level craft is superb, with no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding, creating a powerful and propulsive reading experience.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is luminous and demonstrates high information density, with most lines serving character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally risks feeling overwrought, particularly in lists of metaphorical conversions ("salt to sugar, insomnia to song"). This intense layering slightly impedes momentum in a few spots, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense and highly figurative, a risk that pays off through stunning precision and coherence. Each metaphor ("humming with foxglove regret," "wick a mothwing of cooled thunder") deepens the atmosphere and character without sacrificing clarity. The sentences have a rare combination of musicality and forward momentum, demonstrating supreme line-level craft with no discernible artifacts or overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, elegant, and highly polished. Figurative language is both beautiful and functional, consistently reinforcing the central themes ("ink breathing into letters shaped like opened doors").

Every sentence is propulsive, carrying significant emotional and thematic weight with remarkable economy.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is exceptionally dense with figurative language, yet it maintains absolute clarity and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, lyrical, and demonstrates a high level of craft, with excellent rhythm and information density. However, its greatest strength—the richness of its figurative language—occasionally creates a density that borders on overwriting. In a few places, metaphors are stacked in a way that slightly slows momentum rather than sharpens it ("Light moves like patient fish, cheerful yet full of dignified midnight"). These are minor instances in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=9.7)
    The prose is of the highest caliber: dense, lyrical, and precise without a single wasted word or overwrought image. Sentences are rhythmically varied and consistently propelled by strong verbs and startling, original metaphors ("moonlight washing his badge into an old lake").

    The prose is ambitious, dense, and almost uniformly excellent. The rhythm and syntax are controlled with an expert hand, varying to match the scene's needs. Information density is high, with nearly every line performing multiple functions. The only minor friction is that the figurative language occasionally becomes so dense that it verges on abstraction, slightly softening the impact of a few lines. However, this is a minor quibble in an otherwise brilliant and polished piece of writing with no technical errors.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose demonstrates exceptional clarity, density, and propulsion. Figurative language is rich and inventive ("gossip sketches currents," "noctilucent reckonings") without ever obscuring meaning or momentum, even in the most lyrical passages. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to character, atmosphere, or the story's forward movement toward its final, clear resolve.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is luminous, marked by rhythmic variety, strong verbs, and fresh, powerful figurative language ("the valley burned like a sentence unfinished"). However, a notable prose artifact prevents a higher score: the conceptual loop of "enlighten" and "reflecting deeply." This repetition across different parts of the narrative feels like authorial scaffolding and slightly dulls the otherwise impeccable finish of the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, demonstrating remarkable information density and sentence-level propulsion. Word choice is consistently precise and evocative ("needle's etiquette," "serene upheaval").

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=9.3)
    The prose is dense, lyrical, and highly crafted, with exceptional rhythmic control. While figurative language is pervasive, it is the story's taught, consistent aesthetic rather than an artifact of overwriting.

The result is a piece with immense information density and propulsion.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is of exceptionally high quality, with dense, evocative, and original figurative language ("puddle of moon," "smoke that forgot its fire").

The sentences have a propulsive, poetic rhythm that serves the story's reflective mood perfectly, with no wasted words or scaffolding phrases.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is ambitious, elegant, and highly figurative, with a strong, varied rhythm. The information density is high. Its only minor weakness is a slight tendency toward self-commentary, as when the phrase "building temporary structures as signals" is repeated in the resolution, feeling more like a concluding thesis statement than a purely narrative beat. This minor artifact slightly dulls the otherwise sharp execution.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=9.5)
    The prose is immaculate. Sentences are dense with meaning, advancing character, atmosphere, and action simultaneously. There is no overwriting, scaffolding, or redundancy; every word is purposeful. Figurative language is fresh and coherent, such as the aurora becoming a "blade that carved quick shadow notes."

There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence carries weight.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous, with high information density and precise, inventive figurative language ("violet silk torn to ribbons"). There are no wasted words or technical flaws. The only hairline imperfection is a slight tendency in the final paragraphs toward thematic summary ("People will call it superstition... I call it keeping faith"), which, while beautifully phrased, verges on over-articulating the story's core ideas rather than letting them rest entirely in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is exquisite, marked by rhythmic variety, high information density, and stunningly precise imagery ("smiles like a door learning it was always a window"). The prose is polished to a mirror shine. A fractional deduction is applied for the sheer density of figurative language; at times, the profusion of metaphors and similes in nearly every sentence risks feeling overwrought, slightly diminishing the impact of the most powerful images.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is exquisite, with a high density of fresh, precise, and evocative figurative language that rarely falters. Sentences are rhythmically varied and purposeful, propelling the narrative through texture and image. A minor flaw is a slight drift into abstraction near the end (e.g., "harshness had once pretended to be order"), which momentarily dilutes the potent specificity that characterizes the rest of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is lyrical and dense with meaning, demonstrating strong rhythmic control and syntactic variety. Sentences like "Leaves loosened with little sighs, vows letting go the way grief sometimes does when you breathe half a second longer" are both beautiful and purposeful. The prose is nearly flawless, but a minor deduction is applied for a slight tendency towards uniform figurative density, where almost every observation is heightened, and for the final sentence which functions as a clarifying summary rather than propelled action or image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.9)
    The line-level craft is of a very high quality, marked by inventive, precise figurative language and a controlled, lyrical rhythm. The information density is excellent, with nearly every sentence serving multiple functions. The score is held back slightly by the concluding paragraphs, where phrases like "he understood that his job was to..." function as strategic telling that feels more like summary than a final, imagistic turn of the screw.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density, with most sentences advancing atmosphere and idea simultaneously. While the figurative language is incredibly rich, its sheer density occasionally verges on overwhelming the narrative momentum, but it never breaks its own established logic.

    The prose is elegant and precise, with high information density. However, the density of figurative language, while often stunning, occasionally verges on being overwritten, slightly slowing momentum with its richness. A few moments in the resolution lean toward summarizing the emotional outcome ("I sensed the city settle into a kinder rhythm") rather than letting the prior images do the work alone, a minor slip in an otherwise masterfully crafted piece.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is dense, figurative, and consistently polished, demonstrating high information density and sentence-level propulsion.

While the vast majority of lines are sharp and evocative, a small handful of images, like the sun's coins of heat "that pretended they were just another cloud," feel slightly less focused than the surrounding prose. However, these are hairline imperfections in an otherwise pristine and propulsive piece with zero scaffolding or redundancy.

    The prose is dense, evocative, and largely flawless, with high information density and a varied, compelling rhythm. Each sentence works to advance the story's unique atmosphere. A minor deduction is warranted for a single instance of a potentially mixed metaphor ("bones softening like wax... knuckles to rain") and a general prose style so consistently elevated that it occasionally borders on overwriting, though this is largely a successful stylistic risk.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.6)
    The prose is of the highest caliber—dense, evocative, and controlled.

    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language that is largely successful and evocative ("rain like threaded needles"). The sentences are crafted with a strong rhythmic sense and high information density. However, in a few moments, the sheer volume of metaphor slightly thickens the prose, approaching the edge of overwriting without quite crossing it, a hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.1)
    The line-level craft is virtuosic, with high information density and precise, evocative word choice. The prose avoids cliché and builds momentum through its rhythmic and sensory richness. The sheer density of figurative language is a high-risk, high-reward strategy that largely succeeds, but occasionally feels slightly overwrought, as if performing its own lyricism rather than letting an image breathe.

    The prose is luminous and dense with precisely deployed imagery. The figurative language ("verbs that rustle like moths," "grammar cried for land") is consistently brilliant and serves the story's unique atmosphere. There are no wasted words or movements.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense with figurative language, yet remains clear and purposeful, creating a lush, immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in its imagery. However, its relentless lyricism borders on being overwritten; figurative language saturates nearly every sentence, occasionally creating a density that impedes momentum. Lines like "snagging briefly on distances inside his ribs" or "wind answers with laughter sharper than he can bear" are powerful, but their frequency creates a texture so rich it can feel overwrought, a stylistic choice that slightly compromises clarity for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is exceptionally beautiful and demonstrates elite-level craft, with high information density and precise, surprising imagery ("bats delete gnats from the air, leaving a margin for fragrance"). However, the figurative language is so relentless, with metaphors and similes packed into nearly every sentence, that it occasionally risks feeling overwrought. While this density is part of its stylistic signature, a demanding editor would note that a slight easing in peak moments might have allowed key images to land with even greater force.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=9.3)

    The prose is polished to a mirror shine, with high information density and evocative figurative language. The rhythm is controlled and purposeful, accelerating and slowing with the character's internal state. A slight deduction is made for a few moments where the intellectual density risks becoming an assertion rather than an embodied experience, such as "life adds probabilities that cancel until a different sum appears," but this is a minor flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is lyrical and inventive, with high information density in most lines.

Some sentences function as poetic restatements of the previous sentence's concept, creating minor conceptual loops that slightly impede momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.9)
    The prose is elegant and rhythmically controlled, but its reliance on dense figurative language borders on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, which, while often beautiful, creates a uniform texture that can slightly dull the emotional immediacy of key moments.

    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high informational density, syntactic variety, and startlingly fresh figurative language. The prose propels the narrative with a quiet, confident momentum. A single line, "He used silent empathy the way other men used keys," functions as a minor thematic label in a piece that otherwise demonstrates this idea entirely through action, a hairline flaw in an otherwise pristine surface.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is dense, evocative, and almost entirely free of artifacts. Figurative language is consistently inventive ("library walls drank our breath like paper drinks light," "streets quieted until we could hear our shoes thinking").

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prose is luminous, with high information density and striking, original figurative language ("a monastery that forgot its prayers and learned the patience of glaciers"). However, this very strength occasionally tips into overwriting. The sheer density of metaphors in some passages, with multiple figures packed into single sentences, can feel slightly labored, momentarily prioritizing style over momentum and clarity. Otherwise, the craft is superb.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and often beautiful, with high information density in every line. However, the sheer relentlessness of the figurative language borders on overwriting. Nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor, which, while high quality, slightly flattens the prose's dynamic range and creates a uniform rhythm. This stylistic choice is consistently executed but holds it back from the highest echelon.

The line-level craft is otherwise immaculate, with varied rhythms and zero scaffolding.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is incredibly dense and ambitious, operating at a very high level of craft. While the figurative language is almost uniformly stunning, a few phrases like "transliterates emotions the way a dry river reads rain" slightly favor poetic abstraction over immediate sensory clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prose is luminous and dense with striking, original imagery. However, the story is marked by a recurring prose artifact: the slightly awkward, verbatim repetition of "through public art installation" three times. This phrase feels like undisguised scaffolding from a prompt, disrupting the otherwise exquisite flow and calling attention to the authorial hand. While the rest of the line-level craft is nearly flawless, this repeated stumble prevents a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is intricate and beautiful, with high information density in every line. However, the sheer, relentless cascade of figurative language occasionally risks overwhelming momentum, pushing the boundaries of the rubric’s overwriting checks.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.8)
    The line-level craft is consistently strong, with high information density and evocative, precise language. There are no technical errors, loops, or scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious, elegant, and rhythmically complex, with high information density in every line. There are no technical errors, loops, or lazy constructions. The only point of friction is the sheer, unremitting density of its figurative language; while often brilliant, it occasionally risks feeling overwrought, where a moment of plainer language might have provided powerful contrast. This is a stylistic choice of the highest caliber, but one that slightly taxes momentum in a few places.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.9)
    The prose is of the highest caliber, demonstrating exceptional information density and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.5)
    The prose is evocative and dense with imagery, demonstrating strong line-level craft. The rhythm and syntax are controlled and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is ambitious and often stunning, with high information density and evocative imagery. However, its relentless figurative richness occasionally borders on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and demonstrates high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.6)
    The line-level craft is consistently elegant and demonstrates high information density. However, the prose is so saturated with figurative language that it occasionally feels overwrought, risking a loss of propulsion. The final paragraphs lean into explanation, summarizing the protagonist's new state rather than letting the final actions and images carry the full weight of the transformation, a minor but noticeable scaffolding at the end.

    The prose is luminous, with high information density and a varied, lyrical rhythm. While the density of figurative language is exceptionally high ("scintillatingly somber choir," "hummingbird trapped in duty"), it remains coherent and serves as an integral part of the narrator's philosophical voice rather than feeling like an applied layer. There are no wasted words, loops, or scaffolding; every sentence contributes to the story's texture and momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.1)
    The prose is elegant, dense, and propelled by strong verbs and vivid, original imagery ("a herd of hammers," "a final snow of denial"). The line-level craft is exceptional throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    The prose is elegant and dense with well-crafted imagery and rhythm. However, two minor flaws are present: the phrase "fleshly ethereal" is used twice, which feels like a rare oversight in an otherwise controlled piece. Additionally, the line "Not erasing the need... only letting it ring in a kinder register" is a paraphrase loop that restates the previous sentence's concept ("Sonic absolution... a way of tuning yourself") without adding new information.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.4)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density, rhythmic control, and precise, evocative figurative language ("unyoke another yapping urgency from the sled of my thoughts").

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=9.0)
    The line-level craft is superb, marked by high information density, potent imagery, and varied sentence rhythms. There are no loops or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is consistently beautiful and rhythmically controlled, with high information density in every line. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense—nearly every sentence contains a simile or metaphor—that it borders on overwriting in a few moments ("zephyr bloom," "gentle handwriting," "milk into tea"). While the imagery is almost always effective and voice-consistent, a slight pulling back would have allowed the most powerful images to land with even greater force. It's a hairline flaw in an otherwise stellar execution.

    The line-level craft is superb, characterized by inventive, precise metaphors and high information density. The prose propels the narrative with a confident, lyrical rhythm. The only slight hesitation is the sheer density of figurative language; while beautiful, in some passages it risks calling attention to itself at the expense of transparency, a high-wire act that it almost entirely sustains.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.0)
    The prose is ambitious, dense with figurative language that is a core part of its aesthetic and world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious and frequently stunning, with high information density and a varied, compelling rhythm. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally feels performative, threatening to overshadow the emotional core (e.g., regret gathering barnacles). While this is part of the story's taught, lyrical style, a few moments of greater restraint in the peak beats would have elevated it to true flawlessness.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.5)

    The prose is elegant and dense with imagery, demonstrating high-level craft in rhythm and word choice. The piece is nearly flawless at the line level, with no significant artifacts or redundancies.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is meticulously crafted, with high information density and a varied, musical rhythm. However, the figurative language is so consistently dense that it occasionally risks drawing attention to its own artistry, bordering on overwriting.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.9)
    The prose is ambitious, dense, and largely successful, with a powerful rhythm and high information density.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.7)
    The prose is ambitious and often brilliant, with high information density and striking figurative language ("knots sit like punctuation in a stubborn sentence"). However, the density occasionally verges on overwriting, particularly in the opening sentences. A phrase like "exhales a hush that sounds like velvet unwinding from a well-kept secret" is beautiful but risks overwhelming the reader with multiple layers of metaphor. This slight lack of restraint in a few key moments is the only element holding the craft back from perfection.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=9.4)
    The prose is polished, dense, and almost entirely free of artifacts. Figurative language is consistently striking and purposeful, such as the snow like a "quill testing paper for flaws."

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.5)
    The line-level craft is ambitious and largely successful, with arresting, high-density images and a controlled, lyrical rhythm. The prose is a significant strength. A minor deduction is warranted for the sheer saturation of figurative language, which at times verges on overwriting, and for a single instance of abstract, therapeutic language ("crystallize a fleeting emotion") that feels like a slight prose artifact in a pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=9.8)
    The prose is remarkably dense and precise, with every line doing significant work to advance character, atmosphere, and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.2)
    The prose is dense and often beautiful, with strong verbs and evocative imagery. However, two distinct prose artifacts prevent a higher score. The aforementioned "synaptic plasticity" line is a severe register drift that breaks the established voice. Additionally, the moments of thematic summary function as scaffolding that should have been cut, momentarily halting momentum to explain what the narrative is already demonstrating.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The prose is ambitious and largely brilliant, with high information density and rhythmic control. The language creates a potent, immersive texture. However, the final sentence ("I revealed the hidden tray because truth leaves no pocket for delay") is a notable flaw, creating a paraphrase loop that summarizes a past action with a clunky aphorism right after a stronger, more resonant image, slightly dulling the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    The prose is luminous, with high information density and a stunning command of figurative language. The rhythm is controlled and sentences are beautifully constructed to serve the hushed, intense atmosphere. A fractional deduction accounts for one or two similes that border on precious, a hairline crack in an otherwise flawless surface, such as "creeping normality rehearsed by a heart."

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=9.7)
    The line-level craft is exceptional, marked by high information density and lyrical precision. Figurative language is not ornamental but foundational to the story's world-building and momentum, as in "truth relocated itself like water finding lower ground."
