  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's evolved perspective ("Your dust patterns—they're like tree rings") demonstrates genuine transformation with professional cost (colleagues' confusion). The accumulative lens holds consistently through dust pattern observations building to paradigm shift. Slight weakness in cost legibility - the professional stakes could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Lirael's decision to teach others to "read the frost" and find "scorched testaments," with visible cost in abandoning traditional glasswork. The accumulative structure coheres through frost/fire/glass patterns, though the smuggler backstory feels slightly disconnected from the final revelation about pauses.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lirael redefines music as vibration rather than sound, with visible cost (her lost voice) transformed into artistic purpose. The accumulative structure builds through repeated tuning fork experiments toward breakthrough. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. Minor deduction for slight looseness in the middle third's pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias finds his "permanent address" underwater, with clear cost (abandoning his life above). The accumulative structure coheres well through the lens metaphor—broken/mended/shining—though the dream sequences feel slightly disconnected from the main causality. The orientation anchors cleanly by ~120 words, and the closure lands with both felt and conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the community transforms from anonymous survival to named solidarity, with visible cost in lost donations but gained connection. The accumulative structure coheres through the bell's transformation from silent relic to daily celebration. Minor causality wobble: the widow's "You knew" feels unearned given Mira's public declaration rather than private knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lira's journey building toward a Conceptual Repricing about where unused love is stored. However, the closure—"love...simply waited for the right moment to be revealed"—arrives through abstract realization rather than dramatized cost, and the breathing method's mechanics remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=6.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Elara's understanding shift and the photographs' transformation from fading to glowing. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual—while the halo fragment becomes "dull and inert," we don't see what Elara specifically loses or sacrifices beyond her initial quest, weakening the closure's emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change when Lirael breaks her chains and releases the seeds, with visible cost in her imprisonment and the world's broken state. The causal lens holds through puzzle-solving leading to vault access leading to seed release. The "wall coming down" trigger feels somewhat arbitrary and could be more causally integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through collected absences toward Lira creating the hearing aid that captures betrayal's frequency. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she experiences the amplified absence "where love should be," with cost visible in her being "battered but marveling." The forge-to-forging progression and memory-harvesting create clear causality, though the father's disappearance backstory slightly exceeds the 20% reflection allowance.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively—the jar transforms rather than takes, converting theft into exchange with visible cost (the wilted lily, the given photograph). The accumulative structure builds through symbolic layers (lily codes, starlight, moonbeams) toward this reversal. Slight deduction because the cost could be more viscerally felt beyond the symbolic lily.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the thawing metaphor, building from physical ice melting to emotional/philosophical thaw, with the bookmark's crack serving as the central image that reweights from flaw to "map." The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's acceptance of imperfection, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we understand but don't fully feel the price of abandoning certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a causal drive lens with clear because/therefore linkages from discovery to confrontation to resolution. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lila's relationship to vulnerability fundamentally shifts, with visible cost in confronting both enforcer and mother. However, the mother's survival revelation and the mob boss subplot resolution through news article feel mechanically convenient rather than dramatically earned.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern intensification through layered silences building to the map's completion. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the map transforms from physical guide to temporal/existential one, with clear cost in the fort's darkness and Mara's acceptance of oblivion's edge. The "who/where/when" anchors establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Conceptual Repricing as Unit-17 discovers thoughts arise from "the mundane...the mysticism of the everyday," with the cost being the weight of infinite knowledge. However, the temporal loop mechanics feel convenient rather than earned through prior causality, and the scientist's return reads as exposition rather than dramatic necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's transformation from record-keeper to translator, with visible cost in abandoning written logs for doodled invitations. The accumulative lens holds as details (crystals humming, lens revealing messages) build toward meaning-shift. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two, though the "after words become unnecessary" timeframe remains conceptually vague rather than dramatically present.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story establishes its accumulative/textural lens through the marble-polishing ritual and vine-tending, but lacks a decisive closure with visible cost—Joren's adoption of a marble suggests change without showing what he sacrifices or how the maze actually "remembers." The final image of the maze blooming "because of" wounds attempts resonance but doesn't demonstrate the claimed transformation on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal lens holds: nexus activation causes flora awakening, overcompensation causes destabilization, recalibration restores control. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Veyra reaching for the lever again with newfound drive—though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The director's "we're not done yet" crystallizes future stakes without a decisive change occurring on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Charged Poise closure lands with Clara's promise carrying felt cost - she's committing to complete a dead composer's work. The accumulative lens holds as details build toward this crystallized moment. Deducting for slight orientation delay (who Clara is takes too long to establish) and because the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lirael's acceptance of uncertainty ("learned to sway... let the margins occupy her"), with visible cost in abandoning her role. The accumulative lens holds as botanical imagery, margins, and fault-tolerance build toward the ending's reconfiguration. Slight weakness in the quarantine folder reveal, which could have been more dramatically integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from tunnel entry through valve discovery to revelation, with the hologram providing a Decisive Change that reframes the mill's collapse from accident to cover-up. The cost lands explicitly: "human failure, amplified by greed and fear" becomes Elias's burden, though the hologram's convenient exposition slightly weakens the earned quality of the revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where the keeper achieves regenerative silence and returns transformed, with visible cost in the abandoned origami swan "slowly relaxing into oblivion." The accumulative structure builds through four folds leading to the obsidian refuge, though the return journey feels slightly rushed compared to the descent's careful pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Mara's acceptance of "ordinary magic" reweights her worldview with visible emotional cost ("her voice barely above a whisper"). The accumulative structure builds through music, eclipse, and the curl's transformation, though the final "promise of lifelong wonder" verges on thematic summary rather than earned image.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered discoveries (diaries, tapestry, symbols) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias shifts from collecting to acknowledging stories. The "displaced axis" concept effectively structures the narrative as a shift in attention rather than reality. Cost is legible in the recognition of humanity's collective indifference, though the magical realism of the unfurling dragons slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands with Elara's decision to continue the revolutionary work, shown through the planted fortune and its immediate effect on the dockworker. The causal chain from discovery to action to consequence is clear, though the cost remains somewhat abstract - we see change initiated but not what Elara sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the priest transforms the anchor from stillness to "dynamic equilibrium," with clear cost in the dimensions remaining "in flux." The accumulative/textural lens holds through layered loops building to critical mass. Deduction for late orientation—we don't understand "dimensional anchor" or "possession" mechanics until midpoint.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through layered memories, fortunes, and sensory details that culminate in Lirael creating her "symphony" as a Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is visible: she chooses memory architecture over commercial fortune-telling, accepting isolation in the spire. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara grounds herself after confronting timeline versions, with cost visible in "years" of disconnection. The hybrid lens holds but wavers mid-story when timeline mechanics become overly expository. The tablet's procedural generation of timelines feels mechanically convenient rather than causally earned.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure works—Lila's final understanding that "silence wasn't the absence of sound. It was the space where emotion could breathe" reweights the opening numbness with clear emotional cost shown through tears and teaching transformation. The accumulative structure coheres through sensory patterns. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, but the middle section's time jumps ("Days passed") create minor structural looseness.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Decisive Change from passive recorder to active witness, with visible cost (entering biohazard zone, risking exposure). Causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkage from message to investigation to commitment. The closure lands with Elias accepting his new role, though the cost could be more viscerally felt rather than implied.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds from cautious avoidance through risk-taking to acceptance, with the ultraviolet revealing as the decisive turn. The closure—breathing in city smells without flinching—demonstrates clear before/after with emotional cost paid through witnessed grief. The inherited memory device strains plausibility slightly but serves the accumulative design.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as the unraveled rope reveals "a single, unbroken thread—his own life" with clear cost in released memories of "failed poem, lost friend, road not taken." The accumulative lens holds as patterns and textures build toward the final spiral image, though the being's philosophical declarations occasionally dilute dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly as the bowl's meaning transforms from "holding silence" to "holding potential," with community participation providing visible cost through offered objects. The accumulative structure builds through layered sensory details toward this crystallized moment. Orientation anchors clearly by line three, and the textural lens holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through sensory detail and the client interaction providing a crystallized moment of choice. Closure achieves Charged Poise as Elias returns to his bench "ready for the next client and the next half truth," with cost implied through the "quiet satisfaction" that masks deeper isolation. However, the cost remains somewhat oblique rather than viscerally felt, and the piece lacks a decisive tightening that would elevate the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=5.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres but lacks true cost at closure - Clara's forged letter and subsequent "cycle" feel consequence-free. The mistaken address mechanism never fully explains why Clara's handwriting appears on a stranger's letter. While the pattern completes (letter begets compassion begets more letters), the final "Profit, Unseen" ledger entry substitutes metaphor for genuine price.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal chain holds and reaches a Decisive Change when Lira reveals herself as Veyra. However, the cost remains abstract - "a thread connecting two hearts" doesn't show what Kael sacrifices or risks. The closure lands but lacks the visible price required for higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lila gains new understanding of time/echoes with visible cost (tumbling, disorientation) and transforms her artistic practice. The accumulative build through canal observations → pendant activation → tunnel journey → transformed perception lands effectively. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (rooftop, canal system, illustrator).

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through mosaic/fractal imagery toward a resonant reconfiguration where Elara accepts loss as "alive, constantly reshaping." Cost is visible in tears and the choice to let memory flow rather than freeze. Slight deduction for extended reflection (brother's wisdom) that verges on 30% but remains anchored to present ritual and alters her stance.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear causal chain: tape discovery → sense memory → decoder search → message revelation → guardian transformation, with visible cost in Mara choosing visibility over safety. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost. Deduction for slight ambiguity in the tape's origin story and the convenient decoder discovery, though the emotional arc compensates.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Eleanor's stance shift from controlling to listening) with visible cost - she must abandon years of methodology. The accumulative lens holds as plant observations build toward reweighting her approach. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. Slight deduction for the somewhat explicit thematic articulation in dialogue near the end.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Marin's conceptual shift from extracting meaning to participating in ongoing conversation, with the brooch as catalyst and her transformed painting as proof. The accumulative lens holds through sensory layering ("salt-bleached cliffs," "skeletal remains," "black mirror") that builds toward this repricing, though the stranger's appearance introduces slight causal convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara accepts the unseen forces, with cost shown through the cave's destruction and reformation. The accumulative structure builds effectively through sensory details, though the pilgrim's nature remains unnecessarily opaque and the transformation sequence rushes slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds consistently through "staggered intervals" that build toward the trumpet's restoration as Resonant Reconfiguration. Each site visit adds a fragment that reweights the harbor's fractured history, with the final museum display carrying social/communal cost. However, the pattern feels mechanical—three sites, predictable discoveries—rather than organically pressured.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage: arrows appear → Elias follows → wall opens → confrontation leads to choice. The Decisive Change closure (accepting the blank ticket and new map) lands with conceptual cost—surrendering control of his meticulously mapped world. However, the woman's identity and the fortress's nature remain vague, weakening the cost's specificity. The orientation anchors (vault, clocktower) establish setting within the first 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Clara's skepticism "softened by wonder" represents a genuine stance shift with visible cost (her scientific worldview yielding to mystery). The accumulative structure coheres through whale songs, memories, and transcription building to this reconfiguration. Orientation anchors established cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as the escondite's shifting dimensions and amulet fragments build pressure toward the resonant reconfiguration of escape. The closure lands with felt cost ("For the first time in eons, Kael smiled") as both characters shatter their eternal loop. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Elara securing asylum papers (Decisive Change with visible cost), though the resolution feels somewhat convenient. Causality holds through the ink pot's abilities enabling her perception of agents' thoughts, leading to successful negotiation. The "wait actively" throughline connects opening teaching to final strategy. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two, but the fake body reveal and sudden negotiation success strain plausibility.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story lacks a decisive change or meaningful reconfiguration—Althea simply continues her routine of dawn writing sessions. No visible cost manifests from her actions; the ending declaration that she "persisted" offers continuity rather than closure. The Accumulative/Textural lens could apply but no density shift or pattern break reweights the dominant stake.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Charged Poise closure when Kael/Marcus stands at the container's edge with newfound identity and purpose—options crystallized, cost implied through the skeleton discovery. The hybrid lens holds adequately, though the shift from accumulative collecting to causal conspiracy-solving could be smoother. Who/where/when anchors establish clearly by line three.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing through Lira's realization that the riddle "wasn't meant to be decoded. It was meant to be felt," with visible cost in her abandoning her myth-busting identity. The Accumulative/Textural lens coheres as resonant details (shell, cello, observatory) build toward this reconfiguration. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay regarding the astronomer's relationship to the space.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as graffiti symbols layer into collective resistance, culminating in confrontation. The closure achieves Charged Poise—the Council withdraws but the threat persists, with cost visible in the "unwritten but possible" future. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words with Lira at the carnival's edge.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the archivist's discovery, reweighting Lira's act from solitary gesture to lasting truth. Cost is felt in "the summit felt colder, the silence deeper" and conceptually in humanity's replacement by drones. The accumulative structure coheres, though the time-jump to the archivist section slightly weakens immediate closure impact.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's successful repair validating her water-light method, with the ship's departure crystallizing her role. Cost is present but somewhat oblique - the "invisible mending" carries conceptual weight but lacks visceral stakes. The accumulative lens holds but the closure could use sharper definition of what's at risk beyond professional competence.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing: rivers reconceived as light-born from tectonic convergence rather than water sources, with Clara's worldview fundamentally altered ("Maps are lies. They erase the truth"). The accumulative lens holds through condensation patterns, the falcon's returns, and layered river imagery. Cost appears in Clara being "half-buried in snow" and her raw voice, though the final third rushes through years without deepening the immediate price of her discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost town transforms into a living chorus through accumulated rhythm. The seven-day progression from single footsteps to full revival follows clear accumulative logic. Cost is visible in Kael's patient waiting and the townsfolk's "gaunt, wary" state transforming to participation, though the mechanism of footsteps creating physical restoration stretches credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory detail (lavender/saltwater scent) triggers memory cascade that reweights understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara releases rather than harnesses. Cost is visible: the priests' terror/regret and Mara covering her ears from overwhelming voices. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words (underwater temple, diving suit, distress signal context).

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from physical journey to metaphysical acceptance. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias chooses writing over escaping, with felt cost in accepting his father's pride. The lattice-as-pen revelation provides the conceptual turn. However, the orientation remains somewhat unclear (what exactly is this lighthouse prison?) and the bodies mentioned lack causal connection to the main arc.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost dissolves into freedom after Elara's understanding breaks the curse, with visible cost in "centuries" of imprisonment. The accumulative/textural lens holds through fruit-messages building to awakening. Minor deduction for slightly rushed resolution that could have dwelt more on the cost of freedom.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure with the labyrinth's restoration as Resonant Reconfiguration—the "hymn" and "promise of what could be remade" reweight all prior weaving with visible cost (empty plates, raw fingers). The overlapping paths cohere into wholeness with clear before/after. Slight deduction for the sleepwalker thread not fully integrating into the closure mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong accumulative structure building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lirael's choice crystallizes ("She chose to follow"). The sundial's activation and villagers' gathering demonstrate visible communal cost and transformation. Slight deduction for the abstract nature of "the faith" as a thread rather than a more concrete dramatized choice, though the accumulative lens supports this approach.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira accepts her grandmother's legacy, transforming from decoder to teacher with the cost of confronting familial loss. The causal chain holds: chalk patterns → margin codes → fountain discovery → inheritance accepted. Who/where/when anchors clearly by ~50 words. The microchip revelation and hologram payoff earn their emotional weight through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when the flame reveals the chart's hidden message, reweighting Zara's work from decoration to rebellion. The accumulative build through stitching metaphors coheres. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the coup's actual threat stays vague, weakening the stakes' immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lirael's relationship to unspoken words transforms with visible emotional cost ("no longer heavy"). The accumulative structure coheres well through pattern-taught imagery. Deduction for slightly abstract middle section where the mechanism of how "the shard's light seeping into soil" enables message appearance remains unexplained, though this doesn't break the textural logic.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira's act crystallizes hope from fragments. Cost is visible in the "lotus-hearted ache" and the coral's sharp edges as metaphor for difficult peace. The closure lands with felt weight, though the general's receptiveness arrives somewhat easily.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as the orchard transforms from "lost" to "found" through communal rediscovery, with visible cost in years of isolation overcome. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases from solitary art-making to collective celebration, with the fresco fragment catalyzing pattern breaks. Who/where/when anchored early ("ruined orchard district," "Lira," "One morning"), and causality tracks from finding fragment to display to community resurrection.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sound waves gradually awakening the mural's memory, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marisol recognizes awakening as "not a destination, but a rhythm." The nested awakening structure (mural→memory→grandfather→artist) creates coherent escalation with visible cost in accepting perpetual curiosity over certainty. Orientation anchors (garden, Marisol, task) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing garden transforms from covert message to public beacon, with cost implied through exposure risk ("news outlets buzzed"). The causal chain from greenhouse test to garden activation holds, though the transition between scenes could be tighter. Orientation anchors (greenhouse, Elias, present-day) establish clearly within opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lira's final song represents earned transformation from centuries of isolation to connection. The tree's growth from the postcard's seed creates accumulative pressure, and her shift from insomnia to sleep marks decisive change with clear cost—releasing control of her work. The accumulative lens holds consistently throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lirael's repair transforms the chime into "a conduit for a sound no one had heard in centuries," with clear cost—the original sound is forever altered. The accumulative lens holds as density builds from glass-orchids to extinct feelings to the final "nameless emotion, half-formed and trembling" that rises, reweighting preservation itself.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal structure with clear closure - Elara's linguistic breakthrough enables her emotional breakthrough, leading to the phone call that reopens communication. The cost is visible: years of silence that created a "chasm" with her sister. The manuscript about two sisters provides elegant structural mirroring. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient appearance of Henrik's perfectly-suited manuscript at the exact right moment.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as encrypted fear transforms to "open-hearted truth," but the cost remains abstract ("a sender waited, their heart a little lighter"). The accumulative structure coheres through recurring imagery (breathing amphitheater, chain links, adhesive patterns). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, though the actual stakes of the decryption arrive late.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure lands with Elias walking toward Dr. Voss, transforming from courier to son - a Decisive Change with emotional cost ("the echo of lost songs humming in his veins"). However, the accumulative build relies heavily on backstory exposition rather than present-scene pressure, and the dream sequence introducing the dust-mote map feels unearned by prior causality.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's shift from searching to creating her own codes, with visible cost in abandoning the terrace and accepting separation. The accumulative structure coheres well as patterns (grain, codes, thresholds) build toward the final recognition that "distance is a kind of prayer," though the father's sudden appearance strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the shared experience of the alignment, with felt cost in the isolation these researchers endure. The accumulative lens holds as patterns build toward the luminous respite moment. However, the cost remains primarily atmospheric rather than decisively dramatized through choice or sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through crater glass, seeds, and emotional transliteration toward a Conceptual Repricing ending. The closure lands with Lira's realization that "paths disappeared not because they were forgotten, but because they were *released*," which reweights the premise. However, the cost remains abstract—we see the truth but don't feel what Lira loses or sacrifices in accepting it, violating the cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as Lira's music gradually guides the crowd toward the fountain, with the final communal moment serving as Resonant Reconfiguration. The cost is present but understated—the arcade's mechanical patterns break at a price (the clown stops, routines disrupted). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=5.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lirael's successful verse-writing that temporarily breaks the nostalgia ban, but the cost remains oblique—"staggered" and "unsteady legs" don't fully convey what she's sacrificed. The accumulative texture builds effectively through dance, dust application, and verse-writing, yet the "elective exile" ending feels unearned without showing what she's actually choosing between.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's crystallized understanding that "illumination was not about grand revelations, but about the quiet moments," with the prism atrium serving as both literal and metaphorical lens. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward this reweighting of perspective. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than felt—no path is foreclosed, no opportunity lost, just a gentle affirmation of existing beliefs.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elias shifts from haunted to "enlightened" with the emotional cost of confronting his mother's message. The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and sensory details build toward the final acceptance. Deducted for the cost being more felt than dramatically visible in action, though the "I hear you" moment and forest's sigh create resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through thread-weaving and trial balloons that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration—the grotto revealing itself as a crossroads between timelines. Cost is visible in the silver thread from her own hair and the emotional weight of seeing failed versions of herself. Deduction for slightly abstract handling of the parallel timeline concept that could be more viscerally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through diary discoveries leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira becomes "the map." The closure lands with felt cost as she burns the film negative and accepts the legacy's burden. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in opening lines. The locket discovery provides meaningful deepening that reweights her grandmother's role.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when the mirrors show possibilities and "somewhere, in a meadow of golden light, a woman with Lirael's eyes smiled" - transforming grief into connection. The borrowed heartbeat drives the entire ritual, and the cost (exhaustion, emotional weight) is embodied. The accumulative structure coheres as sound, memory, and reflection build toward this crystallized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the negotiations building toward treaty signing as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the delegates' "shaking hands, their faces a mix of relief and regret" marks visible cost. The clipboard's scars accumulate meaning ("coffee stain from a sleepless night in a bunker, a crease where a general had slammed it") that charges the final image. However, the actual negotiation content remains abstract, weakening the specificity of the closure's cost.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—the egg's dissolution creating a "ghost in the machine of progress." The ritual of placing the egg and pouring water creates visible cost through futility itself. The closure lands with "Some truths were better left cracked" reweighting the entire gesture. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (who/where anchors could be clearer in opening).

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the dance sequence toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when echoes are freed. Closure lands with Lirael carrying "a symphony of resistance," showing visible transformation. The cost is felt through her physical exertion and the weight of defying conformity, though the conceptual stakes could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Elias's puppet show serving as both literal performance and metaphorical exploration of truth-telling, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where he finds his method through "half-lit epiphanies." The closure lands with conceptual cost—accepting that "half-truths are the only kind worth telling"—though the cost could be more viscerally felt. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established within the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lirael finds peace through her ritual. The cost—emotional labor and physical ache from the meticulous work—is present but mild. The piece teaches its pattern of ephemeral memorial-making and pays it off when the monarch validates her gesture, though the transformation lacks decisive stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building toward the rope's illumination and Lira's materialization—a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (raw hands, lost voice). Causality holds as Kael's discovery of the punched card leads to the rope ritual. The cost is legible but could be more viscerally felt; the ending image of burning names provides closure but feels slightly rushed.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through storm/decay/renewal motifs. Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Mara becomes "architect" of the directive rather than follower, with cost implied through "decaying directive" transformation. However, the hologram sequence introduces new information without clear causal linkage to prior beats, and the cost remains more conceptual than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear causal chain from tile discovery through chamber revelation to covenant acceptance, with Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Elara transforms from seeking external answers to internal dialogue. Cost is visible in accepting limitations of empirical knowledge ("The covenant wasn't with the unknown, but with herself"). Orientation anchors established early, though the voice's nature remains deliberately ambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based healing sessions, but closure lacks decisive cost—Lirael notes "that was enough" without showing what she sacrificed or how she changed. The sanctuary setting and broken pin establish clear anchors early. The "reality shifts" time constraint is mentioned but never creates actual pressure or deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias discovers the sextant now points inward, crystallizing the theme that boundaries are navigated, not erased. The accumulative build through glass-making, synchronized breathing, and mirror-hanging creates coherent pressure. Cost is felt in the transformation of both instrument and understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when mending the quartz eye triggers the orchard's bloom, suggesting renewal after abandonment. However, the causal mechanism linking the mending to the transformation is unclear, and the cost remains more conceptual than felt. The orientation is clean, and the accumulative structure builds coherently toward the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure (Elara choosing to inherit through the cameo fusion) lands with clear cost—forsaking the museum's approval for forbidden knowledge. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic objects build toward the final crystallization, though the library vision feels slightly disconnected from the main causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.8)
    Causal linkage holds throughout (diary→cipher→negotiation→access), and closure occurs on-page with Elara gaining library entry. However, the cost remains abstract - "embracing the unknown" lacks concrete sacrifice. The orientation is clear early, and the because/therefore chain functions, but the final "willingness to embrace the unknown" feels unearned without visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught progression through narrative threads, emerald card, and name-flowers building to Resonant Reconfiguration. The garden's transformation from myth to choice ("The garden isn't a place—it's a choice") lands with felt cost as the ship vanishes. Orientation anchors established early (abandoned carnival ship, foggy bay, chimera twins).

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage: discovery leads to investigation, pattern recognition enables solution, solution reveals new role. The closure (Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara becomes a "weaver of timelines") lands with conceptual cost—she's no longer just preserving history but actively managing fractured realities. Minor weakness: the return to the mechanism room feels convenient rather than earned through struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building through sensory layers (sound-as-light, frost ridges, spiral patterns) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the mapkeeper finds "quiet within" noise rather than silencing it. The bloom materializes through accumulated pressure and the caves achieve a "duet of hush and hum" with visible cost ("ribs no longer aching" implies prior pain). Orientation anchors clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where rekindling the beacon transforms from literal ship-guidance to metaphorical hope-sustaining, with visible cost in Elara's bleeding hands and years of solitary work. The accumulative lens holds as density builds from shard-handling through alignment attempts to final communal gathering, though the seventh-night breakthrough feels slightly convenient despite prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: Lirael shifts from archiving others' experiences to sculpting her own identity from lived memory. The cost is subtly present in letting go of her role as detached observer ("The archive would wait"). The accumulative structure coheres through the fog's solidification triggering deeper engagement with the forecourt's collective memory, though the middle section could tighten its causal linkage between shadow measurement and personal revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through fire-lily imagery that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira transforms from guilt-ridden to purposeful. The closure lands with felt cost ("becoming fire") though the conceptual price could be more concrete. Who/where/when anchors clearly by line 2.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise - the final moment crystallizes Elara and Kael's options with the pause "doing its work." The accumulative lens holds as patterns of tide/transition/metamorphosis build toward this reconfiguration. Cost is implied through the "years underground" metaphor and the relationship's transformation, though it could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: the sprout transforms loss into growth, with the doll's sacrifice enabling new life. The hybrid structure holds—accumulative collection of silences builds to causal change when the doll is lost. Cost is visible in mourning "for days" and the permanent loss of her anchor. The "planted something new" insight reweights prior material effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.1)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Elara reframes silence from absence to presence, with implicit cost in her weeks of misdirected effort. However, the revelation lacks visible struggle on the page—the storm glass simply stills and she immediately understands, missing the friction that would elevate this realization.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkages (ruby pulse → waterfall entry → mural discovery → stairway reveal), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira recognizes herself as the awaited queen. Closure lands with conceptual cost ("The throne was never unclaimed. It waited for the one who'd see herself in the past"), though the physical/emotional price could be more visceral. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's shift from isolation to reconnection, with visible cost in risking the sanctuary's balance. The accumulative/textural lens holds as imagery and atmosphere build toward her recognition that "some bridges were meant to be rebuilt." Orientation anchors clearly by line three. The closure lands with felt cost, though the mechanics of "holding thresholds" remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's act of turning the bolt, which dissolves the crystallized pressure and transforms both the farm and her relationship to resilience. The cost is legible in the dissolved diamonds and the risk she takes ("We die"), though the final insight about translating pressure feels slightly abstract rather than fully embodied.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change when Lirael discovers her family chose to end their dynasty to protect others, transforming her understanding from tragedy to sacrifice. The causal chain from gramophone to standing waves to hidden letters is clear, with visible cost in her tears and the weight of choosing transparency over power. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence where each vision conveniently provides exactly the needed information.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as pattern-based discovery leads to resonant reconfiguration with the greenhouse dissolving and Cedric transformed. Closure lands with visible cost (greenhouse ruins, armor dissolved, identity reconfigured), though some causal linkages between string-cutting and reality shifts could be tighter. The "patterns" throughline effectively constrains tactics from program discovery through final dissolution.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered discoveries (button, dust patterns, date inscription). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias creates the new folder, accepting partial knowledge as sufficient—a stance shift with conceptual cost. However, the middle lacks a decisive tightening moment where accumulated details force a choice, weakening escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkages from infiltration to evidence theft to distribution. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Mara hands off the drive, foreclosing her safety with visible cost (relay station destroyed, drones hunting). The "line has held" reprises the motivation with earned weight, though the explosion's convenience slightly softens the cost.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the saxophone's intensifying wail drowning out the prophecy's words. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—Elias successfully hushing the prophecy "at least for now" with visible physical cost and the implicit threat of return. The orientation anchors (grotto, morning, Elias) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (monuments, falling leaves, moonstone trail) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elinor accepts her role as decoder. The closure lands with implied cost (accepting responsibility for warnings/seeking Lirael) and the "emerged transformed always" motif pays off. Orientation anchors who/where/when effectively by ~100 words. Minor deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear causal chain from journal discovery through physical quest to philosophical realization, with the compass serving as both literal goal and conceptual catalyst. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias accepts uncertainty as creative principle, visible in his clockwork flower garden. The orientation anchors cleanly (tinkerer, cave, searching for compass), and the Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the final reweighting of his worldview.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the closure landing as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira's spectral appearance reweights Kael's understanding of loss and acceptance. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral; "his hand closed on empty air" gestures at loss but doesn't fully embody the price of this revelation. The orientation is clear early (foundry, after search party, Kael with coin).

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with proper closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira's understanding of healing transforms from seeking laughter to embracing the journey itself. The crocodile's tooth shifts from veil-piercing tool to "symbol of resilience," with visible cost in acknowledging truth's bite. Orientation anchors solidly by ~100 words, though the spectral encounter could tighten causally.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elias's realization that mercy is "not a solution, but a question" with visible cost in his acceptance of ongoing struggle. The accumulative structure coheres through UV motifs and trauma echoes, though the woman's sudden appearance strains causality slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure achieves Conceptual Repricing through the fragment's reclamation reweighting history's overlooked threads. The accumulative lens holds as sensory details (ink taste, constellation cracks) build toward the final insight about anchoring in the eternal instant. Cost is legible in "a world that drowned itself in fear" being given second chances.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias discovers the hidden truth and the ghosts dissolve, with emotional cost visible in "his chest tight with the weightless burden." The accumulative/textural lens holds as dust patterns and physical details build toward revelation. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines. The discovery-to-understanding arc follows causal logic, though the ghosts' sudden ability to fade after acknowledgment feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the library's transformation from "perfect order" to creative "maelstrom," with clear cost in the destruction of the old system. The Accumulative/Textural lens dominates as frost patterns, whisper vibrations, and press rhythms build density toward the rupture. The closure lands with visible transformation where "patrons, no longer seekers but architects, began to rebuild."

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with the mirror-covering accumulating toward fungal revelation that reweights the Luminari myth. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through "planted a seed of doubt, a fungus of revolution" with visible cost in Kael's transformation from revolutionary to archaeologist. The vase shard's evolution from destruction to promise anchors the reconfiguration effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the resonance chamber amplifying truth-telling as the central mechanism. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira's admission restores the music box, with visible cost in her confronting painful truth. The covenant's philosophy drives causality effectively, though the transformation mechanics ("tethering") could be more precisely dramatized rather than explained.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with petrichor samples building toward the lagoon's ancient sentience, culminating in Lira's acceptance of unknowability as she labels her final jars—a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (the expedition's fate). The compass's progression from discovery to guide to "talisman" creates coherent pressure, though the expedition's disappearance explanation feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the archway portal creating a resonant reconfiguration, but the closure lacks visible cost—Lira gains knowledge and purpose without losing anything tangible. The temporal mechanics (grandmother across centuries) strain causality without clear rules.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well as Mara decodes the window's layers across seasons, building to the resonant reconfiguration of understanding flowers' nocturnal blooming. The closure lands conceptually but the cost remains more intellectual than felt - "Mara smiled" suggests satisfaction without visible sacrifice or foreclosed paths.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands with Mara destroying the codex and antagonist together ("just bought time"), creating a Decisive Change with visible cost. The causal chain from diary discovery through lagoon visions to tunnel confrontation holds, but the Historical Preservation Society reveal feels abrupt without sufficient groundwork.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the cove's revival via collective memory, with the amber bottle serving as a focusing lens. The cost—that this is reimagining rather than resurrection—lands clearly in "not from stone and mortar, but from memory and will." The accumulative lens holds as details build toward the transformation, though the middle section's cataloging of artifacts slightly weakens causality.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition driving toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Voss reframes the prophecy from disaster to awakening. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("not to stop the storm, but to listen"), though the emotional price could be more visceral. Causality holds as the phonograph pattern matches the foghorn's silence, creating coherent pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lirael successfully reopens the path and discovers "the texture of borrowed time" - gritty yet smooth. The cost is visible: she must navigate the vortex's dangerous pull ("like diving into a frozen lake") and offer seeds/memory/breath. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration: Lira shifts from passive observer to active "maestro" who can influence storms through bell harmonics, with visible cost in her aching arms and the risk of disrupting natural balance. The piece anchors who/where/when immediately and maintains causality through the bell-testing sequence. The closure lands but relies on Veyra's validation rather than pure dramatization, and the "conductor/maestro" metaphor feels slightly imposed.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the stardust preserved in glass—a physical proof that transforms both characters' understanding of worth. The accumulative structure builds from stillness-tending through star-tracking to the crater journey, with cost visible in Zara's decades of marginalization. However, Veyra's sudden softening lacks sufficient groundwork, and the thematic echo "I just listened" edges toward explicit moralizing (-0.4).

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.4)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern accumulation (ghosts, glass visions, shattered release) building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where speaking releases both ghosts and burden. Cost is visible in the decades of silence broken and the physical shattering of the artifact. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation sequence that could be more causally grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from numerical to textural time-keeping, with clear cost (leaving the urn fragment behind). The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through catalogued objects becoming characters in their own story. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3, and the capsule discovery provides meaningful tightening. Deduction for occasional causality softness—the urn fragment's "suddenly" inscription triggering mercury stillness lacks prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through gathering fragments and weaving. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira accepts impermanence ("the act of creation mattered more than its permanence"), but the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear closure through Resonant Reconfiguration—Lira's death becomes the orchard's eternal heartbeat, with visible cost in her final breath. The copper-wire network successfully bridges human and spirit realms. Minor deduction for slightly delayed orientation of the central conflict's stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.2)
    Resonant Reconfiguration achieved through Lirael's chest-ache of "familiar longing" and breaking-glass laugh—a Charged Poise where understanding crystallizes. The amber-as-catalyst provides causal linkage while the accumulative sculpture path builds texture. Cost reads as the unraveling of her protective skepticism, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "The battlefield was becoming a garden" crystallizes the transformation with clear cost (the reef's death, years of patient work ahead). The accumulative structure coheres through bird language, seed-planting, and memory. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay (coachman's identity emerges gradually) but this serves the textural approach.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres as each riddle builds toward the final "love" answer, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration where the settlement transforms from isolated to connected. The cost—shifting from valuable distance-stories to shared closeness—is conceptually present but not viscerally felt on the page, lacking a specific sacrifice or loss at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elio's shift from passive exile to active exploration, with the compass rose physically warming as proof of his changed stance. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and temporal distortions build toward his final movement through the golden door. The cost is visible in his abandonment of the observation deck's safety for an uncertain path. Minor causality wobble: the grandmother's apparition appears without clear trigger beyond the anniversary timing.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal drive with clear closure: Kael successfully amends the magical imbalance through the chess piece swap, with visible cost in the risk and tension. The "sound of silence" payoff and sky clearing provide decisive change with resonant reconfiguration. Minor deduction for slightly convenient timing and the somewhat abstract nature of the "imbalance" threat.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's recognition that she embodies all the missing pieces, with visible cost in her "scars aching faintly" and the foreclosed path of hiding. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as her repetitive walking accumulates meaning until the board reconfigures, though the transition from walking to board movement could trace more clearly.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lirael accepts bearing others' memories as her truth, with visible cost in the obsidian shards embedding in her skin. The accumulative structure coheres well, building from avoidance through mother's revelation to acceptance, though the cavern sequence briefly strains spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Alaric's self-forgiveness literally unfreezes the village, with cost visible in accepting his failure as permanent. The accumulative structure builds through thread colors, memory, and the woven hush metaphor cohering at the labyrinth's center. Orientation is clear early (exiled tutor, frozen village, labyrinth).

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through escalating imagery (bone towers glowing with colors) to a Resonant Reconfiguration where light literally refracts truth. The closure lands with visible cost—Kael knows he'll be called a heretic tomorrow. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the ritual deadline creates genuine pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates as Accumulative/Textural, building through layered memories and the charm-statue interaction toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira accepts brokenness as strength. The closure lands with felt cost ("letting the fumes burn her lungs") and conceptual repricing of the charm as promise rather than key. Minor orientation delays and some causality softness in the middle prevent higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias finding peace with impermanence in the cavern. The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this crystallization. Cost is visible in his decades of burden lifting. Orientation is clear early, though the mother's apparition strains causality without proper setup.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Elara's whispered intent reaches the village fisherman and his wife who "felt it—a warmth in the air, a pressure behind their eyes." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details (scent, vibration, light) build toward this payoff. Cost is felt through tears mixing with rain, though the ease of success slightly diminishes tension.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as the reverse migration succeeds—lost routes return through the antenna's signal, transforming absence into presence with clear emotional cost (tears, trembling). The accumulative structure coheres through the moon's phases, midnight calls, and building sequences. Minor deduction for some causality softness around how exactly the censer foot's weight fluctuations enable navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise - Mara crystallizes her stance that "safety isn't just a feeling—it's a choice" with the ledger creating undeniable pressure. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the causal chain from truffle foraging to confronting corruption feels somewhat disconnected despite the empathy virus worldbuilding.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens holds: boutonnière leads to dock meeting, reveals memory theft, culminates in Elias's decision to return memories. Closure achieves Decisive Change with visible cost ("I've carried enough"). Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of returning memories—the mechanism isn't dramatized, only promised.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lila's transformed relationship to being lost/found, with visible cost in confronting buried memories. The causal chain from map to cavern to vision holds, though the vision's mechanics feel slightly convenient. The "empirically intuitive" payoff and doorway metaphor land with earned weight.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a clear causal drive (dreams → warning → climb → revelation) with an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration when the queen understands her bleeding mirrors the starlight's. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—she "understands" but we don't see what this understanding will cost her beyond the abstract notion of confronting fear.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout with pattern breaks and density increases building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's shifted perspective enables success. The closure lands with visible transformation—the nexus stabilizes, warmth returns—and conceptual cost in abandoning her forcing approach. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical revelation trigger through Jorin's ledger.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through grave discovery, scroll finding, and cave revelation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where the narrator reframes nostalgia from curse to compass. Orientation anchors (Elias Voss, mountain ranger cabin, grave with date) arrive within the first paragraph. The cost is primarily conceptual—understanding he's "building" the past rather than escaping it—though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt on the page rather than stated.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's discovery of the engraving and connection to Eleanor, reweighting the screw from tool to talisman of redemption. The accumulative pattern holds—each detail (engraving, photo, file) deepens understanding. Cost is visible in Mrs. Voss's "trembling hands" and "avoidance of eye contact," though the final paragraph's thematic summary ("threads in a tapestry of resilience") dilutes impact.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.9)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration where scars literally transform into a new language, with clear cost (fear, risk of soul-cutting shards). The accumulative structure builds through ritual elements toward this crystallization. Slight opacity around the exact mechanics of rune-casting weakens causality but doesn't break the textural logic.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Elias's reconnection with Lila's resonance, completing the unfinished song. The causal chain from perfume bottle to induced current to musical reconnection holds logically within the story's magical realism. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract - we see the chainsaws start but don't feel what Elias sacrifices or how he's changed beyond resolution of guilt.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the Witness's wandering through the library building toward a philosophical realization. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing when the Witness accepts that "some mysteries were meant to be lived, not solved," but the cost remains abstract—we see peace but not what was sacrificed. The orientation anchors (ancient temple library, the Witness) establish early, yet causality feels loose with convenient reality-shifts like the mural figures stepping out without clear rules.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure coheres well, building from mundane clock-tending through the counting ritual to the fjord revelation. The Conceptual Repricing closure ("clocks measure longing") lands with philosophical weight, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal progression from detection specialist analyzing barriers to discovering they're emotional constructs to transforming them through surrender. The closure lands with Kael's decision to stay, showing decisive change with visible cost (abandoning his previous approach). The "physics of letting go" concept pays off through concrete action when Kael adjusts the laser frequency to match trust rather than aggression.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Clara gathering cryptic clues that lead to the underground subway car revelation. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise—Clara's understanding shifts from seeking external contradictions to recognizing them as mirrors, with the emotional cost of confronting her father visible in "tears mixing with rain." The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, and the magical realism elements are taught early through the library's "shifting floors."

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) when Mara smiles and traces the disc's cracks, accepting her role with visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres through the glass harmonica's intensifying melody, though the cost could be more visceral in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara realizes the covenant's weight exists in present acts of preservation. The accumulative structure coheres through returning images (locket, ink, flowers). However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral - we understand but don't fully feel what Elara sacrifices or risks in this moment of understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through the conductor's reframing of loneliness as "a language" and Elias's chest no longer aching, showing felt cost. The accumulative progression from rumor to ritual to revelation coheres, though the mechanics of the "cure" remain somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building through layered sensory details toward the stillpoint discovery. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias finds "the place where feeling becomes seeing" with his mother. Minor deduction because the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt - the journey's difficulty is stated but not fully dramatized in the final beats.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias transforms from history editor to witness/guide with visible cost (the girl's fever, his guilt). The web metaphor accumulates meaningfully through projection scenes and Lira's teaching, culminating in "editing history wasn't about erasing mistakes. It was about turning them into seeds." Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words, and the accumulative texture builds toward genuine stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where individual silence becomes collective music, with visible communal transformation as cost/reward. The accumulative structure coheres well through the pattern of silence-to-music translation. Orientation anchors (harbor, night, Kael) land clearly by ~100 words. The closure effect - the town discovering silence's musical potential - lands with emotional resonance, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara discovers her grandmother was Elara and accepts her role as "gardener." The accumulative structure builds through artistic interventions to this revelation with clear emotional cost. The transformation from "arsonist" to "gardener" provides the required before/after with felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with sensory density building toward the drumming scene. However, closure lacks visible cost—the ending promises transformation without showing what Eli sacrifices or risks. The POV shift midway breaks causality, and the resolution ("finally found my rhythm") feels unearned without demonstrating what finding this rhythm costs him.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the labyrinth as sentient observer, building through map discoveries to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias understands the maze's consciousness. The closure lands with him choosing whispers over shouts, but the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see changed tactics but not what Elias sacrifices. The chamber discovery provides the key turn, yet the ease of finding the staircase undercuts earned struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story presents a Resonant Reconfiguration through accumulated light-weaving that "softens" the canal's tension, but the cost remains abstract ("the darkness a little less heavy"). The accumulative structure coheres, yet lacks a decisive moment where Lira must choose between competing values or pay a visible price for her vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Lila shifts from isolation to collaboration ("Then let's keep planting"). The cost is visible in her seven losses and the emotional weight of her father's abandonment being reframed. The accumulative texture builds through chess games, window displays, and the grotto's magnetic resonance to create meaningful change.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira releases the scrimshaw and accepts the island's dissolution, with visible cost in "laughing through her tears." The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward the whale encounter, though the causal link between releasing the scrimshaw and personal transformation needs stronger grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.4)
    Story operates under Accumulative/Textural lens with clear Earned Stasis closure—Lirael's commitment to "carve another" tomorrow crystallizes her resistance through endurance. The happiness mandate establishes stakes early, and the whittling ritual accumulates meaning through repetition and philosophical layering, though the final whispered line edges toward explicit thematic statement rather than pure image.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=5.2)
    Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with density increase toward dissolution of boundaries. However, closure lacks visible cost—Lirael reshapes reality without price, making the transformation feel unearned. The "tremor of certainty" repetition provides structure but the final step "into the unknown" doesn't reconfigure stakes with legible consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Hybrid lens (primarily Accumulative/Textural with Causal elements) and achieves closure through Elias's acceptance of seeing differently, with visible cost in his transformed art. The magical revelation about plants communicating and Marla's phoenix backstory strains causality—these major rule changes arrive late without adequate setup, though the final image of Elias painting with new understanding lands with resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira discovers that connection isn't engineered but already present in the mountain's song, with the scratched lens encoding this ancient voice. The accumulative structure builds through lab→cave→discovery→return, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we understand the paradigm shift but don't feel what Lira sacrifices or risks.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's shift from isolated grief to creating a "language" for collective healing, with visible cost in his bleeding fingers and emotional exhaustion. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details layer (stencil→lanterns→origami→shadows) to reweight grief as transformative rather than destructive. However, the causality between discovering the stencil and inventing the ritual feels underdeveloped, and the final inscription appearing in his wife's handwriting breaks established reality without proper setup.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based closure landing through Elara's teaching moment and Mara's conversion. The final image of "somewhere in the overlap, a new culture would take root" provides Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (rebuilding after financial collapse). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The closure effect lands but the transformation from skepticism to belief needs stronger intermediate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward Lirael's acceptance of the "atoms of nostalgia." The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as she shifts from avoiding patterns to embracing possibility, with the cost being abandonment of her protective methodology. However, the middle section relies heavily on dialogue-as-exposition about the archive's dangers, and Kael's convenient disappearance undermines causality at the crucial transformation moment.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration - the shadow transforms into golden motes that reshape the library's books, with visible cost in the metamorphosis of hope itself. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the concept of "hope losing its shape" remains somewhat abstract despite the concrete imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through the reconstruction process paralleling Lira's internal rebuilding. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as she reframes compassion from liability to "reason to keep going," with cost visible in the shed layers and isolation. The con revelation provides clear before/after stakes, though some backstory edges toward summary rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure through coffee-ring portals coheres, building to Mara's acceptance of scars as bridges. However, the resolution feels unearned—she simply touches the hourglass and receives enlightenment. The cost (carrying scars with pride) is declared rather than demonstrated through difficult choice.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara commits to uncovering the Alhambra's secrets, with visible emotional cost ("tears pricking her eyes"). The accumulative structure coheres well through psychometric revelations that deepen understanding. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) established clearly by ~120 words. Minor deduction for the cost being more felt than dramatically paid.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from aurora-lit archway through holographic revelation to the chamber of preserved creativity, with clear cost when Kael absorbs the stardust ("sank to his knees"). The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as his creative block dissolves into "ideas, each one a star waiting to fall," though the transformation's speed slightly undermines the earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens dominates with density increase toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael's first dream transforms the dune. Cost is visible in the erupting sand and sprouting flames. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The wave function concept strains causality but the pattern teaches itself through repetition.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the forest's hum builds through ironwoods' minor keys, copperwillows' trills, and brassbark oaks' bass notes until they form the chord that unlocks transformation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara plants the gear-seed, accepting loss (empty pocket, fading father) to preserve wildness. The cost is felt in "her pocket empty but her mind full."

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the ridgeway journey building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Jorin understands courage as repeated choice. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("the lesson sinking in") and the cyclical return to waiting for "the next leash to break." Causality holds through the teaching journey structure, though the "leash breaking" metaphor remains somewhat opaque and could use clearer grounding earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elric's choice to speak, with visible cost in breaking the fortress's foundational pact. The causal chain from neglected bolt to Lady Veyra's scream to Elric's revelation works cleanly. Deduction for the somewhat convenient yellow stain epiphany that feels slightly forced as a turning mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story delivers a clear Decisive Change when the pretender's illusion is sundered and Veyra reclaims her heritage, with visible cost in the "graceful collapse" and courtiers' recognition. The causal chain holds: messages guide Veyra → she interprets the celestial timing → uses the ink pellet → unmasks the pretender. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph. Cost is present but could be more viscerally felt beyond the symbolic collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the tapping rhythm and coral bleaching building toward revelation, but the closure—sailing into a mystical realm—shifts to magical realism without adequate groundwork. The cost (abandoning the station) exists but feels unearned because the transformation from scientific monitoring to supernatural gateway-crossing lacks causal bridges.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration closure lands effectively—the rebellion transforms from "embers" to "a storm, gathering" through Lira's activation of the stones. The accumulative build from silence to collective roar provides clear before/after with felt cost. Minor orientation lag in the opening slightly weakens early causality.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from kite discovery through vault opening to embryo planting, with a Decisive Change closure that transforms the hot springs and implies broader societal change. The cost is visible - Nana chooses to plant rather than control the embryo, foreclosing the regime's path. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of the reconstruction crews being absent.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through somatic markers building toward Lila's Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. The cost is visible in her acceptance that "Elias was gone, but the love they'd shared wasn't erased." Opening orientation is clear (arboretum, cliff, morning ritual), and the closure lands with her walking home "the pearl of stillness cradled in her chest."

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias reweaves fragmentation into creative possibility, with visible cost in his abandoned portraits and the lighthouse's decay. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring motifs (threads, tarot, portraits) that reweight at closure. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words, though the metaphorical "walls closing in" briefly obscures whether pressure is literal or psychological.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise as Lira crosses the threshold into the Tower of Hours, crystallizing her quest with visible stakes. The accumulative lens holds through wind-sculpted patterns, ephemeral ink designs, and time fragments. Deduction for slight causality softness in how the ink patterns directly reveal the tower location - the mechanism feels convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.4)
    Clear causal chain from letter discovery to revolutionary action with a Decisive Change closure (awakening both Kael and revolution). The cost is visible - Lirael abandons her role's neutrality and faces certain Council retribution. However, the rapid escalation from archival duty to active rebellion feels mechanically compressed, and Kael's century-old radical ideas conveniently align with current needs without adaptation.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's acceptance of the farm as "manifesto" and "revolution," with visible cost in her calloused hands and the weight of continuing alone. The accumulative structure coheres well—each return to the sandbag, roses, and dome deepens meaning—though the father's backstory section (paragraph 3) slightly disrupts present-moment momentum without a strong enough return anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where the goddess dissolves into the garden, stabilizing the constellations at clear cost. The rail spike as conductor, the frequency translations, and the final pure tone create coherent causality, though the cost could be more viscerally felt in Kael's body.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Decisive Change—Clara exposes corruption and transforms from passive heiress to active reformer, with visible costs (family relationships, public criticism). The causal chain from discovery to action is clear. However, the temporal scope strains credibility (observatory scene to Congressional testimony), and the ending's metaphorical declaration weakens the otherwise concrete cost.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira's forgiveness rewrites the firmware, dissolving guilt into understanding with clear emotional cost. The causal chain from amber discovery to firmware entry to resolution holds. However, the mechanics of "entering firmware's memory" strain credibility without sufficient grounding, and the revelation that Dr. Althea Voss is Lira's mother feels convenient rather than inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where individual silence becomes collective message, with visible cost in Mara's transformation from observer to participant. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern recognition (tile→mandala→mosaic→language). Minor deduction for slightly abstract final realization that could use more embodied grounding in the last paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias's symbolic act of placing the tessera, with visible cost in the destroyed city and implied emotional weight. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and retrocognitive episodes build toward the final image of promise. However, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we see aftermath but not the price Elias personally pays for his stance, weakening the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-taught synesthesia and echo-weaving that builds to a Resonant Reconfiguration where fractured timelines mend through collective dance. The tarot coin's transformation from Fool to Wheel to blank surface tracks the progression cleanly. Cost is visible in the erasure of the Fool's journey and Elias's fading at dawn, though the mechanism of timeline repair through dance feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias's discovery of the geode-neural alignment creates a new path forward, with clear cost (the pain of the shock, rejection of easier corporate solutions). The accumulative lens holds as details layer toward this crystallization. However, the cost could be more visceral—"laughing through tears" gestures at emotion without fully embodying it, and the resolution feels slightly neat for the complexity introduced.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Lira becomes "translator" and "voice" with visible transformation (spores merging with her body). The accumulative lens holds as sensory details build toward this reconfiguration. Cost is present but somewhat abstract - the fossil's dissolution and her physical change carry weight, though the stakes of "awakening the world's memory" remain conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands cleanly: Mara shifts from seeking fixed prophecy to understanding futures as "fields to be planted," with the echo's release as visible cost. The accumulative structure coheres through button-sorting as metaphor for unscrambling truth, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and symbolic details (pillbox, codes, mist) layer toward Mara's stance crystallization about courage being rekindled rather than unearthed. Closure lands as Charged Poise with felt cost ("her steps lighter, her resolve steadier"), though the final paragraph's explicit thematic statement ("The bluff had given her a gift: not the truth, but the courage to seek it") weakens the resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story achieves Earned Stasis (Thaddeus continues his role) but lacks visible cost—the "palimpsest promise" remains abstract without testing his commitment. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural but accumulation doesn't build toward pressure or reweight the stakes. Orientation is clear but the absence of meaningful escalation or cost at closure limits the score.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Mara carries the oasis's lesson forward, with cost visible in the fractured timelines she witnesses. The accumulative lens holds as patterns build through sun-following, lantern response, and sunflower discovery. Deduction for cost being more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase toward Mara accepting light, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration when she "let the light in." The cost is visible in her years of darkness and Elias's persistent efforts. However, the closure's emotional weight relies heavily on telling ("for the first time in years") rather than embodied demonstration, and the final line about the waiting rosebush feels detached from the immediate scene.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Lirael shifts from coexistence to pioneering, with visible cost in releasing her connection to her species' collective. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through the sundial's revelations and library transformations. However, the causality between touching the sundial and the library's physical changes lacks clear mechanics, and the cost of independence could be more viscerally felt rather than conceptually stated.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lila's journey toward connection building through the spiral, Elara's guidance, and the art installation to a Resonant Reconfiguration where she releases her secret. The closure lands with emotional cost as she acknowledges her fear of disconnection. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The transformation from isolation to openness tracks causally though the middle development could deepen.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise - the tricksters' note crystallizes the ongoing conflict with visible stakes ("Let the tricksters come. She'd be ready"). However, the cost remains mostly conceptual rather than viscerally felt, and the tricksters' nature/rules stay vague throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear causal chain leads to a Charged Poise closure where Elias steps into the gateway with the key, options crystallized. The orientation anchors (cathedral, Elias, nighttime quest) establish quickly. Cost remains somewhat abstract—"whatever came next" lacks the specific price that would elevate this to higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Decisive Change through reopening the cold case, with visible cost in Clara's emotional connection to Lila. The causal chain from ribbon to sketch to handprint to locket works logically. However, the discovery sequence feels somewhat convenient, and the thematic resolution ("Empathy's never truly dormant") edges toward explicit moralizing, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a causal lens with Clara's discovery leading to investigation and attempted ritual, but closure lacks decisive change or visible cost on the page. The ending suspends at "some truths were worth the risk" without showing whether the reversal succeeds, fails, or extracts a price. The orientation is clear (weather station, Clara as librarian), and causality holds through the investigation sequence, but the final beat offers only Charged Poise without the crystallized options or undeniable pressure required.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Elias stands ready to "sculpt possibility" with newfound understanding, but the cost remains more conceptual than felt. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward transformation, though the shift from confusion to clarity happens too conveniently through exposition ("You found it...It's not just a map—it's a choice") rather than dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=4.2)
    The story attempts Accumulative/Textural structure but fails to deliver closure with visible cost—Elias simply feels "at peace" without paying a price or making a decisive choice. The foreign bills accumulate as symbols but never force a crystallizing moment. Heavy backstory (~40%) summarizes father-son dynamics without anchoring to present stakes that matter.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure building to a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lirael accepts carrying others' burdens as the path to understanding. The cost is legible when "her own grief—her brother's absence—rose to meet them" and she receives the lullaby etched in skin. Minor deduction for slightly soft orientation in the opening beats and some expository patches about the temple's nature.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the vortex sequence building toward Mira's acceptance of her buried memory. Closure lands through Resonant Reconfiguration as she reframes her guilt, with cost visible in "the strength to carry it." The who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening paragraph. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient resolution where the plant seed reveals exactly what's needed.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lirael accepts that "the intersection of dreams wasn't a place—it was a choice," with scars transformed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds through density shifts and pattern breaks. Cost remains somewhat abstract—"surrendering humanity" is declared but the actual price of the transformation isn't viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens coheres through ritual progression: entering orchard → bartering the Fool card → stitching the skeleton → eating fruit → emerging transformed. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost ("holes in her soul, once gaping wounds, now shimmered with newfound resilience"), though the keeper's explanatory dialogue slightly dilutes the earned quality.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with the grille cloth accumulating meaning through discovery, research, and connection to Echo Valley. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lenny shifts from appraising failures to resurrecting stories, with cost visible in his years of emotional insulation. The orientation is clear by ~100 words (Lenny, quarry office trailer, present day after TV failure).

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara realizes the physics of transition are "stories waiting to be retold," with the arbor's shifting roots demonstrating this principle. The accumulative lens holds as details build toward this conceptual shift. However, the cost remains primarily intellectual rather than visceral, and the orientation anchors (who/where/when) could be clearer in the opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration through the smelting transformation that visibly changes the woman from sea-creature to bird-hybrid, with cost shown in her fear and dissolution. The accumulative/textural lens holds through recurring tidal imagery and identity transformations, though the child's section slightly dilutes the closure's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias transforms from bunker inspector to spiritual conduit, with visible cost (the pearl dissolves, he becomes permanently changed). The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and confessions build toward the crystalline transformation, though the multiple simultaneous transformations in distant bunkers strain credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.8)
    The accumulative structure works well as Mara discovers graffiti messages that progressively reframe forgiveness from destination to current to surrender. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when she creates her emotional map and sees "Begin" - a Charged Poise moment with clear cost in abandoning her methodical external mapping for messy internal navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres as Lira decodes the propagation delays into a pattern that reveals the hidden books. Closure lands with a Resonant Reconfiguration when she finds the library of unspoken words, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt - "fear and excitement" doesn't fully convey what she's risked or lost.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Lira's dismantling of the dream "piece by piece" with visible cost ("only the ache remained"). The accumulative lens holds as "propagate" shifts meaning across three invocations. Yet the empire/throne element feels underdeveloped—we never understand what specific change Lira seeks or why she ultimately refuses it.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Lirael's successful preservation and the threshold returning to stillness—"a canvas, waiting for the next artist." The accumulative lens holds as density increases through the ritual's stages, with visible cost in the pool's near-destruction and Lirael's exhaustion. Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words (grotto, Lirael's role, the emerald chip).

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with Lirael's realization that contentment is "a practice—a choice to climb, to forgive" with the cost being acceptance of ongoing uncertainty. The accumulative structure coheres through recurring images (shell, hairpin, cycles). Orientation is clear by ~100 words. Deduction for the cost feeling more conceptual than viscerally felt in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira moves from paralyzed grief to active choice about "which chimes to keep," with the cost visible in removing the sharp/dissonant notes. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details (chimes, cloak weight) build toward meaning-shift. Slight opacity around the husband's actual fate prevents higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as ripple patterns accumulate meaning through repetition and variation, culminating in Lira's spiral discovery that shifts from fractal to helix. Cost is visible in Elara's patient withholding and Lira's desperate burning need. Deduction for slightly soft cost articulation—"becoming" lands conceptually but lacks the visceral price of transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=6.4)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where "navigating without moving" shifts from paradox to alignment/listening, with some cost implied through "centuries of layered dust" and generational failure. However, the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. The accumulative lens holds but the final transformation from understanding to walking "one step at a time" creates mild tension with the central paradox.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.3)
    Clear Decisive Change lands with emotional cost as Kael transforms the exotic garden into his mother's simple one, finding validation through simplicity rather than grand magic. The causal chain from entering the spire through keystone activation to garden transformation holds firmly, though the "when creativity got automated" context could better pressure his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias transforms from hiding behind truth to acknowledging his luminous vow, with the cost visible in years of denial now released. The accumulative structure builds through water imagery, light motifs, and the library discovery to the final "I see you now" moment. Orientation anchors cleanly establish pier/harbor/lantern festival setting.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as sensory details and symbolic objects build toward Kael's transformation into a universal conduit. The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael accepting his role with the universe "answering" through him. Cost is visible in the irreversible transformation, though the stakes could be sharpened earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Elias transforming the monsters from anonymous threats into named entities with "the ache of knowing." The accumulative/textural lens holds as whispers layer into voices and light refracts into revelation. Cost is legible in the weight of the page and Elias's transformed heartbeat, though the mechanics of the naming process could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the dripping rhythm building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the bell's imperfect function creates "balanced" stability. Cost is visible in Elias's exhaustion and the acknowledgment that "the bell would need constant adjustment, the rift might reopen," though the cosmic stakes feel abstract compared to the physical work. The orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words with character, setting, and situation established.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with photographs accumulating meaning toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara shifts from solitary guardian to shared memory-keeper. The closure lands with visible cost as she places her own photo among the dead's artifacts, accepting her role. Slight opacity around Elias's actual fate (ghost/metaphor ambiguity) creates minor causality friction without breaking the closure effect.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition building to synthesis moment. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara achieves the "touch of wonder" through accepting paradox, with visible cost (burned hand) and conceptual shift. Orientation anchors established early. Deduction for slightly abstract resolution that could use more concrete dramatization of the transformation's immediate effects.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Kael transforms from isolated pattern-seeker to fluent speaker of the forest's language, with visible cost in his sweat and exhaustion. The accumulative structure builds through repeated node corrections toward understanding. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two, and the lens holds consistently through pattern-based progression.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=5.2)
    The closure (merger/absorption of clone) occurs on-page but the cost remains abstract - we're told emotions return but don't feel the price. The causal chain works mechanically but "channeling complementary opposites" lacks concrete mechanics. Orientation is clear but the worldbuilding (Council of Synthesis, floating dojo) feels ornamental rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages (seed arrives → investigation → planting → growth → key discovery). The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where Elias realizes "the mystery wasn't in the seed but in the flow," though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early and maintained throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration - Marlowe successfully restores the lost laughter with visible physical and emotional cost. The accumulative structure coheres as density increases toward the climax with "a thousand tiny voices." However, the causality between the leaf blower's roar and the restoration of laughter feels metaphorically convenient rather than earned through concrete mechanics, preventing higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural closure as Mara crosses the threshold to find her mentor, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration where "boundaries of light" transform from walls to doors. The pendant's disposal and path's appearance create clear causality. Cost is visible in destroying her connection to her past's mystery and the cultist's collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Decisive Change closure: Kael transforms from paralyzed alchemist to active interruptor of destiny, paying visible cost (scarred hands, frayed mind) for freedom. The causal chain from broken crozier to creative destruction theory to sacrificial vivification holds throughout, with the penny-drop moments effectively narrowing options toward the inevitable self-sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration as the tower transforms from abandoned ruin to living network. The closure lands with visible transformation and conceptual cost (letting go enables rebirth), though the final "doorways" line edges toward explicit thematic statement.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Kael becomes "keeper of a permanent transient moment" with visible cost—the ferry dissolves, passengers vanish into merged lives, and he's left alone. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density builds through the grotto's pulsations, overlapping voices, and the final constellation image. Causality remains clean from finding the hourglass through broadcasting the pattern to the merger.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Clara's weaving creating density that culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when she discovers connection through the threads. The closure lands with her walking away transformed, though the cost remains more conceptual than felt. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two, and the pattern of weaving-to-revelation holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Lirael finds purpose through teaching others to "embrace the unknown," but the cost remains conceptual rather than visible on the page. The accumulative structure coheres but lacks a decisive tightening that would make the before/after transformation legible with felt consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain holds (photo → hearing aid → pulse → message → delivery) but the closure lacks sufficient visible cost - Lila completes her task without meaningful sacrifice or transformation. The "incidental heroism" concept is stated rather than dramatized through difficult choice. Orientation is clear by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through discovery of the codex, activation of machines, and holographic revelation. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira finds proof of her brother's existence preserved in the cables—a conceptual shift that reweights the entire search with emotional cost ("tears blurred her vision"). The orientation anchors (research facility, Lira, post-tide window) establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly mechanical resolution of the gold fleck's function.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.4)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly as Elias reframes the error from curse to compass, with felt cost in carrying the woman's "not-readiness." The accumulative lens holds as patterns (ink, heartbeats, static) build toward this reconfiguration. Deduction for slight orientation delay and some causality softness around how the porcelain shard enables defragmentation.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through bird observations culminating in resonant reconfiguration when the storyteller hurls the diamond away, accepting her role as extinction itself. The cost is visible—losing the diamond that held "the key to something deeper"—and the closure reweights her relationship to oblivion. Orientation anchors (canyon edge, towers of bone, twin moons) establish setting immediately.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through sensory density (moss, lavender, petrichor) and confession fragments until the transformation sequence reweights everything. The closure—Elara's smile and resolve to return changed—is a Resonant Reconfiguration with clear cost (abandoning her researcher role). Minor orientation wobble with the herbalist's sudden appearance deducts slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's music breaking the statues' control, with visible cost in her bleeding fingers and the orchard's transformation. The causal lens holds as each action (finding shell → learning its language → playing music → cracking statues) builds logically. The closure lands with "The orchard listened. This time, it answered" showing reciprocal change, though the cost could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the storm's release transforming the border's "brittle hush" into connection, with visible cost in the shattered bottle and risk Elias takes. The causal lens holds through most beats, but the mechanism by which the storm changes soldiers' behavior and resurrects the arcade remains underexplained. The closure lands with thematic resonance ("room to grow") but the transformation's logistics strain credibility.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the discovery sequence (fragment → hidden door → courtyard transformation). Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elio's singing transforms the courtyard and reframes silence from "end" to "beginning," though the cost remains more conceptual than felt. The orientation anchors clearly (abandoned circus train, Elio the carpenter), and causality holds, but the transformation's mechanics feel slightly convenient without deeper resistance.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Eleanor's restlessness building through sensory details toward a Resonant Reconfiguration when she accesses the space where stories live. The closure lands with her transformed presence affecting the library's vitality. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt—we see change but not what Eleanor sacrifices or risks to achieve it, weakening the before/after legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong resonant reconfiguration lands with conceptual cost - Elara realizes she's been chasing herself, transforming her understanding of the quest. The accumulative lens holds through layered imagery building to "The dream was no longer runaway; it was *hers*, etched into her bones." Minor orientation wobble with "whispering archipelago" geography but recovers through lighthouse anchoring.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with mystical elements, building through description and symbolic action toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias enters "the hush of cosmic possibility" carrying new understanding. The unlocking transforms both physical reality and Elias's comprehension, with cost shown through disorientation and the burden of the woman's secrets. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are established early, and the pattern of lock-as-key pays off at closure, though the conceptual cost could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively when Elias discovers the locket and Clara's wisp of light transforms the greenhouse from "tomb" to "bridge," with the emotional cost of forty years' obsession made visible. The accumulative structure coheres through pattern-matching (broken stars/constellations/mushroom arrangements) leading to this crystallized moment where past and present collide.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through layered imagery (shadow in glass, tea leaves, backwards walking) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the woman accepts the cost of reversing her village's exile. Orientation anchors clearly by ~120 words. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("confront what you've avoided"), though the specific price could be more visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure builds effectively toward the seed's transformation ritual, with clear orientation and a Decisive Change when the orchard is restored. The closure lands with visible transformation as "blossoms drank deeply, their petals flaring with renewed vibrancy." However, the cost feels abstract - while Elara cries with joy, there's no tangible sacrifice or foreclosed path that would elevate this to excellence.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's shift from mending to listening, with the silver key symbolizing opened possibilities. The accumulative lens holds as details build toward the final release, but the fisherman subplot and sanctuary mechanics lack causal clarity, particularly why "stars aligned" matters now.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.6)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias discovers the chapel is a "bridge" not a barrier, reweighting all prior investigation through the lens of "listening past noise." The cost—entering unknown darkness, risking the ancestral mystery—is felt through embodied details like "chest tightened" and "breath visible." Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building from discovery to revelation, with the frequency connection (440 Hz) creating meaningful linkage between past and present. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where "letting go" transforms from release to "phase transition." Cost is felt through Elara's personal grief journey. Slight deduction for the somewhat convenient alignment of the tuning fork frequency with the snow globe motor.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through encoded messages, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias presses the bluebell—shifting from encoding for others to a tangible act. However, the cost remains primarily symbolic rather than viscerally felt, and the "maybe, just maybe" hedging weakens the closure's decisiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases through diary discovery and goggle revelation building toward the widow's emotional crack. Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration as both women acknowledge the flame that "still burns," with emotional cost visible in the widow's laughter "like wind through frozen pines." However, the encrypted symbols' sudden legibility through goggles strains causality, and the spire's nature as "lens" remains conceptually vague.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lila's acceptance that proof matters less than personal transformation ("No. But it'll change *me*"). The accumulative/textural lens holds as emotional clouds build toward this crystallized stance, with visible cost in abandoning her need for external validation. The closure lands cleanly with "Wherever the clouds take us" as earned surrender to uncertainty.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern discovery building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira transforms from commissioned painter to active preserver of knowledge. The cost is legible in her risking the demolition crew's chaos to save the safe. Orientation anchors (oak tree library, demolition at dawn, Lira as painter) established within first 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure achieves a Decisive Change (Lira charts "not just a place, but a truth") with visible transformation. The causal chain from hopscotch discovery to portal leap holds, though the "stranded luminance" mechanics remain vague. Cost is implied through risk ("You're not seriously going out there?") but could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.3)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the clock beginning to tick—a concrete image that reweights the entire quest. The cost (years of isolation, pressure of legacy) is felt rather than explicitly dramatized, and the accumulative structure coheres through pattern-building toward this crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based messaging building toward collective action. However, the closure lacks visible cost—the arch is simply "mended by collective will" without sacrifice or trade-off. The resolution feels predetermined rather than earned through dramatic pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant reconfiguration closure as Mara's lullaby transforms global time perception. The cost is legible in the lighthouse groaning, pane cracking, and puppet head shattering. Strong causality through grandfather's teachings leading to this moment, though the world-building mechanics of "doomsday clock adjuster" remain slightly vague.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear causal chain: curse compels action → traveler cries → Kael uses blueprint → guides to safety → curse satisfied. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost ("frost began to bloom," "labyrinth would reset"). The orientation anchors early ("cliffside labyrinth," "Kael, the reluctant caretaker"). Missing deeper transformation limits higher scoring.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands: sisters move from isolation to shared music-making, with the chrysalis release marking transformation. The accumulative pattern (rivers→foam→reconnection) builds coherently. Cost is visible in months of avoidance and the "shaky harmony" that acknowledges imperfection.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through the catalog of absences toward Elara's final understanding. Closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing as she reconceives where stories begin, but the cost remains primarily intellectual—"grateful for the absence she'd given him"—rather than felt or visible. The who/where/when anchors establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Nessar's ritual subsumption of stored remorse creating a Resonant Reconfiguration—the fortress feels "sturdier, its brittleness tempered." Cost is visible when "the founder's guilt becoming his own" and the physical toll ("legs unsteady"), though the connection between absorbing guilt and the guards' softened expressions needs stronger causality.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.2)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the community gathering and symbolic bridge-building, with some visible cost in Elara's effort. However, the transformation feels too smooth - the villagers' instant understanding and the tower's magical responsiveness lack earned causality. The accumulative pattern holds but the final convergence feels mechanically orchestrated.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Decisive Change - Kael successfully transforms the mirror and himself through memory entanglement, with visible cost in the bleeding of painful memories ("faces of his disillusioned team, the taste of defeat"). Causal linkage is strong throughout, though the mechanism of "synaptic plasticity" applied to glass strains credibility slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lira's transformation into a threshold guardian, with the key as tangible proof of change. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details build toward the gravity inversion climax. Causality weakens when the manuscript spontaneously rearranges into a map without established rules, and the cost of transformation remains more implied than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where the grove becomes "a cathedral of sound" with clear cost (shattered insulator, bleeding nails, years of work). The accumulative lens holds consistently through density increases and pattern teaching. Orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as silence gradually translates through stone, memory, and revelation, building to the star-seed planting that reconfigures the covenant from document to living thing. The closure lands with conceptual cost (exile validated through lonely discovery) and visible transformation (sprouting sapling). Deduction for the keyhole/key revelation feeling mechanically convenient despite thematic resonance, and for slight ambiguity in how the hologram projection works.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration lands when Lirael transforms silence from "walls" to "bridges" with visible emotional cost in understanding her grandmother's buried pain. The accumulative lens holds as density increases through diary entries revealing layers of silence. Who/where/when anchored early ("shadowed workshop under stars"). The vibration-discovery mechanism creates meaningful deepening that reweights the central metaphor.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the corpse flower's growth paralleling Lira's understanding of patience. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when the bloom harmonizes the village and validates her approach, with visible communal transformation as cost paid. However, the resolution feels somewhat predetermined—the flower blooms exactly as hoped without meaningful complication.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to revelation, with the arrow tip's integration into the pedestal creating a decisive change in understanding. The closure lands with conceptual cost - Lira abandons exploitation for guardianship. Minor orientation wobble with the gravity inversion timing being somewhat unclear initially.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing where the port reveals itself as a hungry machine, but the cost remains largely abstract—"some machines, once awakened, never truly sleep" gestures at consequence without making it visceral. The accumulative build through wind patterns and the patch's vibrations creates texture, yet the final transformation from investigation to cosmic horror feels slightly unearned given the realistic opening.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration lands with the cavern's transformation from "sculpted hush" to living hymn, with clear cost (Lira's physical exertion, Veyra's worldview shift). The accumulative lens holds throughout, building density through color/sound layering toward the final harmonious state.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Kael's shift from seeking answers in echoes to understanding silence's power, with visible cost in the broken flute. Causal linkage holds: playing the flute → chamber opens → confrontation with past failures → breaking the flute → learning its true nature. The orientation anchors (Thunder-Echo Range, relic keeper, three moons since mentor's death) establish context within the first 120 words. Closure lands with the new rune for "surrender" paying off the earlier driftwood markers.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration closure: Elias shifts from believing emotions are variables to understanding them as "rhythms to be felt," with visible cost in his tears and the destruction of his analytical framework. The causal chain holds from his deliberate ambiguity method through the fragment's response to the final integration. Orientation anchors workshop/stars/fragment clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Conceptual Repricing when Kail realizes "Veyra's absence wasn't an ending—it was a germination," reframing his relationship with his mentor and his role as courier. The cost is his transformation from passive vessel to active participant, though this conceptual shift could be more viscerally felt. The hybrid lens holds, with accumulative vibrations leading to causal understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The closure achieves a Conceptual Repricing where Mara discovers the arbor mirrors rather than absorbs emotions, reweighting all prior visions with clear conceptual cost ("her assumptions had shattered"). The accumulative build through frost patterns, prism channeling, and visions coheres well, though the glass shattering feels slightly convenient as a triggering mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where Mara transforms from weaving cloth to "weaving silence itself," with clear cost (losing the ancestral beads). The accumulative structure coheres well through pattern-building. Minor orientation wobble with the sudden "rummage sale box" appearance feels slightly unmotivated within the established mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear causal chain from silk arrival → mine exploration → confrontation with planet's pain → healing achieves closure with visible cost (blood drawn, pain endured). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands as orchards bloom and arches steady. However, Lira's convenient appearance and exposition-heavy middle weakens the otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Decisive Change occurs when Kael throws the shard into the portal, foreclosing his obsessive search with visible cost ("could still smell the ozone of that other world"). The causal lens holds throughout with because/therefore linkages from shard discovery to portal opening to confrontation with alternate mother. Minor deduction for the slightly abstract final insight about truth being "a thread, weaving through every choice."

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.6)
    The accumulative structure coheres as each letter and stone-stacking builds toward Elias's recognition that these gestures "bottle" safety when the lighthouse fails. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through his final descent with "the sea glass warm in his pocket," showing acceptance of connection over isolation with the cost of abandoning his reticent stance clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the Herald crystallizes her role as "keeper of the flame, steward of shadows" with the dawn as both temporal and metaphysical choice. The accumulative build through shadow-visions to final acceptance works well. Cost is present but could be more visceral; we feel the weight of responsibility but not what she sacrifices to bear it.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Lin's crystallized understanding of her new purpose, with the donor heart serving as both literal and metaphorical transformation. The accumulative/textural lens holds as sensory details and observations build toward Lin's realization about illuminating stories. Cost is felt through the wing's disappearance and Lin's acceptance of her role as story-keeper.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density building through layered discoveries (sextant disassembly → dream mapping → tree memories). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias glimpses "even in decay, there was beauty," but the cost remains abstract—we see healing and revelation without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively as Lira's humming spreads light and memory through both realms, with visible cost in her exhaustion and the realm's gradual awakening. The accumulative structure coheres well, though the twin realm's mechanics could be clearer earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Eleanor's acceptance that hiding is selective revelation, with clear cost in confronting her mother's letters and choosing to stay. The accumulative/textural lens holds as details build toward the final image of Eleanor cradled with letters, though the orientation anchors arrive slightly late (~150 words for full clarity of the society's nature).

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres around Elias's shift from observer to cultivator, with the bread/seed transformation and the woman's arrival crystallizing his new role. The closure achieves resonant reconfiguration through "learned to see" with visible cost in his calloused hands, though the woman's function feels slightly mechanical.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with frequency sampling building toward restoration, and achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as the library's magic brightens. However, the cost remains abstract—"exhaustion melting away" contradicts rather than confirms sacrifice, and the resolution feels too neat given the established stakes of the library potentially crumbling.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages from Lira's investigation through to her destructive choice. Closure lands as a Decisive Change when she smashes the device, with visible cost in the cracked watch fob and her acceptance of her father's "comforting unease" legacy. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly by line 3, and the midnight deadline creates effective temporal pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through sensory details (lavender to salt to copper taste) building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael accepts the unexplainable. The closure lands with felt cost—"lavender and regret"—as his worldview shifts. The forests' election concept and compass evolution provide coherent pressure that crystallizes in the final recognition.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias opens the shadow-door and feels "a rush of relief, as if a dam had burst inside him," with the cost being years of suppressed creativity. The accumulative texture builds effectively through crystalline imagery and echoing patterns. However, the closure's cost feels more told than dramatized—we're informed of relief rather than witnessing the specific price paid for this transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara transforms the empty orb into "a seed" with visible emotional cost—accepting her mother's absence while finding presence in memory. The accumulative lens holds as details (toxic sky, dried oasis, crystallized conversations) cohere into meaning. Deduction for slightly rushed pacing in the Archive reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=6.4)
    The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through the kinetic sculpture creation. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration where the iceberg's transformation into permanent symphony suggests continuity, but the cost remains abstract—we see the ice melt but not what Elara sacrifices or forecloses. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Clara-7's transformation from containing chaos externally to integrating it internally, with visible cost (the static remains but transforms). Orientation anchors clearly by ~100 words. The accumulative structure builds coherently through box→burn→integration. Deduction for slight abstraction in how the "miniaturization" actually works mechanically, though the metaphorical weight carries it.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with neighborhood stories building toward the mailbox opening. The closure moment (reading the letters) provides a Resonant Reconfiguration with emotional cost visible in Clara's tears. However, the combination lock solution feels mechanically convenient, and the cost remains primarily observational rather than forcing Clara to sacrifice or change.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from descent through dance-decoding to antidote retrieval, with the decisive change (obtaining the plague cure) landing with clear cost. The dance-as-code revelation provides the crucial turn that enables closure. Slight deduction for the convenience of security drones being defeated by chaotic dancing without fuller mechanical grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story follows a causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage (coffee patterns → wall discovery → tunnel → memory chamber), but the closure lacks visible cost. While Elias gains new purpose, we never see him pay a price or face a true choice between recovering his wife's memories versus helping others. The resolution feels too neat—he simply decides to help others without confronting what he's lost.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the crane ritual building toward preventing the prophecy's manifestation. While the closure technically lands (prophecy hushed), the cost remains abstract—we're told the haven would be destroyed but never feel what the summoner sacrifices or risks. The prophecy code and its resolution lack concrete dramatization, making the stakes feel declared rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Charged Poise closure where Elias speaks to the building and receives an answer, crystallizing the moment of transformation with the library's shudder and responding voice. The causal chain from cryptic note to seal to revelation to action holds coherently. The cost—accepting the impossible and risking failure or madness—is implied through the physical sensations ("teeth ache") and the finality of the act, though it could be more viscerally rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through the shell ritual that reweights Lirael's relationship to memory. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when she transforms archived pain into "constellations of light" and walks away "free," with visible cost in the garden's destruction. The orientation anchors clearly (velvet garden, twilight, Lirael with seashell), though the "resonance structures" mechanism lacks sufficient grounding to fully support the transformation's causality.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lirael's forgery act building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—she completes and hides the treaty as "prayer," transforming treason into grace. The closure lands with conceptual cost ("leaving only the echo of her purpose"), though the immediate dramatic stakes could be heightened by more present danger or consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration occurs when Kael understands his purpose shifts from singing for beauty to preserving trapped stories - "for the first time, he felt the canyon sing back—not in echo, but in answer." The accumulative lens holds as revelations layer toward this crystallized understanding with felt cost in accepting this burden.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with three dream fragments building toward Kael's resolution to weave truth into the living's dreams. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration where connections between living and dead are restored with emotional cost visible in each relationship. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph, and the pattern of dream analysis is taught early and paid off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition building to Kael's realization about the fireflies' coded message. The closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing where he grasps "the world's beauty lay not in its grandeur but in its hidden labor," though the cost remains primarily intellectual rather than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from discovery to closure with clear Decisive Change - Mara seals the stillpoint at personal cost. The flawed/flawless diamond revelation provides meaningful reversal. Cost is visible in the final paragraphs as radiation drops and hope emerges. Minor orientation issue with "three weeks ago" timeline not fully anchored.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands effectively - Kael becomes "both seer and storm" with the portico transforming from window to threshold. The accumulative structure coheres through radio transmissions, storm imagery, and the hourglass's sand reversing. Deducting for abstract cost - while transformation occurs, the personal price remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres well - each jar of sound builds toward the music box's transformation and Elias's public performance creates resonant reconfiguration with visible impact ("faces soften, heard laughter where there'd been only silence"). The closure shows genuine cost through the old woman's emotional recognition. Minor deduction for the parenthetical word count announcement which breaks the narrative frame.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    Causal lens holds with clear because/therefore linkage: key's distress summons ghost → Elias uses resonator → frequencies harmonize → ghost accepts bridge concept. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration with Elias accepting his role as "guardian of frequencies," though the cost could be more visceral beyond exhaustion.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure builds through repeated attempts at alignment, with the successful unyoking serving as resonant reconfiguration that transforms the sanctuary's energy. Cost is visible in Kael's physical exhaustion and the "patient revolution" that requires abandoning haste, though the final teaching moment with the acolyte slightly dilutes the closure's intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows a Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkage as Mara's investigation leads to discovering Cole's conspiracy files. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Mara decides to expose Cole using "empirical observation" rather than the lantern's emotional entanglement. However, the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—we understand she's breaking free but don't feel what she's sacrificing. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the clockwork heart metaphor building density toward Marcus's realization that redemption requires "deliberate, meaningful steps." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Marcus commits to transforming the program, with cost visible in accepting responsibility for men who "hurt someone badly." Who/where/when anchored clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.6)
    Resonant Reconfiguration lands clearly: the bell that "no one hears yet" transforms from metaphor to actual vibration that "rippled through the acid sea." The accumulative structure coheres as kaleidoscope patterns translate into glider adjustments, building to the final hum. Cost is felt through the dangerous dive and the irreversible hurling of the treasured arrow tip. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~60 words.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.4)
    The causal chain holds well - each discovery leads to the next revelation, culminating in Lira's escape with the coordinates. The closure shows a Decisive Change as she shifts from corporate investigator to fugitive pursuing truth. However, the cost remains somewhat abstract ("her mind racing toward the edge") rather than viscerally felt on the page. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara transforming the storm by "giving it a heart," with visible cost implied through the fragments of tragedy she absorbs. The accumulative/textural lens holds as density increases through the mirror visions. The orientation is clear early (lighthouse keeper, ice floes, approaching storm). Deduction for the somewhat abstract nature of the storm's transformation—while poetic, the exact mechanism of how empathy quiets meteorological chaos remains opaque.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lila's shift from seeking "final tranquility" to finding "a flicker of something like peace" after the rescue. The orientation is clear early, and the accumulative structure builds through ice/cold imagery toward this earned moment. Deduction for the somewhat convenient timing of finding the trapped woman, though the emotional cost of Lila's journey remains legible.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "two mismatched souls began to rediscover the beauty of their own imperfect dance." However, the cost remains abstract—Lila's smile and laughter signal change but don't show what she's giving up or risking. The pavilion-vineyard-station geography anchors clearly, but the transformation lacks visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=5.2)
    The consecration ritual completes with the echo preserved, providing closure through Earned Stasis. However, the mystical mechanics ("kinetic parapet," "conjured clearings") remain opaque, making the stakes and cost abstract. The piece teaches its pattern but the actual transformation—what changes between before/after—stays conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increases toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (the word "enough" and return with camera). However, the closure lacks visible cost—Lila's transformation from sketching to photographing doesn't show what she's giving up or risking. The orientation is clear early (who/where/when established in opening).

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=5.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern recognition building toward epiphany, but lacks a decisive on-page closure with visible cost. Elias's decision to "testify" remains abstract—we never see him actually speaking or facing resistance. The crystal's fall appears coincidental rather than causally earned. The final image of the crystal catching light provides resonance but no concrete change in options or stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern breaks and density increases building to Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias accepts present echoes over future visions. Cost is legible in "I was here. I heard it. I remembered" - the chalk line thicker and bolder signals acceptance of fragments over wholeness. Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (Elias, sculpture garden, fog).

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story achieves Charged Poise at closure with Elias poised at the portal, but the causal chain from clock malfunction to portal opening feels mechanically convenient rather than inevitable. The "escape velocity" concept shifts from metaphor to literal physics without sufficient grounding. Orientation anchors arrive late (observatory location/function unclear until mid-story).

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase building to Elias's death and the vinyl shard's transfer to Clara. The closure lands with felt cost through death and legacy continuation. Orientation anchors establish clearly by ~100 words. Minor deduction for the slightly convenient timing of Elias finding his voice.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Strong causal chain from key discovery through astronomical alignment to revelation. The closure lands with a Conceptual Repricing as shadows revealed as temporal gateways reweight the entire magical system. Cost is implied through "time flowed backward" but could be more visceral. Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Mara's realization that "the garden's not a trick... It's a mirror," with visible cost in both characters' acknowledgment of avoidance. The causal chain from tooth-as-key to bone-setting metaphor to reconciliation holds coherently. The cost appears in their mutual recognition of lost time, though the exact nature of Elias's sacrifice could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong accumulative structure building through gem-polishing to the pearl's release. The closure—pearl dissolving into sky—delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the pearl is given away). The mother's lessons frame and reweight the ending effectively. Minor orientation delay but serves the mystical atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through the grafting metaphor realized in action—planting the sapling together with "hands brushing in the soil." Cost is visible in Lila's acceptance that "grafting isn't permanent. It's a conversation." Deduction for slightly mechanical setup of the viral confession backstory that doesn't fully integrate with present pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Clara's manuscript revision—she trades closure for openness with visible cost (destroying finished work). The accumulative structure coheres as mist-shapes build toward her acceptance of unfinished things. Deduction for the guide-figure's overly explicit thematic articulation mid-story, though the ending image recovers well.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increasing through golden threads, luminous mushrooms, and dancing creatures toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira shifts from solo remedy to communal tending. Cost appears in the spent tendril and Lira's aching hands, though the emotional price of depending on others could be sharper. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story achieves a Conceptual Repricing when Elias understands the map reveals "not just where to go, but how to feel," reweighting his quest from external navigation to internal understanding. The accumulative texture builds effectively through ritual actions. However, the cost remains primarily conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page—we see his "chest heaving with emotion" but not what specific path or option he's foreclosing.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with density increase through layered discoveries about the timer's true function. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Elias completes the timer and witnesses the harvest of echoes, with visible cost implied through the "wounded season" healing. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish clearly by ~100 words.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Kael refuses his mother's burden, accepting incompleteness as necessary—"Some burdens...were meant to stay buried." The accumulative lens holds as fractals literally accumulate in his satchel. Deduction for cost being more implied than viscerally felt at the final beat, though the "restless spirits" and fragmented melody carry weight.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Clara's carved lion becoming a vessel for transformation. The accumulative lens holds as density increases toward the final image of "carving the void into something that could hold the light." Cost is visible in the months of avoidance and the acceptance that loss is transformation, not ending.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Veyra collecting fragments leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration when she releases the camera wheel and accepts rest. The rose transformation and her departure create visible change with implied cost (drowning/transcendence ambiguity). However, the ghost's exact nature remains unclear, and the mechanics of how dropping the camera wheel leads to transformation lack causal clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Lila's transformation of the terminal from decay to purposeful light, with cost visible in the "raw, untested" equation requiring future validation. The causal lens holds as each discovery leads to the next action, though the sextant's cosmic properties feel somewhat convenient rather than earned through prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira will "scribe clocks by day, but by night, she would listen" — a synthesis that accepts both sides with visible emotional cost shown in "her first true smile in years." The accumulative texture builds from petrichor through crystal song to the final "silence between beats, where dreams breathe."

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Elias discovering the sundial leads to the warehouse and blueprint, creating a DC where he gains "clarity to see the world as it truly was." The closure lands but the cost remains conceptual rather than visceral—we understand he's changed but don't feel what he's lost or sacrificed for this knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds as density increases through knot revelations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where "the act of preservation itself" becomes the weavers' true legacy. The cost is primarily conceptual—Elias must abandon his search for a physical loom—though the emotional price could be more viscerally felt at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=6.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres around the thread as a memory-holder, building to Elara's spectral encounter that reframes absence as connection. The closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through the insight that "even in absence, we are woven together," with some emotional cost in Elara's "lonesome splendor." However, the final third becomes repetitive with variations on the healing geography concept, and the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story achieves closure through Resonant Reconfiguration as the egg hatches and transforms the palace, with visible cost in Corvin's years of isolation and struggle. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds as details build toward the transformation. However, the sudden appearance of Elder Thalos undermines causality—his arrival lacks setup and feels convenient. The cost, while present in Corvin's "bedraggled form" and "years hypothesizing," could be more viscerally felt at the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with resonant closure through the "scars can sing" motif paying off in action and final reflection. The bird-healing sequence meaningfully transforms Lira's relationship to damage and growth, with visible cost in releasing what we help. Slight dock for the final paragraph's mild abstraction diluting the otherwise strong image-based closure.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-based collection building to resonant reconfiguration when fountains roar back to life. The closure lands with visible cost ("fingers scraped raw") and conceptual weight as memories dance freely. The breadcrumb progression creates solid because/therefore linkage, though the eighth item's revelation through vision feels slightly convenient rather than fully earned through prior pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through petals, pinging, and light imagery that culminates in Lumin's decision to carry forward "a gentler flame." The closure lands with Resonant Reconfiguration—Lumin's understanding shifts from fire-as-destruction to fire-as-whisper. The cost is legible in the abandoned gear and the weight of generational responsibility, though the transformation could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration through Marlow's poem and decision to "carve a new gravestone...shaped not by loss, but by love," with visible cost in confronting unspoken losses. The accumulative structure coheres through nightly visits building to transformation. The spectral voice mechanism feels slightly convenient but doesn't break causality.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    Strong accumulative/textural structure with the Hush concept creating legitimate pressure that builds toward resonant reconfiguration. The closure lands with visible cost (raw hands, sealed cracks) and the "incremental absolution" theme pays off through action. The transition from discovery to tower climb could be tighter—the causal link between finding the inscription and knowing to align it with the runes feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration as Elara reframes her role from tending graves to tending time, with the cost being the weight of knowledge she now carries. The accumulative pattern holds as threads reveal meaning, though the conceptual leap to "gardener of time" feels slightly unearned by the specific discoveries.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with pattern-building through observation leading to a Decisive Change when the ice thaws. Closure lands on-page with visible cost (the splintered quill, burned journals) and reconfigures the village's reality. The who/where/when anchors establish early and causality holds throughout. Minor deduction for the somewhat convenient timing of the equinox thaw exactly as predicted.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through repeated broadcast fragments and moss glow patterns toward a Charged Poise ending where Lira steps into night as "a pirate broadcaster in her own right." While the final image reweights her role from receiver to transmitter, the cost remains more conceptual than visceral—we see dedication but not sacrifice or foreclosed options.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The accumulative structure coheres as Lira moves from preparation through creation to departure, with the portrait's incompleteness serving as both method and meaning—a Resonant Reconfiguration where art's temporality becomes the truth rather than the obstacle. The cost appears in "fatigue and resolve" and the acceptance that "everything matters" despite vanishing, though the emotional price could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    The piece establishes clear orientation and builds texture through sedimentary metaphor, but closure disappoints. While Elias declares all narratives are "true," this Conceptual Repricing lacks visible cost—Mara simply stays, but nothing fundamental changes. The "city's heartbeat" moment gestures toward resonance without delivering transformation or foreclosing options.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Clara gathering diverse voices to preserve vanishing arts, culminating in the library becoming a sanctuary. The closure shows Resonant Reconfiguration through the choir's formation, but the cost remains abstract—we don't see what Clara sacrifices or risks. The piece teaches its pattern of musical preservation early but the transformation from two musicians to a full choir happens in summary rather than dramatized beats.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.4)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—the plant's transformation represents both physical and metaphorical rewiring, with future visions replacing traumatic past. Cost is visible in Elara's physical exhaustion and years of preparation, though the transformation feels slightly too smooth for maximum impact.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds from routine tallying to collective wonder restoration, with the lacquer box riddle serving as the pivotal revelation. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Clara's new role transforms the city's relationship with wonder, with cost visible in her exposed vulnerability. Slight weakness in the convenience of Voss appearing exactly when needed, though the pattern coheres well overall.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=5.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with Lira arranging objects to test her theory, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the bay becomes sanctified. However, the cost remains abstract—we see golden light and "listening" houses but no concrete price paid or path foreclosed. The transformation lacks visible stakes or trade-offs that would elevate the closure beyond atmospheric success.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Decisive Change closure - Mara drinks the ampoule and catalyzes the garden's revival, with visible cost (her transformation implied). Causality is strong throughout, with each revelation building logically. The three revelations about the grandmother, the blight, and Lumen cascade effectively, though the final cost to Mara could be more explicitly rendered.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration through Charged Poise: Kael creates perpetual motion in the dice's endless orbit, transforming his relationship to loss from possession to witnessing. The cost is legible—he cannot touch what he's created, accepting distance as the price of understanding. The accumulative lens holds as mathematical proofs, dice throws, and ruptures build toward this crystallized moment.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.2)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where "To love is to translate" reweights the entire search for lost languages and kindness. The revelation that Lila painted Elena from Mr. Voss's voice creates meaningful connection with visible emotional cost. Accumulative structure coheres well through moon/brush/language motifs.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The accumulative structure coheres around art's revival through teaching, with the bread-making serving as bridge from preservation to practice. The closure—Lila lifting her initialed loaf while planning rehearsals—achieves Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (the beekeeper's absence, the effort required). Orientation anchors solidly by line 3, and the textural build from museum tour to communal baking pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clear Decisive Change: Elias activates the hunger stone through the yoyo mechanism, reanimating the lighthouse and opening a path forward—"Fate's design had been a lock; he'd just picked it." The causal chain from discovering the stone's hollow chamber to mercury coil modification to final activation holds cleanly. Cost is visible in his father's death chasing this dream and Elias's years of isolation as "pariah and prophet," though the immediate cost at closure could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.2)
    Clear Causal lens with because/therefore linkage: curse leads to isolation, near-death awakens cloak's power, paradoxical dictionary guides confrontation, welcoming the shadow dissolves it. Closure lands as Decisive Change when Mara absorbs the shadow's power into the cloak with physical cost (seared skin). The orientation is clean by ~100 words, and the single-scene funhouse maintains unity, though Vey's cryptic final exchange feels slightly detached from the main arc.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Resonant Reconfiguration closure where chaos transforms into "order—a mosaic of planks, kelp, and fruit" with visible cost (exhaustion, "chest heaving"). The accumulative structure builds coherently through sound layering, though the "fractal generating method" remains somewhat abstract. Who/where/when anchored immediately in opening lines.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong Accumulative/Textural structure builds through pattern discoveries, shell fractures, and the watchers' movement toward a Conceptual Repricing closure where Lira realizes the shells are alive and hungry. The cost is legible in the city's screaming people and ground heaving as shells crack open. Minor orientation wobble with the watchers' nature could be clearer earlier, but the lens holds and closure lands with undeniable conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with successful Conceptual Repricing closure—Elara's realization that "lies, even noble ones, erode unless balanced by courage" reweights the entire premise with clear conceptual cost. The tunnel discovery and timeline revelation provide meaningful tightening that changes Elara's understanding from simple lie-detection to recognizing collaborative survival. Who/where/when anchored clearly by ~80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Resonant Reconfiguration lands through Elara's discovery connecting her to her grandmother's actual presence in the pavilion, reweighting "interlaced absence" from metaphor to lived reality. The accumulative structure coheres as each discovery - note placement, chamber finding, desk recognition - deepens the theme. Cost appears as emotional recognition ("The water did not erase you") though could be more visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: blackout leads to exploration, stamp discovery enables vault access, journal reveals truth that reweights Lira's purpose. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration when Lira accepts the burden of sharing difficult truth, with cost visible in "heavy" truth and long swim home. The owl stamp's transformation from order-ritual to vigilance symbol charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story builds through layered imagery (ascending/descending basilica, lanterns as dream recorders, origami cranes taking flight) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the protagonist transforms from fleeing shadow to confronting it with "I see you...I'm not afraid." Cost is visible in the "luminous torment" and "brittle as winter ice" laughter, with grief transformed into something that can fly.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong causal chain from wedding destruction through observatory hunt to node access, with clear closure as Elara transforms into a "seer" at visible cost (lost observatory, isolation). The "unused potential is anger/grief" revelation lands with earned weight. Minor deduction for slight orientation delay and some expository dialogue with Orion.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with Lira's discovery progressing through because/therefore linkages: tracking leads to observatory, scanning reveals alignment, pulling lever activates the chip assembly. The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration where "belonging is resonance" reweights the quest, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) establish cleanly in the opening paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through driftwood discoveries that reweight Elias's understanding, culminating in his decision to reveal the erased brother (Decisive Change with cost). The pattern of silence/erasure accumulates—from chipped teacup to carved "Silence" to the brother's deletion—creating resonant pressure. Minor orientation delay (Lila's physical presence unclear) doesn't harm closure. The cost lands clearly: "wondered if Lila would forgive him...betrayal."

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with the drawer pull as recurring motif, building toward Clara's release of it as Earned Stasis—she chooses to let go rather than carry this particular mistake. Cost is visible when she drops the pull into the mist, though the exchange itself proceeds too smoothly to generate maximum pressure. The parallel reveal of Elias's matching pull provides resonant reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear Resonant Reconfiguration as Clara shifts from navigating by inherited tools to "the weight of her own choices." The accumulative/textural lens holds as memories and images layer toward her final stance.

Causality holds through because/therefore linkages even within the lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal spine: decode keys → open bench → descend to vault → scavengers close in → sacrifice vial to escape. Closure lands on the page with cost (spending a precious vial; burning the arrow’s purpose), and the constraint of time pressure is coherent. A touch of convenience—the instant rooting vines—leans toward fable but is prefigured by the vault’s quasi‑mythic aura. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; single‑POV and scope are well‑contained.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation and causality are strong: vials → crucible → insufficiency → root → eruption → mold → insertion. Closure lands on the page as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing—she chooses to hear the absence with cost (pain, acceptance of fracture).

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the thaw, the bookmark’s reprise, and the schematic discovery deepen the dominant stake. Closure lands via a Conceptual Repricing: he abandons perfection for an ethos of embracing cracks, charged by the final image. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. Cost is soft but legible as a real renunciation of a prior goal frame.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear causal chain: shell draws Lila to library → decrypts notes → enforcer confrontation → escape → weeks‑later consequence (arrest) and mother meeting. Orientation is crisp and the two‑shard structure holds. Closure blends Decisive Change and Charged Poise: she reframes fear as leverage and withholds the shell from her mother at cost. The off‑stage arrest slightly diffuses on‑page culmination.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of hushes and image patterning tighten toward the last star’s extinction. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: she draws by absence; fear yields to charged poise as darkness falls and the map glows. Orientation is clean from the opening. The cost is primarily conceptual and physical strain rather than a hard sacrifice, but it’s legible in the final cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is crisp (who/where/when) and the accumulative/textural drive holds: violin → music → loop traversal → weaving → earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural drive: details (doodles → lens → crystals) build toward a conceptual repricing where logging yields to listening. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and each beat coheres causally enough for the chosen lens. Closure lands in the “Begin” ticket and the doodled lens—a reweighted role with a quiet, credible price. The cost is mostly conceptual; a more explicit foreclosing gesture beyond not writing would lift impact.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure is a conceptual repricing (beauty in cracks; maze blooms “because of” wounds). Orientation is clean and the pattern (marbles/maze/algorithms vs touch) holds. The on‑page demonstration (blocking a sensor to force recalibration) provides the lone tightening, but the cost is soft. Closure lands, though largely thematic rather than consequence‑driven.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: activation → destabilization → recalibration → stabilized outcome → renewed intent. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/charged poise: proof is achieved, risk tasted, curiosity sharpened. Cost is implied (threat to specimens/station) but not materially paid beyond stress. Single-scene focus and anchors are crisp and hold the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative/textural drive is consistent: atmosphere and pattern recognition build to a charged vow. Causality holds—water reveals symbols; the surge destroys the program; therefore she commits from memory. Closure is on‑page with cost (artifact lost, promise made against pressure). Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the single‑scene structure stays tight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning causal: discovery of the QUARANTINE file tightens pressure and motivates the decisive departure; closure lands with cost through renunciation. Orientation is swift and clean; the two‑shard structure (station → village) resolves to a single closure unit. The institutional cover‑up is mostly implied, but the on‑page beats suffice for earned change.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is tight: rumor → tunnel → wheel fits intake → shaft opens → descent → wheel in panel → hologram reveal → conceptual repricing. Orientation is clean early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece escalates via a patterned descent guided by folds, culminating in a reweighted final state. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis—having paid the cost of loosening identity, the keeper returns with options reweighted and burden lightened. Causality remains coherent between folds and thresholds; the price is visible (“their grip on reality now a faint echo”). Stakes are quiet and internal, but the cadence shift on entering/leaving the refuge makes the before/after legible.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the eclipse compresses time while music and memory layer toward a cadence shift. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: Mara reprices “just hair” and accepts the curl, a before/after legible in the glow’s rise and fade. Orientation is clean and props/payoffs are kept. Cost is understated but present in the relinquishment of skepticism and the acceptance of a talisman.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene accumulative structure tightens through discoveries (tapestry → letters → cross-reference → recognition) toward a clear on-page reconfiguration as the chorus rises. Orientation is crisp from the opening; causality reads as “attention unlocks response.” Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the world has not gone silent, we have. The cost is implied—accepting the haunting burden of listening—though it could be more explicit.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: storm-night writing → decision to seek the safehouse → letters reframe the fortunes → commitment to act (flare, dockworker fortune). Orientation is crisp within the first paragraph and holds. Closure lands as a decisive stance with immediate consequence (dockworker’s reaction), though the on‑page price is light. The inferred lens is Causal and remains consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pressure builds via layered loops and paradoxes until the anchor cracks and void opens; closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when he stabilizes a dynamic equilibrium and forecloses the possession. Cost is legible: the anchor disintegrates and the prior stabilizing order is lost in favor of flux. Orientation is clean from the start and the pattern is taught and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dawn’s progression, the shell’s intensifying glow, and the approach of customers tighten cadence toward a Charged Poise closure (“it was enough”). Orientation is clean from the outset, and the closure reweights the premise (fortunes as maps, not predictions). The felt price (exhaustion, renunciation of predictive authority in favor of memory) lands, if gently. Stakes never fracture causality or drift, though cost could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the approach to the first arch, the right-path choice, and the montage of forks cohere toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with cost (tablet disintegrates; she chooses to descend and walk). Orientation is clean, and no rule-breaking conveniences appear. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the coil, reversed records, sympathetic drums, and communal adoption build to a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn. Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when are clear), and the montage “Days passed” remains coherent within one arc. Closure lands with conceptual repricing—the broken needle recast as a gift—and the emotional cost is legible in the ache and tears. Slight softness arises from minimal resistance after the first attempt succeeds.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: mysterious note compels investigation; rooftop detour narrows options; biohazard alarm and the doctor’s reveal deepen stakes; vial handoff produces a decisive mission. Closure lands with a before/after: he burns the note and commits to public witness (Decisive Change with a Charged Poise final image). Cost is present but light on the page; danger is implied more than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the UV activation and inhalation intensify pressure toward a conceptual re‑pricing of grief. Orientation is early and clean, and the reveal deepens options/meaning rather than flipping them mechanically. The closure is on‑page with cost (tears, risk embraced) and a before/after stance. Slight gentleness of external stakes keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from arrival to the rope’s unraveling, culminating in a reweighted final image (spiral with a single thread).

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres: dusk’s peak charge → client arrival → test → purchase → closing cadence with the petal cased. Closure lands as a quiet Charged Poise: a transaction ethically framed, with the cost (joy will be subsumed) made explicit. Orientation is clean from the outset. The cost is more stated than felt, but the cadence shift and final image provide a credible ending unit.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the envelope → boardinghouse → locket → forged letter → ripple is coherent and culminates in a conceptual repricing (“I notice now too”). Closure lands with cost (ethical grayness and a renunciation of strict truth for compassion). Multiple time hops are clean and serve the cadence. Cause/therefore is present enough, with the fan’s breeze initiating the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal. Because‑therefore links hold: study tags → meet Lira → follow light angles → decode date/time → arrive → reveal.

Orientation is clean and the single‑scene arc is coherent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp early (rooftop canal, assignment, editor’s warning), and a single scene escalates to a tunnel‑moment and returns with a reweighted stance. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: she reframes the pendant as uncaging time and the giant as guardian, with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in her vow to return. Causality holds (warming pendant → fissure → choice → revelation → reentry), with felt if subtle cost. The Hybrid lens tilts Accumulative at the end and stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual action layers (placing, aligning, pouring sap) until the mosaic reconfigures, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of loss. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. Closure lands on the page with cost (tears, renunciation of preservation as stasis) and a reweighted rule-set. The because/therefore causality is soft but coherent within the lyric design.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain: tape fragment → intensified memory → pursuit through pipe chases → decoder → message → choice to become a messenger. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (identity shift with implied cost to her invisibility). The “Project Lumen—Decoder” appears rather conveniently, softening the felt price of the pursuit. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the single-scene coherence holds.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning causal: the hellebore’s retraction precipitates Eleanor’s choice to not intervene, culminating in an on‑page stance shift the next morning. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with an earned renunciation—she commits to helping “by releasing control.” Cost is present but primarily conceptual/procedural rather than dramatized loss. Orientation is clean; shard transitions are smooth.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens (textural accrual with causal turns) holds: rain → brooch → exchange → painting → repriced understanding. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a concrete act (grinding the brooch) and a before/after legible in the final image. Minor continuity haze about the brooch’s state at the end slightly softens the lock. Otherwise clean orientation and payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens holds: pilgrim arrives → offers pearl → Elara chooses → rupture → altered stasis. Closure lands with cost on the page (shattered crystals, vanished pearl, altered song) and a clear before/after in her perception. Orientation is immediate (who/where/when) and never slips. No soft reset; the new equilibrium feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the staggered‑interval structure across three sites builds meaning that culminates in the trumpet’s completion and sounding. Beats connect causally through the valve as beacon, and closure lands on the page. The price (time, patience, social reticence around the plaza) is modest but legible. No orientation debt; the mosaic pattern is taught early and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: arrows → hidden wall → descent → pedestal → hologram → “Begin” → reconfigured map. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the fortress is a choice, not a place, and his options are reweighted by the new map. Orientation is strong from the opening and the single‑scene scope holds. The on‑page cost is subtle rather than sharply dramatized, keeping this short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clear within the first lines (who/where/why), and the structure holds a clean single‑scene arc with one descent/return transition. Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure builds via whalesong, the tile’s symbols, and memory influx toward a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands as Clara’s stance shift and talisman choice; the cost is subtle but legible. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid drive holds: situational pressure from the storm narrows options while a causal decision (pressing fragments) effects the escape. Orientation is clean early; the piece stays single‑scene with one clear tightening. Closure lands on the page with cost (letting go; shattering anchors), and the final image reweights the premise. A touch of convenience remains in how neatly the storm resolves the bind, though it’s pre‑set and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean single-scene causal chain: hiding → confrontation → reveal dummy → negotiation → exchange for asylum. Orientation is solid, and closure lands via a decisive trade. However, the pivotal negotiation is summarized (“For the next hour… She traded the scroll… and a promise”), softening on-page cost and testing plausibility. The causal lens holds, but the off-stage deal mutes the climax’s force.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset; the piece holds a single scene with a small coda. The inferred drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, and the closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration when the hum syncs with breath and the ritual accrues meaning. Cost is soft but legible as surrender/expenditure of self into the practice. The “days that followed” summary slightly diffuses the immediate cadence but maintains the established pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: fragments → storm → locket realization, culminating in a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is fast and clean (port, container labyrinth, tide clock), and the rhythm tightens through the storm. Closure lands with conceptual cost (identity reconfigured; a new hunt begins). Mild structural softness: the locket discovery resolves the core question via coincidence rather than pressure he creates.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sound density builds (shell hum → merged tone → rattling glass) to a cadence break at silence and the 12:00 stasis. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing—the riddle becomes harmony felt rather than solved—tied to on‑page phenomena (spinning dials, glowing note). Orientation is clear early; single scene coherence is strong. The cost is legible but modest, limiting the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: symbol spotted → plan articulated → week of execution → Council confrontation → strategic refusal that holds the line for now. Orientation is solid early, and the one‑week montage reads as a purposeful transition. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise under a Situational lens: the Council withdraws, the fight persists with a reweighted community stance. The cost is light (largely effort and future risk), keeping it out of the upper band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: a tight countdown to dawn and drones, climax on the dissolving grain, then a brief coda that reweights meaning. The accumulative lens holds; the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration where her act gains post-facto validation by the archivist. Cost is conceptual (meaning vs. automation) rather than material, but legible on the page. Orientation is crisp from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds cleanly: damaged drone → diagnostic via water → patch and recalibrate → test flight → ship ascends with drones. Orientation is crisp early; the basin method is taught and then paid off. Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Charged Poise: the ship departs; Lira recommits to the ongoing cost of the work. The cost is modest (labor/endurance rather than a hard trade‑off), keeping it short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (condensation, phrasebook, convergence) intensify toward the on-page discovery of light beneath ice and the conceptual repricing at the end. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and the shards cohere causally: falcon → map → trek → glow → shard → aftermath. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with visible cost (half-buried in snow, shard in hand) and a reconfigured stance toward maps. A minor neatness—the leap to “rivers…they’re alive” and “Maps are lies”—skates close to declaration, but the images substantiate it.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The pattern (tone → footsteps → structural alignment → communal return) tightens once into a cadence shift when mechanisms revive (clock, fountain, bell) and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration as Kael departs. Closure lands on the page through the final strike and departure, though the cost is modest. Orientation is clean throughout; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single continuous scene with clear anchors builds to a resonant reconfiguration: she places the vial, unsnarls the hush, releases the vault, and departs. The causal chain holds (temple → fissure → chamber → pedestal → activation), with a clean cadence shift at the unsnarling. Cost is conceptual (forfeiting captured legacy) more than concrete but legible in the final stance. Accumulative/textural lens is sustained to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, motifs (lattice, copperlight, scuffs) coherently build to a Resonant Reconfiguration: “I’m not running. I’m writing.” Orientation is established early (Elias, lighthouse prison, reef), and the closure image reweights the premise (authorship over inheritance). Cost is implied (risk of drowning in hush, foreclosing the father’s path) rather than sharply dramatized, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation lands early (who, where, when) and the causal chain is clean: bead to fruit to hum to release. Closure is on-page with a decisive change (night fractures into dawn; both are freed). Cost is felt conceptually more than viscerally; centuries of captivity and the paradox of freeing a betrayer do the work. The hybrid causal/lyric drive holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: threads, corridors, and motifs layer toward a tangible restoration. Closure lands on the page with the merged plates and the labyrinth’s “recognition,” plus the emptied plates as a conceptual price. Causal clarity is clean at the micro level, though turns are gentle and largely unopposed. Orientation is swift and stable, and the final cadence reweights the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: discovery → placement → patient rebuild → activation → stance crystallization. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (she embraces faith as choice), with on‑page image (glow, villagers arriving). Causality is coherent, though the cost is more implied (time, surrender) than dramatized. Orientation is clear early, and the single arc remains tight.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: decode margin → carrier/letter → margin message → fountain test → hidden chip → hologram revelation → new mission. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; prop states and world rules stay coherent. Closure is on‑page (conceptual repricing toward a mission), though cost is soft. The chain never stalls, but the final beat explains its epiphany a touch.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single‑scene, Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues (coup imminent, telescopes moved) to a Conceptual Repricing when the flame “synchronizes” the chart. Orientation is clean early; motifs set up pay off in the visual reconfiguration. The closure lands as a charged realization (“the chart changing”), but the cost remains mostly implied rather than concretely paid on the page. Causality holds, though escalation is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density rises from entry to invocation to condensation‑letters, then resolves in a cadence shift at dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she accepts carrying the unsent letters forward; the shard’s edges smoothing marks cost and after/before. Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when clear), no causality breaks. Stakes are modest but tightly executed for a single‑scene lyric.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: motifs (coral/cast/mist) accrete toward a Conceptual Repricing and a brief Charged Poise at the negotiating table. Closure lands on-page when she places the coral and reframes the talks: “This grew from ruin.” Cost is felt as risk and revaluation of her role. A slight orientation wobble (“after the anesthetic kicks in”) is unexplained but does not undercut closure.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the found fragment → curated display → communal ignition → reconfigured stance. Orientation is clean and the closure is a resonant reconfiguration (from requiem to resurrection), with a felt vulnerability cost. The “exposed film” concept reframes the action at the turn and is paid off at closure. Pressure is gentle but coherent; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural; pattern density increases (hum → shimmer → dancers → flapper → lullaby) and reweights the stake from technical experiment to personal awakening. Causal links are clean: aligning frequencies + nickel’s surface = mural memory. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with the “next pause” charged as a chosen posture. The cost is primarily conceptual (forsaking certainty), which is felt but not deeply dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.6)
    Clean causal chain: approach → test → initiation → execution → public signal. Orientation is crisp and the two-shard structure (greenhouse → garden) is legible. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration: the clandestine language becomes a public beacon. However, the cost of exposure is gestured at rather than felt on the page, softening the close under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the postcard’s arrival, the shell’s migration, bloom → seed → singing form a coherent density‑building pattern toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on the page with the seed/tree and Lira’s song; the cost is the relinquishment of insomnia-as-armor and the reweighting of her practice. Causality is softly magical but consistent and legible. One scene-window with a single transition holds together cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from the storm-damaged tube to the director’s “cannot be repaired” edict to Lirael’s pivot into song. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: preservation as evolution; the before/after is legible in the new harmony and orchids’ response. Stakes (dormant feelings possibly unbound) are engaged on the page, not merely declared. The cost is implied rather than cashed fully, but the charged final image earns it at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning causal: research choices lead to discoveries; Henrik’s challenge and key prompt a decisive turn; translation of the sister dialogue reframes options and culminates in the call. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. Closure reads as a charged poise/earned step—the phone call—carrying felt cost (risking rejection before the wedding). The convenience of the perfect manuscript is visible but does not undercut the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene accumulative design is clear, with orientation locked early and a steady build toward decoding. Closure lands on-page when she reads the note; the cost is mostly conceptual/emotional rather than materially felt. The “breathing” cadence provides the tightening, but options never meaningfully narrow. Still, the pattern completes coherently with a functional Resonant Reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: note → song → ledger → dream → skylight pattern → decision to seek Voss. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with Charged Poise—he shifts from courier to heir and leaves, accepting risk and abandoning client obligations. Orientation is clear early and the throughline stays coherent. The cost is implicit rather than dramatized in consequence, but legible.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern of prisms, grain, and codes coheres to a charged closure: writing a new code summons a door, she steps through, and refuses to look back. Orientation is clean from the outset; the terrace and cornfield are legible and consistent. The cost registers as a relinquishment of the terrace and the search itself. Causality is poetic but traceable: observation → decoding → authored code → threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: signals (waiting/ritual), build (first flickers), crest (alignment at pre‑sunrise), and soft settle. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph (who/where/what). Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive turn; cost is implied (loneliness/endurance in a decaying city) rather than explicit. The structure is clean but avoids sharper causal tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is immediate and clean; single‑POV focus holds through one coherent progression (shard → seeds → pool). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal links, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the pool. Closure lands on the page with images that reweight the premise. Cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it short of elite.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.6)
    Single‑scene accumulative design holds: observation → discordant slash → crowd coalesces → charged silence → release. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration where the arcade’s rhythm is retuned and publicly confirmed. The because/therefore chain is legible, but the cost at closure is conceptual rather than felt, muting impact. Lens clarity is steady; a more explicit price at the final beat would lift this.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density and cadence mount through dance → adhesion of dust → burning inscription → garden’s tremor → quiet resolve. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she takes the verse at cost, doesn’t topple the ban, and claims elective exile. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; cause and consequence are legible within the chosen mode. The price (pain, risk of madness, ongoing exile) sits on the page at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the scene coheres as one continuous ritual that culminates in a small reweighting (the notebook line). Closure lands as a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing, yet the felt cost is faint, limiting impact. The “before everything shifted” clock is invoked but not dramatized into structural pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds via object returns (box → hourglass → dawn) to a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, and the beats link through focused ritual rather than plot turns. Closure lands on the page with the hourglass’s reprise and “I hear you,” with cost in accepting non-punishment. Slight neatness in the arc keeps it shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the scene coheres as patterns and responses intensify toward a conceptual repricing—realizing the grotto as a crossroads and her balloons as bridges. Orientation is crisp early; props and space track. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the gauge reweighted from altitude to coordinate. Cost is conceptual (accepting ongoing responsibility and uncertain labor) rather than sharply dramatized, keeping it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single‑scene, accumulative/textural build is clean: entrance → discovery → groan → renunciation → charged reveal. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration with cost (sacrificing the negative) and the rule‑set reweighted by the locket/whisper. The ivy‑parting alcove verges on convenient but fits the taught “living architecture” logic. Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sonic ritual layers until the bells trigger a cadence shift and the piece lands in a Charged Poise—mirrors unchanged yet possibilities seeded elsewhere. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when) and the throughline remains single‑scene. The final beat carries conceptual cost (she spends herself for an effect she cannot witness) and a visible price (fatigue, falter under bells). Stakes narrow as mirrors resist and the clock hits; closure is quiet but legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Situational with a mild accumulative cadence; pressure coheres from dawn to dusk amid negotiations. Closure lands on-page with signatures and a Charged Poise final image (imperfect treaty, felt price of concession). Orientation is clean early, and the day’s arc provides a single tightening (softening → decisive guidance → signing). Cost is legible in the “relief and regret,” ambiguous language, and the acceptance of flawed peace.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images (egg, cracks, thunder) intensify toward a closure where the act becomes a ritual of loss. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: he accepts preserving only an echo while the storm erases the tangible. Cost is legible on the page (the egg and last river water forfeited, choice not to check). Orientation is anchored early; the mansion coda pays off rather than resets.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: tension gathers via the dance’s intensifying cadence until the door opens and echoes manifest. Closure lands on‑page (door opens; she departs carrying echoes), functioning as a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the outset and the single scene stays coherent. The cost at closure is more implied than legible, keeping it below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.0)
    Single-scene arc is clean: setup of purpose, trial with skeptical audience, tightening via challenge, and a reconfiguration through reversal. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural; the cadence shift when the audience moves from unease to release provides closure. Cost is lighter (conceptual acceptance of half-truths plus public risk) but present on the page. Orientation is crisp from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single-scene accumulative build is clear and oriented from the outset; the cadence culminates in the monarch’s landing and a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis closure. The felt cost is the work’s ephemerality (the lattice dissolving by morning) and the long wait condensed into this moment. Causality is modest but coherent: weaving → beacon → monarch contact → reconfiguration of meaning. The ending’s repricing lands without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the causal chain holds: card → braid reconfiguration → illumination → auroral vortex → apparition → charged names. The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he achieves a new way to preserve memory with felt cost and a reweighted world image. Minor softness remains in how smoothly the ritual succeeds (little resistance beyond effort), which trims the sense of paid price. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal spine and is held to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the storm, seal, hologram, and dream imagery build toward a conceptual repricing: transcendence as integration. Orientation is crisp early (bunker, storm, directive) and the single scene coheres. Closure lands with a before/after (seeker → architect) but the cost is implied rather than materially felt. The sequence is cohesive without teleports or dropped set‑ups.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal chain is clean: decode numbers → key tile in groove → chamber opens → second tile aligns → merger triggers repricing of “covenant.” Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a felt, if quiet, cost: relinquishing external certainties for a self-bound covenant. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the single-scene window holds. The cost could read sharper in the final image, but the on-page choice (“I’ll honor it”) seals the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative lens holds: the ritual repeats with increasing constraint (limited extract, reality’s warp ending), culminating in Kael’s shift. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: Lirael spends the last drop, Kael accepts, and reality snaps back with an admitted limit on permanence. Orientation is solid early, and causal beats are clean. The cost is present but modestly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the ritual assembly, synchronized breathing, and mirror hum build to a conceptual turn when the sextant points inward. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (“not to be erased, but to be navigated”) with a charged final intention. Orientation is crisp from the outset; causal steps are coherent. The on‑page cost is subtle rather than felt, keeping it below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: the ritual repair culminates in the orchard blooming, yielding a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure is on‑page and legible; the before/after is clear. Cost is light (no tangible sacrifice beyond endurance), so the decisive feel is muted. Orientation is strong from the start (who/where/why).

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: letter → orchard clues → grotto vision → cameo map → tree fusion. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis—she chooses to inherit by fusing the cameo, foreclosing institutional obedience. Orientation is lucid from the opening. The price is implied (career, sanity risk), not dramatized, but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: Kael’s disappearance → diary/key realization → guardian’s test → decoding “Silence” → entry and reunion. Closure lands with a decisive change (access gained) and a conceptual cost (admitting ignorance), on the page. Orientation is firm early, and the single scene tracks without resets. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but it’s legible and tied to her flaw.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Causal. Beats link cleanly—journal clue → tune at the calliope → hidden door → seed + card → garden—culminating in a Decisive Change (they step into the meadow; the ship vanishes) with a touch of Conceptual Repricing (“the garden isn’t a place—it’s a choice”). Orientation is strong from the opening image. The cost at closure is soft, more conceptual than felt, keeping this out of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under a Causal lens, the beats link cleanly: symbols → rope pattern → seal → door opens → chamber → scroll reframes meaning → return. Orientation is immediate and stable; the one transition to the chamber is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of role and world-rules, but the on-page cost is modest. No glaring set-up is left unkept, though the return snaps back neatly.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is immediate and legible; the scene advances cleanly from examination → activation → conjuration → settling. Closure lands on the page via a resonant reconfiguration: the noise is reweighted into a sustainable quiet, not erased, with the bloom installed. The dominant drive lens reads Hybrid with an Accumulative/Textural dominance (pattern intensifies, then cadences into hush) supported by causal beats. Cost is present but subdued; nonetheless, the on‑page before/after is unmistakable.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is crisp early (custodian in a ruined glass pavilion after collapse). The causal chain holds: research and alignment attempts → storm/moonlight opportunity → decisive placement of the shard → pavilion activation; coincidence (the moon flicker) complicates but Elara’s preparatory work earns the turn. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change and a quiet Conceptual Repricing (the prism’s true purpose), with a felt cost (partial return, years of labor). Structure is one continuous arc with clean escalation toward the seventh‑night climax.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; pressure accrues via hush, hum, and fracturing fog until a cadence shift at the final crack. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: she redefines her role from recorder to participant, with cost signaled by letting the rain’s memory evaporate and deferring archival duty. Orientation is clean and the pattern holds. The cost is subtle rather than sharp, keeping it just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pattern of light, chant, and sensory filtering thickens to the lilies’ bloom and a conceptual repricing of “shadows.” Orientation is crisp early (who/where/when). Closure lands as a reconfiguration rather than a decisive external turn, with cost implied in owning prior failure and embracing risk. Causal throughline (mosaic note → chamber → ignition) holds without contradictions.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear orientation early, one continuous scene, and a coherent Accumulative/Textural drive. The closure lands as a Charged Poise: the tide turns, Kael softens, and Elara commits to an indirect, time‑costly path. Cost is the acceptance of deferral rather than resolution, made tangible by leaving the cicada for the tide. Causal links are light but consistent with the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.6)
    Orientation is clean early (bunker, inversion clock, trellis), and the causal spine holds: countdown → ascent → loss → return → sprout/realization. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with legible cost (the doll gone) and a new stance. The hybrid lens (causal actions with an accumulative lyric payoff) remains stable through the ending. The sprout image reweights the premise without mechanical tidy-up.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds a patterned hush toward a Conceptual Repricing—silence reframed as presence—which reweights the premise. Orientation is clean and single‑scene coherent; the closure is on‑page (raising the vial, choosing new routes), though the cost is subtle. Causality holds via the storm glass mechanics and the midnight transition, with a single decisive intensification (the vial’s stilling).

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clear because/therefore sequencing: shard → murals → keyhole → stair → guardian → identity reveal. Closure is a conceptual repricing: the “throne” becomes legacy/self‑recognition, with a felt foreclosure (stairway collapses; she refuses the literal seat). Orientation is clean, single‑POV, and time pressure is integrated. Cost is present but more conceptual than material, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational drive holds: the knock brings Kael, the threshold is tested, and the crossing reconfigures options with cost (sanctuary shudders, risk acknowledged). Orientation is clear early; the single scene tightens decisively at the crossing. The ending’s Charged Poise—hands joined, threshold pulsing—lands a before/after without mechanical wrap‑up. The causal chain is simple but clean and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: pressure rises → diamonds destabilize → device prompts → choice to turn bolt → farm stabilizes with a conceptual reprice. Orientation is crisp early, and the decisive change is on the page. The “Turn it” instruction borders on convenient, but it’s pre‑seeded by the device and bolt resonance. Cost reads more as reweighting than consequence, trimming peak impact.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under a primarily Causal lens, the beats link cleanly: crank → hum → vision → mechanism → letters → reframed legacy. Closure lands on the page as a Conceptual Repricing with a concrete act (unlocking) and a clear before/after. The cost is mostly emotional and conceptual (accepting chosen erasure), which reads but isn’t searing. A touch of convenience in the vision directly revealing the mechanism keeps it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture; each act (“unsnap,” descend, shatter) triggers the next turn (stage opens, chamber, reality reconfigures). Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: he abandons capture for lived pattern; the greenhouse’s collapse and changed inscription make a before/after legible. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; single POV holds. The cost is present but more implied than dramatized, keeping this shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observation → object discovery → date revelation → conceptual reweighting → new folder. Orientation is clean from the first lines (who/where/when). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—he commits to documenting despite uncertainty—with a light but legible cost (choosing work over definitive answers). Stakes remain quiet yet coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.4)
    Strong causal chain: puddle-map → tunnel → terminal → copy → alarms → escape → distribution. Orientation is clean early (auric lagoon, mangroves, drones), and the decisive change (securing the files; station destroyed) lands with cost. A slight convenience haze around the station exploding after success doesn’t undercut the throughline. Closure functions as a decisive change with an earned final image.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sound/silence density and a cadence shift as the figure emerges and the atrium flares. Orientation is strong from the opening; single scene coherence holds. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he expends breath to drown the code, the figure dissolves, and he accepts a provisional peace with cost. The causal thread (music as negative-space tactic → figure frays → temporary hush) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is strong from the outset (single POV, clear place and goal) and the causal chain is legible: dust → prod → monuments → readable leaves → decision. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: folklore is validated and options reweighted toward action. Cost is light—no real risk or sacrifice beyond the dust’s dissolution—so the ending feels poised more than paid. Lens: Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural holds cleanly through to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine (storm → hatch → greenhouse → fall → retrieval) culminating in a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands: the compass reweights from navigation to mirror, and he alters future tactics. Coincidence initiates but does not resolve, which is acceptable at this scale. Stakes remain modest and the physical jeopardy resolves quickly, limiting the cadence of tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is clean: coin → vortex → apparition → farewell → extinguished glow. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: he loses the coin and accepts Lira’s shedding of her name with felt cost. Orientation is crisp from the outset and the scene holds to one window. Slight ease in the ritual’s success is the only soft spot.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece tightens from journey to encounter to reweighted end-image; the closure is a Conceptual Repricing (truth as tooth; laughter as felt warmth). Orientation is clean and the harp’s pattern break marks the turn. Cost is emotional more than situational, but it lands on the page with her admission and renunciation of a harsher stance.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: environmental intensification (hum, spores, flare) and the visitor’s pressure coalesce into a Charged Poise closure. The before/after is legible: from searching for an equation to embracing endurance with cost (burning spores, facing invasive stimuli). Orientation is clear early; single scene, single POV; closure lands on the page without hand‑waving. Stakes stay focused and resolve coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: mission → ink → hyper-vision → mural → tracing → unfastening → return. Closure works as a resonant reconfiguration: retrieving and then relinquishing reweights “anchors of intuition” toward letting go. Cost is conceptual more than visceral, but legible on the page. Orientation is strong and the single-scene arc holds under a hybrid, textural-leaning lens.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid tending Accumulative/Textural: investigation layers to a hollow sound, hidden compartment, documentary proof, and a conceptual reweighting of the elevator’s “malfunction.” Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—he commits to repairing stories, not just machinery—backed by the ghost’s thank‑you. The cost is soft but on‑page (accepting the burden; physical tremor; altered mission). Orientation is clean early; the throughline holds without causality gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the anomaly → engraved plate → press rhythm → whisper shatters → transformation progression is coherent and escalatory. Orientation is swift and clean; stakes are enacted on the page rather than declared. Closure lands with clear cost and a decisive before/after reconfiguration of the library and patrons. The causal chain is stylized but legible, with no soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal spine: plan → storm → vision/fungal proof → heresy → public doubt and reweighting of the shard. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (heretic status, institutional backlash) and a concrete final image. The “weeks” summary compresses conflict but maintains continuity and stakes. Drive lens reads Hybrid leaning Causal, held through the end.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal progression: chamber setup → diagnostic tethering → Lira’s admission → stone flares → reconfigured melody. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—truth replaces denial—with the cost embodied in Lira’s on‑page admission. Orientation is crisp from the outset; the single‑scene window holds. The rules (stone thrives with truth) are honored and enacted without late cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: compass → tunnel → lagoon → presence → repriced aim. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis: she accepts the absence of answers and withdraws with charged artifacts. Cost is conceptual and mildly somatic rather than materially consequential, but legible (“some mysteries are meant to stay unsolved”). Orientation and scene continuity are clean.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear causal chain: discovery → activation → encounter → repricing of role → return. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing where Lira reframes the island and her vocation, with the slide and sculptures reweighted. Cost is understated, more implied duty than on-page loss. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; lens reads Hybrid favoring causal beats.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural design coheres: postcards → window study → inscription → mural shift → cataloging → reweighted understanding. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing (communion with the hush) with a charged final promise (“final layer… unbroken”). Causality is clean, orientation is early, and the “map to the hush” through light changes is well‑threaded. The cost at closure is soft but present as ongoing, chosen obsession.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.9)
    Dominant lens: Causal. Because/therefore linkages are consistent (diary → lagoon → parley → tunnels → codex/traitor → trap). Closure lands with cost: codex lost, diary blank, only time bought. Slight convenience undermines peak pressure—the villain’s sudden appearance and quick trapdoor resolution feel engineered.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: detail density increases to a cadence shift when lanterns brighten and the bottle reframes from barrier to lens. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the single POV holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—revival via memory—though the on‑page price remains conceptual more than dramatized. The weeks‑passing montage is efficient and doesn’t break the scene’s continuity.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates via pattern density—foghorn silence, shriek, hidden hum—toward a conceptual repricing: the prophecy reframed as awakening rather than disaster. Orientation is clear early and the closure lands in a charged poise: he commits to archive and listen. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping it shy of peak scores.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive with a causal backbone: egg hatches → ritual → vortex transit → sapling. Orientation is crisp early, and closure lands on the page with a before/after image. The cost reads mostly conceptual (sacrificed seeds; risk borne), not strongly felt, which trims impact. Still, the arc is coherent and the decisive turn is earned by prior setup.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is clean: glue dampens tone → she switches mechanisms → storms agitate → she modulates rhythm to restore balance. Orientation anchors early and holds; escalation and resolution occur on the page with a resonant reconfiguration. The cost is conceptual (recognition of influence/responsibility) and minor physical (exertion), which keeps stakes intimate rather than dire. Closure lands with a before/after in the sanctuary’s state and Lira’s stance.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density builds from station hush → pursuit → crater → return. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration in the speck-of-stardust reveal and Veyra’s softened stance; the cost (missed report; lantern dimmed) is on the page. Orientation is clean from the opening. The single tightening beat (the star’s death and her choice to witness) suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: images and rituals accrete until the glow and the gathered ghosts demand a turn. Closure lands on the page with cost via the spoken release and the box’s shattering (Decisive Change with a resonant reconfiguration of the covenant). Causality is mythic but coherent: attention → revelation → imperative → speech → release. The “Speak” cue is a little neat, but the earned cadence mitigates it.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: object-handling and description function as keys, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where time becomes a “mosaic.” The causal micro-turn—placing the fragment, mercury stilling, vision of the wife—lands on the page with cost (relinquishing the talisman). Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the single-scene window stays coherent. The off-page restoration of numbers skirts summary but doesn’t undercut the on-page closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is clear and held: storm debris → tending → tapestry → acceptance of impermanence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: she values the process over permanence with the cost of inevitable unraveling made explicit. Orientation is clean early; single-scene day arc is coherent. Stakes are quiet but the final reweighting is on-page and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: the build of copper/wire/root density culminates in the dusk linkage and RR, with the visible cost of time/life. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the time skips are purposeful and legible. The climax (wire meets stone; spirit appears) is an on‑page reconfiguration that reweights all prior beats. The ending’s stasis is earned and the price is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens (causal steps toward an accumulative, conceptual turn) holds: footprints → guide → amber placement → resonance → reweighting. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: the meaning shifts from bottled chemistry to convergence/mirroring, with a felt cost. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; single scene coherence is strong. A minor softness remains in external stakes, but the internal cost anchors the end.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details (bird dialects, seed work, storm) build toward a Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean from the first lines; the single scene coheres. Closure lands in the final glance back—flowers flickering, storm advancing, “The earth remembers”—with a felt commitment to ongoing cost. The cost is subtle (time, hostile environment) rather than decisive, tempering the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the sequence of riddles builds a patterned density toward a communal cadence shift at dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: the community’s currency of distance is reframed into connection, sealed by the “love” riddle and the leaf’s display. Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught early (cylinders, grooves, communal gathering). The cost is implied rather than felt—more conceptual than dramatized—keeping it below elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: ritual → sustained glimpse → apparition → loss → reweighted choice. Orientation is clean from the outset and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a tangible act (choosing a path through a live door). The cost is conceptual but present: he forecloses his prior stance of hesitation. Causal threads (shutdown reactors → glimpse persistence) are consistent enough without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.9)
    Clean Causal lens: swapping pieces produces escalating responses (groan → whine → violent shake), culminating in the king swap that restores the sky. Orientation is crisp; single scene, single POV, one dominant stake. Closure lands on the page with a decisive change, but the cost is light—no sacrifice or loss is felt at the end. The “king with impossible sundial” is a neat causal keystone, though the instant fix reads slightly easy.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is clean early; pattern and ritual teach themselves and pay off when the king topples and “unbind” reverses, producing an on‑page reconfiguration. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with a slight RR: the board and self redefined; the cost is more conceptual than visceral but legible. A hair more concrete jeopardy or consequence at the end would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clear causal chain: pain/avoidance → feather seeding → vision/cavern → quake → transformation/shattering → return with cost and reweighted meaning. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph, and the two‑shard structure (bookstore → cavern → return) stays coherent. Closure lands as Decisive Change with persistent price (stone gone; shards in skin). Minor convenience in the mother’s exposition doesn’t break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal chain: decoding the tapestry → memory confrontation → revealed path → pedestal activation → village unfreezes. Closure is on the page with a Decisive Change (time resumes) and a conceptual repricing of guilt; the drive lens reads Causal throughout. The magic’s mechanics are legible and seeded, though success arrives without a hard setback. Stakes remain coherent and focused in a single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid drive: causal beats (painting “Forgive” → canyon shudder → spire refracts → ritual breaks) culminate in a conceptual repricing (“forgiveness” as relinquishing control). Closure lands on the page with a before/after image (gray ritual vs. refracted light) and a tangible social price implied. Orientation is crisp and single‑scene focus holds. The cost could bite harder in the final beat to reach elite range.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure and meaning build through motif recursion (charm, gears, acid, “between breaths”) to a clear RR/CR. Closure lands on the page with cost—the respirator removal and lung burn—reweighting the premise (“promise,” not “key”). Orientation is strong early, and setup → payoff linkages read coherent. The statue’s voice threads as an internalized counterforce without breaking causality.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece coheres around motif density (mirror, shell, water, light) leading to a resonant reconfiguration at the pool. Orientation is crisp, and the wrong-turn-to-oasis sequence creates a legible before/after. The closure cost is modest but on-page: he risks the caves and accepts the world’s cracks while choosing a different practice (drawing the cave). The chain is clean even if the external stakes stay low.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: scent, hum, cork, dawn, and rain build to the village’s felt response. Orientation is crisp early and causality is clean; the lantern interruption is a single, functional tightening. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “The proof was in the silence,” with a conceptual price of vulnerable self‑exposure. The felt cost is subtle rather than stark, keeping it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the midnight calls and build steps layer into a coherent progression that culminates in the noon hum and final midnight sanction (“Now navigate”). Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: the signals reweight reality, ghosts/routes answer, options expand. Orientation is solid early, and props/rules are carried through. The cost is primarily emotional and labor-based, modest but legible for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning causal: storm pressure → encounter with Jorn → move to hut → deploy the eye → ledger reveal → stance crystallization (“We occlude”). Closure lands as Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: choosing a strategy of truth-as-occlusion with implied risk to her hard-won safety. Orientation is clean and the single transition is motivated. The cost is mostly implied rather than felt on-page, which limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clean causal chain: boutonnière → encounter → hatch/trunk → written confession → vow. Single-PoV, two-shard scene holds cohesion; orientation is early and firm. Closure lands as a charged poise—he commits to returning memories, accepting cost—though the price is mostly projected rather than paid on-page. The drive lens reads Causal with a quiet, credible cadence shift at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: map → ants → cavern → chip → vision → reframed choice → return. Orientation is established early (who/where/why), and the single transition (vision garden) is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she reinterprets the “doorway of decisions” and alters stance. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional; it lands but remains modest.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.0)
    Situational lens: a sustained pressure (warning → climb → encounter) forces a stance crystallization. Closure arrives as a charged poise/CR: she understands the bleeding and chooses to leave, foreclosing denial. Orientation is clean and the scene holds together without teleports or resets. Cost is present but modest, more conceptual than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Causal. Orientation is immediate; the ledger reveal causes a reframed tactic, leading to the decisive act and stabilization—an on‑page Decisive Change with a conceptual repricing. Cost is implied (risk, prior losses, surrender of control) but the success comes quickly once she pivots, keeping the price felt but not biting. The structure stays within a single pressured scene and closes cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grave → scroll/map → climb → cave/blank scroll → repricing. Orientation is clean from the start, with a single POV and one transition that stays coherent. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing; the cost is felt in exertion and the relinquishing of envy. The ritual’s convenience skirts contrivance but doesn’t break the chain.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: details accrue (fog, gears, engraving, photo) toward a resonant reconfiguration when she links the screw to Eleanor and returns it with a note. Closure lands as a quiet CR/RR rather than a decisive act, with a legible before/after in her stance. Orientation is clear early, and the single‑scene scope fits. Cost remains soft, tempering the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.5)
    The causal chain is clean: preparation → carving under stress → crystallization → shudder → flare → path revealed and stance shift. Closure arrives with a decisive change (rune succeeds; scars reconfigure; path opens) plus a resonant repricing of his scars. Cost is present but light (real risk of self‑harm; scars persist rather than vanish), which modestly limits the impact. Orientation and scope remain tight and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (archive, hush before cutting, Clara summoned), and causal beats link cleanly: summons → bottle tactic → music → voice → finish. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with a concrete price (the emptied bottle) and a situational cost cue (chainsaws roar). The hybrid lens holds: causal action yields a charged final image rather than a tidy fix. No dangling setups; the napkin message, piano, and orchard all pay off.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece escalates through patterned discovery (shifting shelves → mural figures → inward cosmos) and lands a conceptual repricing: “spiral arbitration” reframed as internal conflict with a calm after. Closure is on‑page and coherent, but the price is conceptual rather than felt; few options are foreclosed beyond adopting a new understanding. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the backward counting builds density, then the underwater clock reveal and the key’s vibration deliver an on‑page conceptual turn. Orientation is crisp early; the single scene tightens cleanly. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing with a felt emotional price, though the cost is soft. The causal thread (counting → perception shift → reveal) is clear and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean Causal drive: analysis → invitation → reveal of a dying core → retuned method → systemic change. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (barriers dissolve/reconfigure) and a Conceptual Repricing (permeability reframed as strength). Cost is mostly conceptual (relinquishing control; inviting risk) rather than felt as a loss, slightly softening impact. Orientation is crisp from the first lines and the single scene holds.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Causal. Clues → hidden stair → subway car → fork → choice → return; each beat links via motivated because/therefore. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (contradictions as mirrors) with a felt emotional price. Some convenience (Greer’s disappearance, automatic car motion) softens pressure but doesn’t break coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive: a night of misdials steadily coheres into a pattern that reweights meaning at closure. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the mosaic of calls is legible and linked by Mara’s decisions with the disc. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she lets the disc spin, enshrining her role—though the cost is more conceptual than dramatized. The thread holds, but the climax’s price is gentle rather than undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when). The accumulative/textural lens holds: motifs (ink, locket, small acts) build to a Conceptual Repricing/Earned Stasis in the final realization that the covenant’s weight is in the now. Closure lands as a charged poise rather than a decisive act, with a felt price of sustained attention. The cost is nuanced rather than sharp, but legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clear causal spine: rumor → meeting → placement of moon rock → manifestation → conceptual reframing. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: loneliness recoded as “language,” and Elias’s felt change plus the surrendered rock provide cost. The Hybrid drive leans Accumulative at the end and holds. Minor softness: the negotiation’s success feels easy, with little narrowing of options before the ghost appears.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid with a dominant causal spine: the cosmic pause enables dowsing; tree→river→dig→map→stillpoint flows as because/therefore. Orientation is swift and clean, and the single POV holds. Closure lands on the page with the stillpoint encounter (RR/DC blend), with the “pause ending” tightening pressure before the final push. The cost is modest but legible (loss of the auditory guide; long, draining trek).

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.5)
    Coherent causal chain: blight from edits → anomaly response → pen as listening device → stance shift → decision to confess. Closure lands as a decisive change in tactics and identity, with a conceptual price (relinquishing control) and implied social cost (facing the farmer). Orientation is clean and the two-shard move to the house is tidy. Slight neatness in the mentor-facilitated turn keeps it below elite.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece builds coherently from solitary listening to communal music, then to a charged quiet at dawn. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the town’s silence is revalued, and Kael’s small sadness marks cost. Orientation is clean from the opening; single scene continuity holds. The only limitation is a relatively low‑risk path—no stringent constraint forces a hard trade‑off.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the patterned acts of art across rooms build toward a conceptual repricing: the archive as garden, vandalism as tending. Orientation is clean early and held, and the ending’s image (the healing tear revealing the grandmother) provides on-page closure. Cost is primarily emotional and conceptual, but legible. The chain of clues coheres without causal gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sensory/vibrational density builds to a cadence shift (joint drumming) that reweights the dominant stake. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Eli repositions the entanglement and commits to sustaining it. The causality is coherent, but cost is modest and primarily conceptual/emotional. The mid‑story pronoun shift introduces minor structural noise without breaking the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.9)
    Single‑scene coherence holds: storm → challenge → key/Libra → hidden stair → surveillance chamber → dawn image. The reveal of the maps functions as a conceptual turn, reweighting the premise (the labyrinth watches) for a CR‑style closure. Cost is implied (risk in the storm, “long way” endurance) rather than sharpened on‑page, which limits impact. Causal links are clean; no major teleports or resets.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.7)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues pressure through pattern‑making and a soft cadence shift as the canal’s “ache” eases; the final lingering patterns form a quiet Charged Poise closure. Orientation is clean and single‑scene. Cost is implied (ongoing, solitary tending) rather than sharply felt, so the landing is resonant but modest.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through the grotto’s charged quiet, the father reveal, and the overnight games, tightening to a Charged Poise closure in Lila’s resolve to “keep planting.” Orientation is clear early, and the single scene holds. Closure lands in the shared decision to continue, with the displays recontextualized as rebellion and mentorship. The cost is modest but legible in Lila’s repeated losses and Clara’s exposure of a private bond.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens leaning causal: whale call → swim → relinquish scrimshaw → island dissolves → identity reconfigured. Orientation is clear by the first paragraph, and set‑ups (scrimshaw, legends, disappearing island) pay off on the page. Closure lands with cost (home and talisman surrendered), and consequences alter future options. The whale’s arrival is a mythic coincidence, but it coheres with the established world.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the stepwise spoon‑making densifies pressure and culminates in a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—she commits to continued carving despite the mandate’s cost. Orientation is crisp from the outset; causality is quiet but coherent. The mandate’s price (family taken) is concrete, and the final vow reframes creation as defiance with an ongoing risk. The closure lands cleanly without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: sound/light density builds to a charged poise ending. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration when she stands on “liquid glass” and recognizes the colonnade as threshold. Orientation is crisp early; beats connect via sensed intensification rather than causal reversals. Cost is mostly conceptual, not materially priced, keeping this just shy of higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid lens holds: trade → experimentation → revelation → exchange/renunciation forms a tight because/therefore chain while accumulating sensory density to closure. The closure lands as a decisive reorientation (he renounces the reed tongue, breaks his vow about pigments, and reframes seeing) with a modest but real cost. Orientation is clear early; the two-shard structure (day/night) remains coherent. The reveal of Marla’s past fuels the final intensification rather than a soft reset.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.8)
    Structure is clean: lab setup → cave discovery → lab reprise, with a clear causal chain from questioning to activation to realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: the mountain has always been singing; engineering is secondary. The cost is subtle (a renunciation of device-centric control) rather than dramatized via loss or risk, keeping the turn quiet. Orientation is strong from the opening; the Hybrid drive leans accumulative at the end and holds.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: stencil → lanterns → discovery of living shadows → night of work → charged dawn and pendant. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—grief refracted rather than erased, capped by “Light the way.” Cost is legible (physical strain, relinquishing pages, emotional exposure), if modest. Orientation is clear early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain, tape, and card geometry build toward a conceptual repricing—“This is how we rebuild.” The closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration of survival into rebuilding, with the loft’s listening as the charged final image. Cost is present but conceptual (abandoning old frameworks, surrendering to pattern); not deeply dramatized as a sacrifice. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when), and the single-scene frame is coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: observed shifts (hum → glow → liquid light) reweight the central stake. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: not a tomb but a seed; she chooses deeper engagement at a cost (Kael’s exit, risk of “corruption”). Orientation is clean, single scene coherent. A touch more concrete consequence would lift further.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens: Hybrid leaning causal—investigation (because) leads to the word, which triggers the metamorphosis on the page. Closure lands: saying “Bloom” decisively changes the shadow and reconfigures the library (RR with DC flavor). Cost is mostly conceptual (risk of shattering hope) rather than embodied; still, the narrowing—pedestal gone, reliance on superimposition and a single word—feels coherent. Orientation is clear early, and the final image cleanly reweights prior details.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis with Conceptual Repricing). The final image (completed tail rippling at dawn) reweights the central stake and forecloses the path of self‑protective hardness. Cost is legible in the on‑page shedding—fear, guilt, betrayal—and the solitary, painstaking labor through the night. Orientation is clear from the outset, and the pattern holds.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is swift and clean (tower, dawn, hourglass); the rings create a coherent progression of memory scenes. The causal chain holds under an accumulative lens: touch ring → vision → heightened cost → deeper ring. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing (scars as readable stories) with on‑page cost (reliving the mother’s death). The altar condensation is brisk, but the hourglass shatter cleanly locks the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece layers charged objects and visions until a cadence shift reconfigures the premise (unused love is locatable and retrievable). Orientation is clean from the first lines; causality holds (touch → visions → identification → vow). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid—she commits to a path—yet the on‑page cost remains implied rather than felt. The single tightening (second reading deepens to names/history) is sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    Orientation and causality are clean: sextant alignment → hologram → traced star → portal → jar → vision → dawn. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: creativity reframed as “waiting,” with the charged final image of renewed pursuit. Cost is more experiential than consequential, but present in his surrender/drowning‑vastness beat. Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative/Textural holds without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: clock → guide’s terms → learning “occasionally everywhere” → decision at midnight → activation and dream. Orientation is strong early; single scene coherence holds. Closure is a decisive change and a resonant reconfiguration of the world’s possibility set, though the price paid is soft. The inferred lens is Causal with lyric texture; it holds through the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: patterning of hums and gears builds to a conceptual turn where the forest reconfigures as a brain. Closure lands on the page with cost: she sacrifices the heirloom gear (seed) to preserve the coexistence she values. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/goal) and the pedestal clearing serves as the hinge. Minor softness in causal pressure (events unfold smoothly) keeps it shy of elite tier.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs (star stamp, indirect routes, twilight) build toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis ending—returning to the dock to wait. Orientation is clean early, and the single journey shard coheres. Closure lands via conceptual repricing (courage as a shared river; the punch left behind), with a felt but quiet cost (renouncing destination, accepting indefinite watch). Pressure is modest yet coherent across the walk→clearing→return arc.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal chain is clean: neglected bolt → wobble/scream → voided hush → staircase insight → return/tighten/speak. Closure lands as a Decisive Change paired with a Conceptual Repricing of “safety,” on the page with the bench’s click and his line. The cost (breaking an unspoken contract) is legible but soft; consequences are sketched more in atmosphere than in concrete fallout. Structure stays within a single lens and scene window with one reflective detour that redirects action.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clear causal chain: deciphered messages → alignment → trapdoor → confrontation → sundered illusion. Closure occurs on the page with the pretender revealed and the realm reconfigured. The cost is conceptually present (upending a coronation, a realm reoriented) but feels light for the protagonist, limiting impact. The single-scene structure holds without confusion.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns (tapping, atlas, sensor anomalies, plankton coordinates) intensify to a cadence shift where meaning reconfigures and they decide to follow. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing: the ban “awakens” cyclical gateways, and they pay by abandoning the station and entering the storm. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single transition (dream to storm) supports build. Cost is legible on the page (risk, departure, empty station), not merely implied.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is swift and clean; the causal thread—hum grows, alignment nears, she mobilizes, activation—holds. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the rebellion re-animates on the page with a communal roar. Cost is more conceptual/social than material, but legible. The single-scene structure stays tight without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: kite → decoding with plants → digging → hatch → vault → embryo → planting. Orientation is strong from the opening and the single-scene frame is coherent. Closure lands with a Decisive Change and a conceptual repricing (future as seed, not weapon), though cost is modest (risk of drones, potential social backlash, physical strain). The drive lens (Causal) holds throughout without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: present-tense sensory anchors accrue to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate; stakes and scene are contained, and the gust-triggered flashback provides the key turn. Closure lands with cost—grief persists while options reweight toward resilient presence. The because/therefore is soft but coherent: trigger → grounding → stance crystallization.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure mounts from claustrophobic walls to the candlelit ascent and the web installation. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the reassembled threads and animated portrait reprice “fragmentation” into “reweaving.” Cost is on‑page via sacrifice and transgressive use of the cards/box; the lighthouse’s missing lens charges the final image. Orientation is clear from the outset; the single transition is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: drone crash → ink method → patterns/hologram → child’s reframing → journey → door opens. Closure lands as Charged Poise with Lira turning the handle and stepping inside; the cost is inferred risk of the tower’s trap and repeating her brother’s fate. Orientation is crisp from the start, and the piece holds a Causal lens consistently. The only softness is that on‑page cost remains conceptual rather than enacted.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a causal lens, the beats chain cleanly: contraband letter → archival crisis → activation → awakening → pact. Closure lands as a charged poise: they unite with the letter in hand, naming the cost (“The Council would come”). The cost is mostly projected rather than paid on the page, keeping the ending strong but not exceptional. Orientation is clear early, and scope remains within a single, coherent scene.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and acts (sand, knife, dome, scrap) accrue toward a Charged Poise ending. Closure lands when she plants the engraved scrap and whispers “Quiet,” conceptually repricing weight and silence. Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional (solitude, renunciation), not materially tested. Orientation is clear and the single-scene frame is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominance: patterned disturbance → tuned intervention → apparition → dissolution → restored order. Closure lands with cost on the page: the goddess dissolves into the soil as the constellations stabilize. Orientation is clean and the because/therefore chain holds tactically (spike strikes lead to shifts in pattern and access). The mechanism is fabulist but consistent and paid off in the final tone note.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal drive is clear: the call triggers investigation, the memo reconfigures knowledge, her handoff to the journalist leads to public fallout and a continued stance. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she forecloses family silence and accepts cost. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph. Some developments are summarized (“Days later, the headlines”) but do not undercut the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain holds: amber pulses → Elara contextualizes → Lira decides to tether via letters → entry into firmware memory → nursery letter-reading → dissonance resolves. Orientation is clean early, and the single transition into the “digital labyrinth” is legible. Closure is a decisive change on the page (code rewrites; lab falls silent), with an implied cost borne by Lira’s confrontation with her mother. The price is lightly rendered, but the throughline remains coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene, clear anchors, and clean causality: tile pulses → mandala patterns clarify → insertion → reconfiguration and realization. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: silence redefined as language, with a before/after legible. The price—risking the fragile hush—registers but isn’t deeply taxed. Hybrid drive tilting causal holds throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and motifs (tessera, waves, shattered sky) build to a charged reconfiguration in the final cadence. Orientation is clean early; single scene; the act of “renaming” lands as closure. The cost (he cannot undo the fire; he renames instead) is legible but quiet. Stakes remain mostly symbolic, limiting intensity.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: echoes accrue; arrivals deepen; the garden and coin reconfigure toward a convergence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost (coin emptied; self-diminishment at dawn). Orientation is clean from the outset; causality is magical but coherent. The price is felt, though not crushing, keeping it just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details stack from geode → somatic markers → “alignment” → public-facing decision. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; causality is coherent. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: he rejects the recall path and commits to a new method with implied cost. Cost is present but soft (foregone refund/therapy; continued risk), keeping this just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via layered sensory and symbolic beats (mapper → hologram timeline → algae touch → floating/spores) toward a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is clean and causality coherent; each step leads to the next. Closure lands on the page with cost: the fossil completes its purpose, crumbles, and Lira commits to awaken memory. The price is conceptual and emotional rather than plot-hard.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is immediate and clean; beats accrue (search → find → sort → revelation → release) toward a Conceptual Repricing of prophecy. Closure lands through a cadence swell and charged final image, though cost remains conceptual rather than felt. No causality breaks; the thread is coherent and continuous.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: present‑tense actions braid with reflection toward a Charged Poise closure (choosing to go to the weather station with reconfigured resolve). Orientation is clean; the pillbox and coordinates provide causal threads, but pressure remains soft. Cost is felt more conceptually than materially. Closure lands, but the decisive price is modest on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds, closing on a resonant reconfiguration (he carries his layer forward; promise “safe” with the ferryman). However, the rain‑gutter condition contradicts itself (he expects appearance only after gutters stop; ferry arrives before they start), nicking world logic. Stakes never tighten into a decisive trade‑off. Closure lands, but with minimal on‑page cost.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: sensory patterning (sun paths, phototropism) intensifies into the vision sequence and reconfigures the premise (the oasis “chooses” a timeline). Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the two‑shard structure (oasis → dawn settlement) stays coherent. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing: kindness as a temporal vector, with the lantern glass’s charged reprise. The cost is mostly conceptual (letting go, choosing to carry the lesson onward) rather than a concrete sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, beats build from dock tapping to the intimate shop moment, culminating in opening the window and humming. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: he relinquishes the gauge and she lets light in—charged poise with emotional cost. Orientation is clean and single-POV; the throughline is coherent. The causal thread (resolve → walk → offer → open → hum) stays intact without overexplanation.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres: the hum intensifies, the sundial activates, images sharpen, and Lirael reframes her identity, culminating in the spiral and her self-directed project. Closure lands via a Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: she forecloses a return to the collective by claiming authorship for herself and placing the finished book. Orientation is clean from the start; causality is lyric but traceable. The price is conceptual (letting the chorus remain past), not sharply dramatized, which keeps it shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images and gentle pressures build to the orb act and dusk submergence. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing: sharing recasts “connection,” with an on‑page price (public vulnerability) and a reweighted final image (orbs sinking, thrush song). Elara’s guidance is convenient but causally smooth. Orientation is clean from the opening line.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal throughline is firm: anomalies → funding/chaos pressure → subsonic intervention → truce → renewed threat. Closure lands as Charged Poise with a felt ongoing cost: vigilance against returning tricksters. The multiple time jumps (next morning, weeks later, another night) slightly diffuse the single‑window intensity but don’t break coherence. Setups (charts, transmitter, division) pay off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under a causal lens, beats link cleanly: organ → apparition → corridor twist → tool deployment → key obtained → gateway. Closure lands on-page with a Decisive Change (key acquired) and a Charged Poise as he steps through with risk intact. Some convenience softens the climax (one jab stills the corridor and drops the key with minimal price). Orientation is strong and the single-scene structure holds.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.0)
    Under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens, the beats link cleanly: ribbon → sketching pattern → drag imprint/handprint → locket → decision to reopen. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration: Clara “sees” Lila and reweights the case from artifact to person, with the reopening as a concrete outcome. The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than materially dear. Orientation is solid from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.1)
    Under a Situational-to-Hybrid lens, causality is clear: coded stanzas → dig → retrieval → roof ritual under the clock of the jet stream. The closure lands as Charged Poise: reading the stanza with the nail warming reconfigures the stakes without resolving them. Orientation is crisp from the outset (station, role, weather), and props are kept. The cost is implied (risking disaster/defying evacuation) more than rendered, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: find flake → infer code → play bridge‑song → activation → transition → charged poise ending. Orientation is strong from the opening, and the two‑shard structure is legible. Closure lands as Charged Poise; the “choice” is on the page, though the cost remains largely conceptual rather than concretely priced. That softness keeps it below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: two shards (train frame; startup intervention) cohere toward a quiet RR/CR closure. Orientation is strong and the throughline (break the cycle via symbols) holds. The cost is conceptual (refusal of force; acceptance of lineage) rather than tangible, which limits impact. Still, the final image reweights prior motifs effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative climax: the scene builds from telegram → prism → choice → stabilized glyphs and reweighted meaning. Closure is on-page via a conceptual repricing—map of empathy with cost marked on her skin. Orientation is clean early and the causal steps hold. Stakes resolve quietly but coherently without gaps.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: failed ritual → vortex entry via a chosen method → releasing the seed → vision → spores → reframed confession. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with on‑page cost (acceptance of culpability’s complexity). The lens reads Causal and holds to the end. Slight neatness in the seed/spore mechanism trims the ceiling but doesn’t break pressure or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: clipping triggers scar-link → vision → reappearance of the Glass Labyrinth → confrontation → choice to heed → world reconfigures. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when anchored), and lens reads as causal with a conceptual repricing at the end. Closure lands with a decisive act (pressing the clipping to heart) and a world-level before/after (two moons, scars transformed). The on-page price is present but not heavily taxed.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: barter offered → card given → stitching as meaning‑work → fruit consumed → repriced self. Closure lands on the page via a decisive ritual act and a conceptual repricing of “recklessness” with the cost of relinquishing certainty/regret. Orientation is crisp early, and scope stays within a single, coherent scene. The lens holds to the end without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal lens holds: find cloth → misread/deflect → Gus pressure to discard → logo discovery → call → redefined purpose. Orientation is clean by 120 words and the two‑shard structure (night/morning) is controlled. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with an on‑page choice that reweights his future. The cost is felt more than enacted, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.3)
    Single‑scene progression is coherent: discovery → ritual attempt → activation → reconfiguration → aftermath. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing, with the final sapling image reframing transition as continuity. The accumulative/textural lens holds; the cost is conceptual rather than visceral, which limits impact. Orientation is clean from the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs and ritual actions tighten toward the smelting act, then reprise with the child. Closure lands via a resonant reconfiguration: transformation occurs and the final image (starfish → flight) reweights the premise with cost. Orientation is strong from the first paragraph; single scene coherence sustained. Slightly soft causal stakes beyond ritual keep it shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid with an accumulative dominant: imagery and pattern densify toward a single decisive act (placing the pearl) that triggers a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is crisp early; the bunker-to-lattice logic holds within the story’s rules. Closure lands with cost (sacrifice of the pearl, new burden) and a legible before/after. The instant global payoffs (farmer/scientist/child) read slightly convenient but don’t break the lens.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single scene that tightens through discovered messages (urinal → stall → arrows → drainpipe → river), culminating in a Conceptual Repricing: maps as emotional cartography, with “Begin” as a charged directive. Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the closure lands with a real price—surrendering control for flow. The beats link by motif density rather than hard causality, and the method holds cleanly to the end.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens: Hybrid leaning Causal—measurement → pattern → shelf → book with a mild textural overlay. Orientation is clean early, and the beats advance logically to an on‑page discovery that functions as closure (Charged Poise). Cost is underplayed; the “second letter” clock adds pressure but never bites. Still, setup pays off and props (watch, cipher) are kept.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: motifs (coffee, plants, violin, “Propagate”) tighten toward a renunciation. Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis—she dismantles the dream—with a felt price (“only the ache remained”). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the setup pays off via object and image turns. Slight softness in explicit causal linkage between vision and world stakes keeps it under 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: infuse → amplification → pool cracking → improvisational “embellish” to stabilize. The closure is on-page and decisive: Elion’s echo secured, pool resealed, with a visible risk window. Stakes are signaled early and tested; the cost lands as near-collapse and depletion. No orientation debt; single scene coherence is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: present action is simple, but motifs (hairpin/shell/forgiveness) accrue to a resonant shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—contentment as practice—charged by the returned hairpin and renewed sister bond. Orientation is clean and the single scene holds; cost is subtle but present in the acceptance of vulnerability. The offstage retrieval is a mild causal softness but does not break the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.3)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative: sensory and symbolic beats (cloak, chimes) build toward a reweighted ending where Mira removes the maple chime. Orientation is clean, and closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration rather than a decisive plot turn. The cost is present conceptually (accepting doubt) but could be sharper on the page. The throughline holds without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: stones, ripples, and withheld instruction build toward Lira’s spiral and reframed understanding. Orientation is clear early and the structure (nightly returns → pattern break) provides a tidy cadence shift. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—vanishing redefined as becoming/arriving—with the price paid in patience and deferred clarity. The cost is delicate but present on the page via Lira’s struggle and Elara’s renunciation of immediate truth‑giving.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the bird pattern, hum of the arrowhead, and echoing canyon build toward a Conceptual Repricing (“alignment” over “chase”). Orientation is clean from the opening, and the two-shard dusk-to-morning structure is coherent. The closure is legible but the on-page cost is soft, more historical than immediate. The figure-eight and carvings provide the key tightening that reweights the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: spire entry → keystone activation → descent and vision → choice to reconfigure the garden → exit with repriced meaning. Orientation is immediate and stable; single POV, one transition. Closure functions as conceptual repricing with a felt renunciation (exotic wonder to mother’s garden). Cost is present but gentle, keeping it short of a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates through setting reveals (dock → hull → door 13 → pristine library) toward a conceptual repricing at the desk. Orientation is clean from the opening and causality holds (key tag unlocks Door 13; book’s hum manifests luminous vows). Closure lands with a credible cost—a self-confrontation and relinquishment of a buried life-symbol. The single-scene arc tightens without stray threads.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern density increases (static → holograms → spiral → single thread) to a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and steps link coherently through his actions at the console. Closure lands on page with the final surge and Kael’s stance crystallization, though the price is primarily conceptual (shedding doubt). One meaningful tightening—the distillation protocol—anchors the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is immediate (ancient observatory at dusk; reaper with scythe; atlas and prism), and causal flow is clean: prism → amplified echoes → awakening → spoken phrase → dissolution → reweighted purpose. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost rather than a decisive victory. The “fight back” is brief but sufficient for this length. No teleports or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clear causal throughline: attempt → calibration → synchronization → partial reconfiguration of the rift. The closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: “balanced… for now,” with ongoing maintenance as cost. Orientation and spatial logic are crisp from the opening. The cost is modest but legible on the page (fatigue, fragile system, constant adjustment).

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, discoveries (label → photos → confrontation → reframe) accrue toward a quiet but legible closure. The final image—“Let’s start here” with Mara’s photo—lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (identity shift from warden to memory‑keeper). Orientation is clean early and the single scene holds. Some reliance on told revelation (Elias’s fate) modestly reduces the pressure of the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, images and acts compound toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: translating the flock’s pattern through pain into a bridging formula. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the ritual proceeds coherently from observation to embodied risk to composition. The cost is legible on the page and reweights options going forward (“tomorrow… the final transformation”). Slightly soft time pressure keeps it just shy of a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal chain: buckle→node→diagnosis→resequence→new node→overnight stabilization→quiet reconfiguration at dawn. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the arbor is safe “for now,” and his stance toward the burden transforms. Cost is modest (fatigue, ongoing obligation), which keeps the arc credible but limits impact. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal chain is tight: confrontation → competing techniques → pivot to harmonization → willful merge via the jar → explosion → reconfigured self. Orientation is strong from the opening and the world’s rules stay consistent within the scene. Closure lands as a Decisive Change plus reconfiguration with cost (risk of mutual destruction, loss of duplicate self). No teleports or retroactive patches undercut the payoff.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.2)
    Lens: Causal, closing in a Conceptual Repricing—answers emerge when he relinquishes forcing, embodied by the brook and key. Orientation is clean, and the beats link: seed arrives → orthogonal tests → planting → growth/disappearance → slime trail → key. Closure lands on the page via the key and the spiral motif; the price is primarily conceptual (surrendering control, losing the plant), which reads but feels light. The two-shard time jump (night to dawn to night) remains coherent and supports the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece tightens through sonic density and effort until the final burst of light/voices reconfigures the situation, with a visible cost (exhaustion, blisters, hoarse throat) on the page. Orientation is clean early: who, where, and why are legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration that makes a before/after stark without violating the established logic.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: stake set (guard/return), pressure arrives (cultist), device heats/calls, choice (toss pendant), threshold opens, then arrival/recognition. Orientation is swift and legible; single transition to the atrium is paid off. Closure lands as Decisive Change with a minor conceptual repricing (“boundaries of light” as doors). The cost is present but a touch soft on the page, keeping this shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal throughline: attempt, refinement, near-success, then a tighter demand (his essence) leading to on-page Decisive Change with cost. Orientation is swift and stable; single-scene focus holds. The “vivify” recall is a slight convenience but integrates as a motivated tool rather than a deus ex machina. Closure lands with the relic hovering, nexus roaring, and visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal drive holds: tuning the shard → system resistance → dismantling the cage → surge/activation. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (tower reborn; shard goes inert) and a conceptual price (letting go of legacy design and burning his palm). Orientation is clean by ~120 words and never wobbles. The cost is modest but legible and tied to the method.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: empty hourglass → bridge state → radio signal/pattern → spectral response → merger → ferry’s dissolution. Closure lands with cost on the page (the ship dissolves; Kael is left alone) and the lens holds. Orientation is early and stable despite lyricism. The happy passenger resolutions verge on quick, but the decisive change and price are clear.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.2)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence builds coherently from weaving to eruption to void to door to return. Orientation is clean early, and the closure is a conceptual repricing: she earns a new stance and tool for living. The cost is subtle—loss of prior certainty, a reweighted reality—yet legible. Some turns are facilitated by curator exposition rather than purely dramatized causality, softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece builds from classroom to edge of the city, culminating in a charged poise/quiet reconfiguration as Lirael claims purpose. Orientation is crisp early; causality is gentle but coherent. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—the chain and stars reweighted—though the felt cost remains modest. No major turns, but the final stance is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: photo → faint pulse via hearing aid → deeper search → twin device → message → assurance to the woman. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration (assurance delivered; final beep), consistent with a causal lens. The on‑page cost is felt but soft, more catharsis than sacrifice. Orientation is crisp from the outset.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain under a Causal lens: obsession → descent → tide turns → activation → discovery → evacuation. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (risk of drowning, facility collapsing) and a reweighted meaning of cables as memorials. Minor plausibility strain in how quickly she intuits and executes the phase-transition method. Orientation is strong from the outset; single scene discipline holds.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: motifs (ink, shard, static) intensify to a quiet Earned Stasis/Charged Poise closure. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the single scene coheres. The closure lands—“I hear the future… it’s messy” with “Error… unresolved”—but the on‑page price is soft, more stance than consequence. One concrete narrowing of options would lift causality pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal drive is clean: preparation → test → activation → backlash → realization → decisive discard. Orientation is crisp from the opening and never drifts; the canyon/diamond system pays off on the page. Closure lands with cost (burn, near fall, and loss of the tool/mission) and a conceptual repricing of the “curse as mirror.” The scene holds one dominant stake and closes the before/after boundary definitively.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orientation lands swiftly (underground garden, mission, herbalist), and the arrowhead→phone→metamorphosis→return chain under a Hybrid lens coheres. Closure arrives as a Decisive Change/Charged Poise: she forecloses the path of staying transformed with the cost of relinquishing that “lightness.” The arrowhead’s spiral charges the final image with a persistent rule and price. No major causality slips; pressure tightens once cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative, lyric escalation: music seeps into cores, environmental shifts mount, culminating in a decisive orchard reawakening and statue collapse. Closure lands on-page with a conceptual repricing plus decisive change; cost is present but modest. Orientation is clean early; causal links are legible (shell → cores → geyser → statues crack). A single scene holds coherence with effective tightening at the crack discovery and the snapped string.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive: a causal act (bottling-to-drone handoff) yields an accumulative, atmospheric outcome that reconfigures meaning at closure (hush reframed as promise). Orientation is clear early; two-shard structure (pre/post storm) is tidy. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing with visible situational shift (guns lowered), though cost is more implied than paid. No major causality breaks, but climax happens offstage, slightly softening impact.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: bells → hidden door → oasis → song → reweighted silence. Orientation is clean from the opening, and the single transition is coherent. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the “key” is not the fragment but song, recasting the quest. Cost is subtle but present as a relinquishing of tool‑centric logic in favor of vulnerable expression.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and conceptual patterning (scarf/geometry/poem) build to a resonant reconfiguration. Causality is clean: scarf + hyperbolic visualization → portal → poem → altered library. Closure lands with a felt before/after, though the cost is more conceptual (responsibility, uncanny risk) than dramatized. Orientation is strong from the outset, and the midnight turn is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens: the ritual pattern tightens until the light “pools” and the vitalization breaks the pattern, forcing a reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the closure lands with the dream’s line and Elara’s renunciation. Cost is felt conceptually and tactically (ending the pursuit; empty palette). The scene holds a single throughline with one meaningful intensification.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens with a causal spine: because he acts at the nexus guided by the first star, the unlocking triggers disorientation and a reconfigured world. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: secrets recast as potentially healing, paired with a felt price (burden of voices, loss of place). Orientation is clear early and the one transition is legible. Stakes remain a touch abstract (“free an idea”) but the sequence holds and pays off.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.7)
    Hybrid drive with causal spine: detecting star patterns → aligning wrecks → mushroom/locket → luminous memory reveals → staying. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the ring reframed as mirror and the decision to remain despite the rising tide. Orientation is crisp early; props and knowledge do not teleport. The cost is felt, though escalation remains gentle rather than constrictive.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: atmosphere and pattern accrue until the advice—“walk backwards”—reweights options, and the visitor commits. Orientation is clear from the start; the structure is a single coherent scene. Closure lands as Charged Poise (a chosen path with implied cost), but the on‑page price remains conceptual rather than visceral. The causality holds, though the stakes resolve into intention rather than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.6)
    Lens: Hybrid with a causal skeleton and lyric accumulation; orientation is quick and clean. The sequence (fracture sensed → essence distilled → seed cast → orchard renewal) is coherent and the closure lands on‑page as a resonant reconfiguration/incipient conceptual repricing. The cost is legible in the final third—“the seed’s absence…a single cherry blossom”—reweighting future stakes and meaning. Minor softness: risk feels largely assured, diminishing edge at the decisive toss.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the unraveling intensifies hush → light → key, reweighting meaning and options. Closure lands on the page with a resonant reconfiguration (hush to hum; key to an unlocked door) and a conceptual cost (releasing the kept silence and accepting uncertainty). Orientation is clean early; the throughline is coherent. The cost is felt but not scarring, keeping it just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: research → film comparison → alignment/listening → activation → descent → realization. Closure lands with both a decisive change (the henge opens) and a conceptual repricing (silence as language/bridge). Orientation is strong from the outset; single POV and one scene with a brief transition hold. Cost is implied (ethical/spiritual pivot) more than dramatized, keeping it under the 9‑band.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the pattern of discoveries (loop → hum → 440 Hz link → quantum test inference) coheres and culminates in a conceptual reconfiguration. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph and the closure lands as a charged repricing of “letting go.” The cost is primarily conceptual/emotional rather than dramatized action, but it is legible in the final commitment. The single scene with a light end transition holds together without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the storm, the sequence of messages (Lira → brother → self), and the plate/bluebell finale tighten cadence toward a Charged Poise closure. The final image—trusting a ghost to keep what rain will wash away—reconfigures the premise with a felt price (choosing ephemerality and faith over direct address). Orientation is clean from the outset and the scene stays contained. The cost is modest but legible on the page through renunciation of direct speech and acceptance of loss.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discoveries layer (diary → goggles → pattern/lens insight) and culminate in a charged poise at the elevator’s arrival. Orientation is crisp from the first lines; the throughline is clear. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing—“the spire is a lens”—reconfiguring death, grief, and Mara’s role. The cost is mostly conceptual/relational and could be sharpened on the page, keeping this just shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.6)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds from observation to a conceptual repricing: the sky as memory and Lila’s pivot from external validation to personal memorialization. Orientation is clean and the single scene flows from night to dawn. The closure lands on the page with cost implied by exile, drift, and career loss, even if the price is largely conceptual. The “tower vanishes” beat and dawn cadence crystallize the before/after.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid lens held: causal discoveries (coin → panel → safe → journal) drive an accumulative reweighting toward preservation, culminating in a charged exit as demolition starts. Orientation is crisp from the first lines, and the closure reads as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise with a felt cost (the tree falls; she leaves the portrait behind). The throughline stays coherent with no soft resets. Minor convenience (instant deciphering) is offset by prior setup of the coin and her perceptual acuity.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.7)
    Clear causal chain: pattern recognition → murmurations split → perceived portal → leap → contact with luminance → return. Closure lands as a decisive change (she retrieves knowledge/experience) with a conceptual repricing of “map” and “discovery.” The cost is implied (risk, insubordination) rather than dramatized during the portal sequence, which feels frictionless. Orientation is crisp and single-POV containment holds.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.8)
    Clean causal arc: prophecy → Hall of Mirrors → anomaly → vial → chest → gears; orientation is crisp and single‑scene focus holds. Closure lands as a successful retrieval plus a reweighted self‑understanding (RR), but cost is light. The lens reads primarily causal with a lyric finish. The final ticking clock image ties cause to consequence without introducing new variables.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under a Causal lens, the chain (messages → mobilization → reinforcement → nebula flares) holds cleanly. Orientation is clear and the closure lands on the page: the arch holds. The cost feels light (effort and time), with escalation largely summarized rather than pressured in scene. Still, set‑ups pay off and the ending is legible and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.9)
    Orientation is crisp by paragraph two (who/where/what). Accumulative/textural lens holds: nested patterns, humming, fog spirals, then the lullaby reweights the world. Closure lands with cost: pane cracks and the puppet head shatters as the global cadence softens—an on-page RR/CR. No causality breaks; the beats link cleanly from discovery to activation to consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clear causal throughline (cry → markers → birds descend → door → shove → lock) under a Situational/Causal hybrid that holds at closure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: curse appeased “for now,” nut cracked, options reset with felt cost. Orientation is clean from the opening; props and rules set early pay off. Minor soft spot: the “leave impressions without touching” rule could carry an extra on‑page constraint test, but it doesn’t harm closure.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative lens holds: river/foam/chrysalis motifs build to a resonant reconfiguration where Elara answers Mara’s invitation and later co‑acts in a release ritual. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why). Closure lands via a conceptual repricing—divergence reframed as connection—with a modest but felt cost (risking vulnerability, letting the chrysalis go). The “weeks later” coda corroborates the on‑page turn without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: objects and images accrue until the note’s return prompts a conceptual repricing about beginnings. Orientation is clean and the throughline is coherent (gift of absence → unsettled wait → residue’s arrival → reweighting). Closure lands via cost accepted (loss of prized jar) and a reframed stance. Minor softness: the cost is more conceptual than felt, so the turn reads quiet rather than incisive.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: the forbidden pavilion, the pool’s shifting forms, the memory’s surge, then the kitchen reprise. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration: he dilutes the founder’s remorse at personal cost, and the fortress’s mood lightens. Orientation is clear early; causal threads hold without gaps. The arc is quiet but decisive, with the cost legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds to a resonant reconfiguration: the restored pendulum and multilingual chime catalyze communal reconnection. Orientation is strong, and the closure occurs on the page. Cost is light—more devotion than sacrifice—keeping the cadence shift from feeling fully consequential. The chain of beats reads coherent, but pressure is gentle.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.8)
    Orientation is crisp early (moonlit canyon, broken mirror, single operator), and the causal chain holds: prepare → etch → contact with alien memories → feedback threat → calibrated recovery → transformed mirror. Closure lands as a Decisive Change with a conceptual tilt: the mirror is remade into a memory mosaic and the woman’s voice returns in entanglement. The on‑page cost is mostly threatened rather than paid, so the ending feels slightly unscarred. The lens reads primarily causal with a light accumulative texture in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal chain: clock → tunnels → manuscript → threshold/inversion → map → key → exit, with clear anchors early. Closure lands as a decisive change (she acquires a unique key and reframes her role), and the rule of inversion is taught and paid off. Cost is modest (time pressure and risk without loss), slightly reducing impact. The single‑scene structure is coherent and legible throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: iterative strumming densifies until the insulator shatters and the grove sings—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with cost. Orientation is anchored early (who/where/when) and the day‑span montage serves the cadence shift. The closure’s price is legible (physical toll, broken tool), and the post‑climax teaching coda pays the repricing forward. No causality breaks or unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clear causal chain: vow → placement of stone → glow → star‑map chessboard → keyhole → opening → star‑mage → seed planted. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the covenant reframed as living practice rather than text. Cost is more conceptual/emotional than material, but exile and endurance charge the final image. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the Causal lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a causal pivot: the frequency method yields the click, leading to a reweighted understanding. Orientation is crisp early; the single-scene arc tightens around the device build, hum, and opening. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing—she redefines silence and her stance—with an understated emotional cost. The chain holds without extraneous turns.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: plant care, scent shifts, and journaling pattern build toward a reweighted ending. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration when she slows, the flower blooms, and the village stance changes with modest but legible cost (ambition tempered). Orientation is crisp throughout. Stakes are kept within the chosen scope and pay off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clean causal progression: river → arch → cavern → socket → activation → realization. Closure arrives as a Conceptual Repricing when Lira understands resilience as symbiosis and chooses guardianship. Orientation is strong early; single POV and single-scene continuity hold. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, limiting peak intensity but not clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp from the outset (who/where/when) and the causal chain is clean: surveying → anomalous readings → gust impact → climb → discovery → reframe. Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the port as “machine” reweights prior beats and implies redesign and persistent threat. Cost is implied rather than dramatized (no decisive sacrifice beyond risk), keeping it short of exceptional. The lens holds Hybrid with an accumulative crescendo feeding a causal reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: song-color density increases, the cavern transforms, and the final hymn image reconfigures the initial “sculpted hush.” Orientation is strong from the opening and the brief POV shift is legible. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with the cavern’s voice unfettered and Veyra newly aligned. Cost is conceptual rather than painful, but sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.9)
    Hybrid lens with an accumulative close: causal beats (play → fissure → descent → discordant attempt → break → silence-revelation) deliver a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure lands with cost: the broken flute and a reweighted rule (“power lies…in its silence”) that reconfigures options. Orientation is clean from the opening. No soft reset; the new rune concretizes the after-state.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain holds: intention → deliberate ambiguity tactics → press activation → empathy transposition → realization → acceptance. Single‑scene structure is clean, with the fragment’s behavior escalating in response to Elias’s choices. Closure reads as a decisive conceptual repricing with on‑page cost. A hairline convenience remains in how quickly the method succeeds, but it doesn’t disturb closure.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid lens with causal spine: warnings → encounter → directive → planting → transformation; the “plant where the aurora touches the stone” instruction tightens options. Closure lands on the page: the sapling erupts and the pendant stills, yielding a Conceptual Repricing of Veyra’s absence with a felt, if quiet, price. Orientation is clean from the opening. The only limitation is that consequences remain inward rather than materially constraining future options.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.8)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, pressure coheres from hush → visions → shattering glass → realization, culminating in a clean Conceptual Repricing. The decisive reweighting—that the arbor mirrors rather than absorbs—lands on the page with felt cost (“sank to her knees,” bitter laugh, renunciation of the theory). Orientation is crisp early and the single-scene containment supports the arc. The shattering is slightly external, but it reads as the earned crest of rising charge rather than a deus ex.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid leaning accumulative: pattern and pressure build via puzzle beats until the charged renunciation; closure is an Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with on‑page cost. Orientation is clear early; causality holds (edges align → hum → twin bead → message → sacrifice). The creek‑delivered rummage box is a convenience but becomes integrated through sustained effort, not a single fix. The before/after is legible and paid for.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.3)
    Clean causal chain: silk arrives → Jorin decides → descent → spectral keeper frames the rules → endurance trial → core fuses → world shifts. Closure is a decisive change with on‑page cost, and the lens remains Causal throughout. The resolution slides toward convenience (Lira’s exposition and swift planetary healing), but it still reads earned enough within the fable‑like logic. Orientation is strong and maintained.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is tight: shard compulsion → portal focus → encounter with alternate mother → choice to throw the shard → aftermath of earned stasis. Closure lands on-page with cost: forfeiture of knowledge and access, reconfiguring his lifelong drive. Orientation is clean from the opening and the single transition back is legible. The “choice” frame (“It’s a choice,” “You redirect”) is a touch declarative but functions coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—notes, stones, and glass build a cadence that reweights the central stake. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: the lamp is still dead, yet a “new kind of light” emerges through ritual and connection. Orientation is clean; single POV, one locale, and a coherent window of days. The cost is legible: safety remains fragile; he accepts a substitute light with limits.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure accrues via ritual intensity to a conceptual repricing—dawn as a choice. Orientation is clean, and the scene proceeds coherently from prep to release to recognition. Closure lands on the page through a charged final image with a felt, if gentle, cost. The causal skeleton is light but sufficient for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: wing → light‑tracking → travelers’ tale → flare → disappearance → reweighted purpose. Orientation is strong from the opening; the pattern of light teaches the story’s logic and pays off in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. Closure lands with on‑page cost (losing the talisman) and a new governing commitment. A shade more causal tightening at the mid‑turn would push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural, with a closure that functions as a quiet Conceptual Repricing—sorrow reframed as language as he crosses into the roots’ corridor. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when), and the recurring “pin” heightens poise. The meaningful tightening arrives with the shimmering wall and the decision to stop mapping and step through. Cost is implied (endless maintenance, sorrow persists) rather than sharply dramatized, keeping the close in the strong‑but‑not‑crushing band.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: the child’s fragment → mica intake → humming → fruit ignition → night fraying. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/Earned Stasis: the realm begins to mend while Lira accepts ongoing solitary labor. Cost is present but muted. Orientation is clear early; pattern is taught and paid off cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Situational with accumulative texture; closure is a resonant reconfiguration when Eleanor redefines “hiding” and chooses to stay with the letters. Orientation is crisp early; beats causally link (invitation → password → book → map → mirrors → key → letters). Cost is felt—accepting lostness and forgoing retreat—though opposition is soft and largely facilitated by helpers. The map-to-key turn functions as the single meaningful tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural lens holds: images and small acts accrue toward a conceptual repricing—“creeping normality” becomes a map. Closure lands in the on-page choice to tend the garden and read the seed as absolution; the cost is the renunciation of the relic’s certainty and a commitment to ongoing labor. Orientation is swift and clear; the bread→seed turn tightens meaning without breaking rules. The quiet cadence shift at the end feels earned.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Single‑scene arc is coherent: she samples, reconstructs, loses it, adapts, repeats, and reaches a stabilizing outcome as dawn arrives. The closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration under a hybrid (accumulative-dominant) lens; on‑page change is the library’s illusions brightening and her stance of earned, method-driven renewal. Causality holds—with a slight assist from dawn that skirts but doesn’t break agency. Felt cost is light but present; the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: overheard intel → stall token → key → bell → confrontation → decisive smash → dawn exit. Closure is on‑page and costly (device destroyed; fob damaged; the “hush” economy reweighted), fitting a Causal lens with a DC + RR. Minor temporal fuzz (midnight vs. “until sunrise”) doesn’t derail the throughline. The final image reconfigures her relationship to legacy with a tangible price.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece escalates via sensory density and pattern break (lavender→salt→decay→copper; aurora fracturing; ground rumble). Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: Kael reweights his skepticism as the world “holds its breath,” and the ring’s stillness reconfigures its meaning (people→moments). Cost is present but modest (blood‑taste, lost/returned ring, regret). Orientation is clean; single scene holds coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.9)
    Hybrid drive with an accumulative/textural dominance: sensory density builds to the painted door and literal unlocking, which reweights the stake. Closure arrives on the page as a resonant reconfiguration when he uses the broken lock in the shadow keyhole and then begins to create anew. The cost is felt but light—relief after ache and trembling rather than a price that narrows future options. Orientation is clean early; causality holds without contrivance.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal spine: relic → sector clue → flytrap passage → vault → keeper → conceptual reveal → reframed choice. Orientation is swift and stable, and the closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt cost (accepting “echo” over “final words”). Pressure is modest but coherent under a causal lens; nothing breaks causality. The only softness is the relative ease of access to the vault, which trims urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: discovery → construction → performance → melt‑through → final chord. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration when the last droplet falls and Elara’s single strike reframes the symphony as ongoing despite the ice’s extinction—cost made legible by the consumed fragment. Orientation is clean from the opening and the causal thread (melting drives music) remains coherent. The ending crisply articulates the before/after without over‑explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under a Hybrid lens (causal spine with textural accrual), the chain is tight: magnetic drift → fraying box → controlled burn → miniaturized orb → absorption. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she integrates the fears and reframes static as a companion cost. Stakes stay focused and are resolved on the page without soft reset. Orientation is early and clean, and the final image reweights the premise without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=8.5)
    Causal chain is tight: locket → inscription → stories → code → opening → letters. Orientation is clear within the first paragraph and maintained. Closure lands on page with a decisive change (the mailbox opens) and an emotional price. The numeric deduction via the photo is a touch convenient but seeded enough to hold.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative lyricism over a causal spine: descent → discovery → decoding dance → retrieval → drones → escape. Closure lands on page via decisive change (antidote secured) and a resonant reconfiguration (vulnerability reframed as tactic/language). Orientation is clean; set‑ups (dice, dance) pay off. Cost at the end is somewhat soft—he escapes unscathed—tempering top‑band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is clean: divination → wall panel → tunnel → rose → repricing of the pockets of gravity. Closure arrives as a conceptual repricing with a resonant reconfiguration of Elias’s purpose. The cost is light—he gains clarity without sacrificing much beyond accepting that the memories he feels aren’t his wife’s. Orientation is crisp and the scope fits the length.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=6.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through pattern and hush density rather than turns. Closure lands when the brook stills and the wing dissolves (RR-lite), but the cost is modest and opposition soft. Orientation is clean early (who/where/why). The because/therefore chain is thin, relying on ritual inevitability rather than a tightening choice.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.2)
    Hybrid leaning causal: meeting → revelation → ritual action → response forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure lands as a charged poise/CR with the building’s voice answering and the pair’s chosen lie reweighting truth. Cost is implied risk and surrender to the unknown rather than concretely dramatized, keeping this shy of higher bands.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid with an accumulative/textural dominant: density builds from whisper → memory strike → resonance ritual → release. Closure lands on the page with visible cost (garden reduced to ash; shell whisper gone) and a decisive internal reconfiguration. Who/where/when anchor early and hold. The chain is tight even without an external antagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens fits: the piece tightens from crafting to sealing to depositing the treaty, culminating in a charged final image. Orientation is clean from the first sentence (who/where/what) and maintained. Closure lands as Charged Poise with conceptual cost (blood price, treason’s risk, leaving the scroll behind), though the cost remains largely implicit. Escalation is modest and linear rather than sharply turning.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    Structure is clean: ascent → fissure voice → stone circle → revelation → charged reprise. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the cadence tightens through progressive disclosures toward a resonant reconfiguration (understanding echoes as memories). Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (bearing the unfinished stories), though the price is more thematic than materially felt. Orientation is clear from the opening, and causal links are intact.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught and held: three dream shards deepen knowledge toward a quiet reconfiguration. Orientation is clean early, the mosaic pattern is legible, and the ending lands with a charged act (placing the globe; deciding on dream‑weaving) that closes the inquiry. Cost is mostly conceptual/emotional, not strongly dramatized, keeping this short of the very top. Still, the cadence shift at the altar provides satisfying closure.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.0)
    Orientation is crisp (who/where/when established immediately), and the scene accumulates toward a Conceptual Repricing closure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The shift from literal moon‑path following to pattern‑as‑ethos is clean, and the whisk‑as‑interface clarifies the turn. Cost is mostly conceptual rather than dramatized, keeping the ending resonant but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: orchard anomalies → cottage letters → stillpoint concept → alignment in clearing → chamber reveal → sealing choice. Orientation is crisp from the opening, and the closure is an on‑page decisive change with world consequences. Slight convenience in the chamber opening and the two‑diamond mechanic is accepted because it’s foreshadowed by the “keyed”/flawed distinction. Cost is present but a touch conceptual rather than felt.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is taught early and held: storm intensity + prophetic fragments → prism activation → reweighted final image. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration/Conceptual Repricing with the threshold image (“You are the prism. You are the storm.”; the portico glowing). Cost is more conceptual than felt; no path is visibly foreclosed, which tempers impact. Orientation is clean from the outset; the single scene coheres.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: jars → activation → public sharing → purpose. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (he chooses to remember, not be remembered), but the cost is soft; no real foreclosed path beyond vagrancy-as-before.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.8)
    Clean causal chain: key falters → Elias responds with resonator → ghost opposes → harmonization reframes power → stabilization and vigil. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (the key as bridge) with a felt price (strain, renunciation of force, ongoing vigil). Orientation is crisp early, and the sunset clock and ice hum keep pressure present. The ghost’s turn is brisk but earned by the tactical pitch-match and redefinition of the key’s function.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is immediate (basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, a single night’s work culminating at dawn), and the causal chain holds: mapping → refinement → dawn activation. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration under an accumulative/hybrid lens—the hum and concentric ripples signal a before/after with the price of patience. The later shard (weeks after) extends consequence without diffusing the core arc. Stakes are scaled to the form and paid off on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.0)
    Drive lens: Causal. Lantern → visions → suspicion confirmed → hidden files → decision creates a clean because/therefore chain; closure lands as Charged Poise (resolve to expose via facts). The hidden compartment appears conveniently but doesn’t break causality. Cost is implied more than felt, keeping this short of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.7)
    Under a causal lens, the sequence is clean: visit → witness heart/specific craft → reframing → decision. Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change (he will operationalize the program), with the clockwork heart as the hinge. The cost is modest but legible as moral responsibility and labor ahead, not a dramatic sacrifice. Orientation is solid, and single‑scene containment holds.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.0)
    Causal lens holds: kaleidoscope images → alignment with the arrow → launch → tower → throw → hum. Closure lands on the page with cost: she irrevocably throws away her compass and risks the acid sea to activate the bell. Orientation is clear from the first paragraph and the stakes tighten logically. The hum (not ring) delivers a conceptual repricing that reweights the quest’s terms.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: numbers → Lazarus shadow → encrypted video → revelation → alarms/drones → choice to go rogue. Closure lands as Charged Poise: she forecloses compliance and commits to the gateway hunt with risk on the page. The cost is implied (corporate pursuit, severed safety) and partially shown (drones advancing), though the escape beat is abrupt. Orientation is strong from the start, and the lens holds.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural—images via mirrors build to a cadence shift where the shard’s glow calms the ice. Orientation is clear early, and the closure lands on the page with a legible before/after. The cost is primarily empathetic burden, implied rather than dramatized, which softens the punch. Still, the sequence coheres and pays off the set‑ups (mirror method → orchard deployment).

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean orientation and a tight causal line: keening → fissure → parasol hook → rescue → quiet reconfiguration. Closure lands as a resonant repricing (her idea of patience shifts to timely action) with a felt, if quiet, cost. Stakes are coherent and scaled to length; no stray threads. Cost is subtle rather than hard, keeping it shy of top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres as a single evening’s drift from numbness to a reweighted stance, landing on a quiet Charged Poise in the rain. Orientation is crisp, and the letter/pavilion pattern pays off. The cost is modest (abandoning the pursuit of perfect harmony), keeping the closure resonant but not piercing.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.3)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the scene builds from arrival to consecration to a quiet reset. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Charged Poise (“For now”) with the system reconfigured but intact. Causality is clear, but stakes resolve without a hard turn or price beyond exertion and exposure. Orientation is clean and the pattern is taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: images of arcs and reclamation build to a Resonant Reconfiguration in the “enough” inscription and the next‑morning return to shoot. Orientation is clean from the outset, and the two‑shard structure (day into night, then morning) coheres. The cost is subtle—letting go of a striving frame for an acceptance frame—but legible in the renunciation of a singular outcome. A slightly sharper hinge with tangible consequence could push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: pattern density builds via the crystal’s reflections to a reconfiguration where he chooses to speak. Orientation is clean from the outset (who/where/when known); single scene with one transitional cadence. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/incipient commitment rather than a decisive external act; conceptual cost is implicit but legible. Tight causal thread is secondary, but the patterning coheres without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: a ritual search in fog builds to a charged auditory find and a stance shift. Orientation is clean early; the maze-like garden and markers provide coherent progression. Closure lands via Earned Stasis/Charged Poise in the bolder chalk line and the renunciation. Cost is implicit (accepting limits, bodily wear), solid but not searing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.9)
    Drive lens: Causal with lyric accents—the tremor triggers the spin; humming slows it; escalation forces a reframe (“measuring escape”); wiring and system sync stabilize the portal; he leaps. Closure is a Decisive Change with implied cost (abandoning his world/work), cleanly on the page. Setups pay off (ear trumpet → voice; escape velocity → portal calculus) without retroactive fixes. One beat (recognizing “it’s thrust”) leans on intuition but is prepared by prior sonic decoding and instrument fluency.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single scene with one brief shard (“Hours later”) holds under an accumulative/textural lens; orientation is crisp from the first paragraph. The closure lands on the page with cost: Elias dies as the hymn culminates, and the vinyl’s handoff reconfigures meaning (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise). Causal throughline—music prompts voice, voice permits goodbye—remains coherent. The final continuation (“Tomorrow…”) widens the cost into vocation without deflating the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.9)
    Structure is clean: setup of object and theory, ticking window (isle’s shadow due north), then the causal act (“inserted the key”) yielding the reveal and reconfiguration. The hybrid drive (accumulative texture of lore + causal final move) holds through closure. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: shadows condense into a time‑reversed gateway, reweighting prior details. The on‑page cost is light (fatigue, risk implied), so the win feels more discovery than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    Lens: Causal with a clean RR/CR closure. Beats link well: intention to use the tooth → Elias’s counter‑frame and second tooth → deliberate paired placement → fountain flows → conceptual repricing (“mirror”). Orientation is crisp from the opening and props don’t teleport. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, but the before/after is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: actions accrue (polish → weigh → release) to a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (grotto, task, tools), and closure lands on the page with cost in the surrender of the pearl. The weighing beat tightens the structure and justifies the final act. No causality gaps or late rule changes.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural drive is clear: images and small acts densify until the pendant’s reconfiguration and sapling planting land a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate; the single scene coheres. Closure carries cost (relinquishing the pendant’s sealedness; inviting partnership) and reshapes the premise of grief as grafting. Stakes remain intimate but decisive within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the nexus imagery densifies until a pattern break—lantern’s extinction and silence—reweights the stake and triggers Clara’s concrete act of deletion. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost: she renounces certainty. Orientation is strong from the dock onward, and the single transition back to the study pays off the set‑ups. The seashell’s charged reprise tightens coherence at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: music intensifies, threads manifest, ecology revives, and the cadence shifts to an earned communal stasis with the seed planting. Closure lands via Resonant Reconfiguration: the magic’s return reframes from a one‑off fix to ongoing tending, with the tendril’s collapse as cost. Orientation is clean early; the beats cohere causally through ritual action under the harvest moon.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.2)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: careful construction → hum → glow → surge → wrap and depart. Closure lands as a realized success with a conceptual repricing (map as guide to the heart), and prior failed attempts and the cold anchor price. Stakes stay coherent and contained; orientation is crisp from the opening. Cost is present but relatively gentle, keeping this short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.2)
    Clear causal spine: study → reassembly → activation → echoes stored. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the hybrid (accumulative with causal payoff) lens holds. Closure lands via the device’s restoration and a conceptual reweighting about bottling wonder. The cost is more implied than felt, tempering the ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece builds through repeated melting attempts, the draft setback, the obsidian crack, and culminates in the refusal at the locket. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: he preserves a path untaken at visible emotional cost. Orientation is clear early (who/where/when), and causality is coherent within the ritual logic. The arc tightens once meaningfully around the obsidian and the final renunciation.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: details and actions accrue toward a resonant reconfiguration as she accepts “understanding, not closure.” Orientation is crisp from the outset, and the final image (lion on the sill, raindrops turned to stars) lands with conceptual cost: she forgoes forgetting and commits to carrying grief. The kettle/candle timeline provides a soft clock without undermining coherence. Quiet but legible closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.8)
    Hybrid drive with accumulative texture tightening into a causal renunciation: the dusk confrontation compels the decisive act of dropping the wheel, followed by rest and departure. Closure lands as Earned Stasis/Resonant Reconfiguration with cost: she gives up her fragments, her project, and possibly her future ashore. Orientation is clear from the opening, and the lagoon’s rules are consistent enough to support the ending’s repricing. The rose as final image coherently reweights the premise without mechanical explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.6)
    Lens: Hybrid with Accumulative dominance at the end. Orientation is clean, and causality holds: find sextant → reroute flows → projection/equation → resolve to return. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: a charged new premise (functional resurrection) and a chosen next step. Cost is conceptual rather than felt; the low on-page price keeps it mid-high rather than elite.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pressure builds from forecourt pull → bear’s arrival → quartz song → reweighted stance. Closure lands as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she refuses flight or departure now, redefines her relation to the keep with a felt opportunity cost. Orientation is clean early; single scene coherence is strong. The cost is more conceptual than visceral, keeping the turn quiet rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.1)
    Lens: Accumulative/Textural; closure: Conceptual Repricing as the sundial reframes from map to epistemic compass. Orientation lands early and the beats cohere: canal → sundial shift → warehouse → blueprint → repricing. The because/therefore is soft but legible under this lens, with a single tightening when the shadow points to the warehouse. Cost is implied (risk, self‑confrontation) rather than paid explicitly, keeping it short of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph and the scene holds a tight, single‑location progression. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the decoding beats and the apparition culminate in a conceptual repricing: the “loom” becomes preservation itself. Causality is clean (find key → unlock rope → encounter pressure → reframe), with no teleports or soft resets. The cost is modest but legible: the quest for a concrete loom is foreclosed in favor of a harder, patient charge.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the sequence coheres: thread → projection → encounter → repriced understanding. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with a felt, if gentle, cost (“lonesome splendor,” ache, acceptance). Orientation is clean early, and the single-scene frame holds. The price is modest and the apparition’s arrival is convenient, but the ending cadence is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.9)
    Lens: Hybrid leaning Causal with accumulative lyric pressure; closure lands as a Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration (palace transforms, orb reweights “genesis”). Orientation is clean early and the throughline is coherent. The sequence from lens adjustment → keening → cracking reads causal enough. Cost at the end is more conceptual than felt, making the closure solid but not punishing.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean single‑scene arc with an accumulative/textural drive culminating in a resonant reconfiguration. Closure lands via the release and the final sand image, reframing compassion as charged endurance with a felt cost. Orientation is immediate; causality is coherent. The quiet stakes are earned, though not severe.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.6)
    Structure is clean and causal: each breadcrumb intensifies the box’s hum, narrowing toward the missing eighth piece and the decisive marble retrieval. Orientation is clear early; the single POV holds; closure is on-page with the fountains roaring back to life. The vision that reveals the marble skirts convenience but is thematically planted and paid off. Cost is present but modest, more spiritual than materially constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural drive holds: the sonar’s intensifying cadence leads to the ghost, to understanding, to the final placing of the gear. Closure functions as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: fire reframed as gentler light and a forward path chosen. Orientation is clean from the start (who/where/what), and the scene stays within one coherent window. The cost at closure is subdued but legible (renunciation of the relic and implied confrontation with doctrine).

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/textural drive holds: repeated visits, density/cadence increase with the butterfly flood, and a final poem produces a resonant reconfiguration. Orientation is immediate (who/where/why within the opening), and the spectral guide is established early and sustained. Closure lands via the on-page reading and post-choice reorientation, with a legible cost of vulnerability. Some beats summarize the middle “returns,” but they feed the closing cadence rather than dilute causality.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the chain is tight: stalled bob → discovery of rake inscription → ritual alignment → resumed swing. Closure is a decisive change with a small but legible price, and the world’s response (ridge sealing, tide easing) cements consequence. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph; the two‑shard structure (ridge → tower) stays coherent. The solution arrives quickly once the key is discovered, lightly reducing perceived difficulty.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: decoding threads incrementally reweights meaning toward the “silence between moves.” Orientation is clear early (silo, gardener, discovered case), and closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a quiet, credible act (reburial). Causality is associative more than adversarial; the price is primarily conceptual rather than materially felt. Still, the because/therefore of constellation and chess symbols provides enough coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under a causal lens, the piece tracks cleanly: observation → modeling → prediction → public test → thaw. Closure lands on the page with a Decisive Change (ice cracking, water revealed) and a light visible cost (spent quill, burned journals). Escalation is straightforward and largely uncontested; the opposition is social skepticism more than active resistance. Still, the equinox scene provides a coherent culmination without breaking logic.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres as the signal waxes/wanes, the moss glow “breathes,” and Lira chases a key verse before the fade. Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she accepts the ongoing cost and steps into the mist carrying the fragments. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the beat progression is legible. The cost is quiet—time, solitude, and difficulty—rather than a decisive sacrifice, tempering impact.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: technique, gallery rules, and the mask’s function accrue toward a charged poise ending. Orientation is clean (gallery, Lira, Elias, night) and the closure lands on the page as an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise: she re‑armors and leaves the piece incomplete despite the cost of self‑erasure. Cost is legible in “porcelain edges biting into her skin” and the final swallow by the gallery. The causal chain is soft by design but coherent within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.5)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: layered finds and sound accrete toward a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis (“He didn’t stop… finally felt understood”) with tangible cost. Orientation is strong and the throughline (“preserve ancient methods” under rival pressure) holds. The shift when the sewer’s drips slow and the crude astrolabe forms creates the scene’s cadence change. Closure is on‑page, if quiet, and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orientation is immediate and clean, and the accumulative/textural drive holds: the pattern of music, objects, and “noise subtraction” builds toward a sanctuary. Closure arrives as a resonant reconfiguration—final image of the rosette spinning and a choir established. Cost is felt conceptually (world fraying, persistence against erasure) more than dramatized in-scene, which softens impact. Still, the because/therefore chain from the knock to communal music reads coherent and sufficient at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens leaning Accumulative: the scene tightens as the celestial alignment crests and her pruning reweights the plant’s essence. Closure lands via a charged poise/CR—new bud, future vision, and Elara’s plan book—showing a before/after. Cost is present (overwhelm, exhaustion, years of preparation) but not deeply biting. Orientation is clean and the one‑scene container holds.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.1)
    Clear causal chain: blackout → failed drones → lacquer box/riddle reveal → conceptual frame → Clara’s public disclosure → tower brightens. Orientation is solid from the opening; the single-turn structure holds. Closure lands with Clara’s decisive public act and the system’s response, though the on‑page cost is modest. The lens is primarily causal with a conceptual repricing of the tower’s power source.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.7)
    Single‑scene accumulative design holds: setup (object theory), action (arrangement), and on‑page closure (sanctification) cohere. Closure reads as a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing—hush reframed as potential made legible by the bay’s glow. The cost is conceptual rather than felt; stakes resolve without pushback, tempering impact. Orientation is crisp early; no lens slippage.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: arrival → Lumen’s guidance → exploit structural weakness → ampoule → revelations → decision to drink → visible world response. Closure lands with a Decisive Change (she drinks) and a Conceptual Repricing (catalyst over cure; sacrifice reframed). Cost is present (risking poison/self) though the scene doesn’t linger on consequences. Orientation is crisp early, and the causal lens holds through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the narrative coheres: patterning (counting loops, proofs, dice) densifies to the rupture and the self‑sustaining orbit. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: he reframes the goal and pays by letting the dice spin beyond his reach. Orientation is clear from the outset and causality holds (his rupture constitutes the decisive act). The cost is legible on the page in the renunciation and the acceptance of rhythm over possession.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the pattern tightens from insomnia and stalled art to the moonlit eye-painting and the neighbor’s recognition, culminating in the apprenticeship ask. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: kindness reframed as a transmissible language with a price (slow learning, discipline). Orientation is clean from the outset, and there’s no causality break. The cost is subtle but legible on the page (earned stasis with a new long discipline).

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece coheres: tour → recollection → vow → communal baking → charged final image. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—she converts curation into practice—with a felt, if modest, cost in commitment and the beekeeper’s absence. Orientation is clean and consistent; no causality breaks. The decisive change is more tonal/communal than conflict-driven, keeping it shy of higher pressure scores.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.5)
    Clean causal chain: hunger stone → yoyo integration → failed spin → mercury/coil build → lighthouse reactivates in reverse → path opens. Orientation is crisp from the first paragraph, and the single scene holds. Closure lands as a decisive change with a conceptual repricing: he “steps beyond fate,” but the stone’s hunger and the island’s shudder suggest a cost. The cost remains more atmospheric than enacted, which slightly limits impact.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.6)
    Clean causal chain: cloak’s luminance + dream dictionary → paradox tactic → moths → thread → searing grab → funhouse shudder → reweighted clasp. Orientation is quick and legible; the single‑scene window holds. Closure lands on the page with cost (burn/pain, reconfigured tool, Vey’s ethos). Slight convenience that Vey “knew” the solution but it’s seeded and thematically coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=9.0)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: layered dubbing intensifies until silence reconfigures the space. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration—chaos to mosaic order—with on‑page cost (spent body, faded tool, night arrived). Orientation is clean from the opening and the scene keeps a single, coherent drive. The final hum/silence provides a decisive cadence shift that reweights everything prior.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal chain is clean: mural → whistle → crack → tunnel → journal → watchers → repriced city. Closure lands via Conceptual Repricing/Charged Poise: the gate’s true purpose and the shells’ hunger reweight everything as the city physically turns against its inhabitants. Cost is visible on the page (collapsing tunnels, screaming populace, narrowed options). A touch of convenience (finding the mother’s specific final entry) slightly softens rigor but not the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: A → Tomas’s clue → ivy archway → tunnel symbols → ledger room → timeline reveal → reframed conclusion. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing: truth-as-seed and the lie reweighted as survival, not heroism. The “final petal” clock is not functionally paid, softening urgency but not breaking the structure. Single-scene coherence and one meaningful deepening hold under a causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid with a causal spine: note-writing → ominous sound → hatch → secret chamber → grandmother linkage → present-tense inscription. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration/conceptual repricing: absence becomes presence through lineage and record. The coincidence of the initials risks convenience but doesn't break the chain; cost is felt but soft.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Clean causal chain: blackout → sound → bronze door → pattern traced → stamp unlock → journal revelation → decision to share. Orientation is solid early (who/where/when) and the single transition to surface is legible. Closure lands as a conceptual repricing with a felt weight (“heavy” truth) and a concrete act (taking journal, leaving door ajar, swimming out). Cost is more emotional than hazardous, but present.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: polishing → installation → recording → cranes stir → shadow confrontation → poised aftermath. Orientation is clean early (who/where/when) and the closure occurs on the page with cost: she faces the shadow and chooses stance, paying in “luminous torment.” The before/after is legible (flee vs transform), with an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise ending. No causality gaps or soft resets.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.9)
    Clean causal chain: scan → alarms/overheating → descent into node → geode shatters → observatory gone → new crystal. Closure lands on the page with cost (observatory’s loss, broken geode, Orion reduced to a faint echo), satisfying a Decisive Change/Resonant Reconfiguration under a Causal lens. Orientation (who/where/what) is anchored early and never slips. The “circuit breakers” clock tightens options and recurs at the end, reinforcing consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=8.1)
    Hybrid drive with causal dominance: tracking the pilgrim → alignment insight → lever pull → chip assembly → repricing of “belonging.” Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration (listening vs acquiring), with the decisive act being the lever pull. Cost is conceptual (relinquishing the chip‑as‑answer expectation) rather than material, which softens impact. Orientation is crisp early and the scene contains one clean tightening.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.7)
    Under a causal lens: terrace → beach search → carved revelations → decision to tell Lila forms a clean because/therefore chain. Orientation is crisp early, and the closure lands as a decisive change with cost (potential loss of client/trust). The “vision via driftwood” mechanic is accepted without friction and paid off. The offstage Lila limits on‑page pressure but not closure.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    Situational lens holds: neutral ground, incoming parties, and weather create a coherent pressure leading to a stance crystallization. Closure is an Earned Stasis/Charged Poise—the deliberate dropping of the pull—with a felt cost. The exchange itself is smooth, so the causal tightening is modest and internal rather than plot-driven. Orientation is clear early and stays clean through the two-shard flow.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece coheres: motifs (compass, poles, lighthouse) densify toward a clear Earned Stasis/Decisive Change at the top of the lighthouse. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph, and the throughline (seek direction → test inherited tool → refuse it) lands with cost on the page. The lighthouse ascent and the final return paddle provide the single tightening and cadence shift required at this length. The closure image (compass left quivering, paddling away) is precise and consequential.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orientation is crisp and the piece holds a single continuous scene that tightens as Mara locates and enters the lake, meets J.T., and reframes her aim. Under an accumulative/textural lens, the density builds to a Charged Poise closure: she adopts a compass of understanding rather than erasure. Cost is implied (carrying guilt and uncertainty) rather than dramatized, but legible in the final vow. Causality is coherent with no unkept setups.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.4)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the scene coheres cleanly: offerings arrive, scent warms, song intensifies, metamorphosis occurs, and the phoenix manifests for a resonant reconfiguration. Stakes are clear early (forge a bridge beyond death or lose herself), and closure lands on the page with a before/after. The cost is present (pain, identity shift) but somewhat eased by the near‑frictionless acceptance at the peak. Orientation is crisp within ~120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: ritual actions incrementally reweight the dominant stake until the mother’s line and healed saucer reconfigure meaning. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual repricing (repentance as choice), supported by the final image of the new handprint. Orientation is clear from the opening and the scene proceeds coherently. Cost is legible but quiet, more surrender than sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain is clean: failing ship → need to activate the Tear → shadow work confrontation → “stitching” the door → opening with cost. Orientation and stakes are clear early, with a contained scene that lands an on‑page Decisive Change and the price of the relic’s shattering. The drive lens reads Causal with a thematic overlay and holds through closure. The internal trial is somewhat telescoped, but not at the expense of legibility or cost.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.9)
    Orientation is crisp from the first line; the accumulative/textural lens holds through the hush, jars, and volcano motif. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: she revalues “fixing” to “listening,” signaled by releasing the final bugs and accepting the star‑map imprint. Causality is simple but coherent (letter → meeting → final bug → listening), though the prophecy reveal leans convenient and keeps the cost conceptual rather than dramatized. The end makes a before/after legible without tying every thread.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Causal—clues and choices (“grooves match,” slot insertion) lead to the chamber; closure is a Decisive Change (they unlock the cradle). Orientation is clean from the opening, and the mechanism payoffs are earned. The felt cost at closure is light—risk is asserted (Council test, sabotage) but not materially exacted. The end image reconfigures options, but without a tangible price on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Under an accumulative/textural lens, the piece escalates via successive pattern‑attempts and increasingly dangerous star‑dust responses. Closure lands as an earned stasis/Conceptual Repricing: she shifts from control to witnessing, with on‑page cost (risk of erasure; accepting the star dust dimming). Orientation is clean from the opening. Cause‑pressure is coherent even without strict “therefore” plotting.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm pressure + timer cadence + envelope content accrete to a Charged Poise closure (sealing and intent to mail). Orientation is clean early (who/where/when). Closure lands with a credible before/after, though the tangible price is implied rather than dramatized. The single-scene progression is coherent and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive: causal fencing beats plus accumulative image-patterns (card, sundial, light) converge to a Conceptual Repricing—duel reframed as translation and partnership. The on‑page choice to follow the map together is a clean closure unit with a small, legible price (abandoning victory). Orientation is strong and consistent in one continuous scene. Stakes tighten through the projection reveal and disarm to the collaborative pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: recurring objects and phrases (tin, ink, mantra) intensify toward a resonant repricing at the molt. Orientation is crisp from the opening (who/where/when, prison library at night). Closure lands as a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing: he reframes rebuilding as growth through chaos with the tin re-sealed—quiet but decisive. The cost is subtle (choosing ongoing flux), yet legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.5)
    Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural with a clean causal hinge: the film reveals the hidden room, enabling descent and the musical climax. Orientation (who/where/when) lands early, and the closure is a Charged Poise/Earned Stasis: she elects refuge and an unplanned encore “tonight.” The cost is implicit (deferral, retreat, ache) yet legible on the page. Tight scope with one meaningful deepening.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid drive holds: causal beats (seed → dream entry → fracture vision → seed release) layered with an accumulative, lyric texture. Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration/CR: monsoon reframed from ending to beginning; memory “safe, for now.” Cost is primarily conceptual/emotional, legible but modest. Orientation is clear early; scope stays within one scene plus a dream shard.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.4)
    Hybrid lens, dominantly causal: compass arrives → lace method stabilizes → sea answers → confrontation and apology. Orientation is clean from the first paragraph; the two-shard structure (studio to wreck) holds. Closure is on-page with a decisive change (the ghost solidifies, then passes) and a reconfiguration of meaning (severance as door), with emotional cost shown. The path is a touch smooth, with limited resistance before the solution works.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. Instead of a causal chain, the narrative builds density through observation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The botanist's validation re-frames Elara's work, providing resonant closure with a clear, felt cost (her alienation from the institute). The structure is perfectly suited to the story's contemplative nature.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is clean and effective, following a strong accumulative/textural logic that culminates in a resonant Conceptual Repricing. The causal chain from ledger to frost to shard is tight and believable within the story's world. The closure lands with a clear felt cost—the abandonment of Lirael's previous artistic identity—making the before/after state legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story adopts a summary structure ("Days passed," "By winter's end") instead of dramatizing key moments in focused scenes, which flattens narrative pressure and causal immediacy. While the closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing—redefining silence—its delivery is part of this summary flow, lessening its impact. The plot progresses more as a chronicle than a sequence of causally-linked events under escalating tension.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens structure from inciting incident to resolution. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (choosing to stay) with a felt cost (his old life). The primary weakness is the link between the inciting incident and the protagonist’s choice to act; "dreams dragged him" is a soft motivation that relies on fantasy convenience rather than character agency, slightly undermining the otherwise solid causality.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is expertly controlled for this length, operating under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. The plot hinges on a single, decisive action that causes a clear pattern break. Closure is an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration with a visible cost ("the donations ceased"), which is then resolved into a new, earned state of solidarity.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through atmosphere and perception rather than strict causality, which is handled effectively. The structure is a clean, resonant journey from question to answer. The closure is a well-executed Conceptual Repricing, as the final realization re-frames the central premise with a subtle, felt cost—the loss of a simplistic question in exchange for a profound truth.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens that shifts to a Causal climax, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing. The closure is excellent: the fragment becomes inert and the visions cease, representing a clear, felt cost for her new understanding. The single-scene structure is tight and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.8)
    The plot follows a strong Causal lens, with a clear sequence of puzzle-solving that leads to the goal. The closure is a Decisive Change. However, a significant causality flaw occurs at the climax when Lirael snaps her chains by simply wrenching them; this undermines the entire "chained" premise and feels like a deus ex machina that weakens an otherwise solid structure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless causal structure under a Causal lens; every action logically propels the next toward a pre-defined goal. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change, as Lira’s perception is permanently and painfully altered on the page. The final image lands with a clear, felt cost ("the absence where love should be"), making the ending both inevitable and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, following a clean causal chain (Drive Lens: Causal). The plot turn, shifting from a physical security challenge to a conceptual one, is superb. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing (CR), reframing theft as illumination, with a clear, resonant cost in the wilted lily and the surrendered photograph.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and thematic weight toward a strong Conceptual Repricing at the close. The final shift from seeking "safe zones" to embracing "inquiry zones" and imperfection is earned. The plot's one weakness is the discovery of the hidden compartment, which relies on the convenience of the thaw rather than direct protagonist agency, slightly softening the causal chain.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a tight, effective Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages. The two-shard structure works well, and the ending provides a Decisive Change with a resonant, charged reconfiguration of the mother-daughter relationship. The resolution feels slightly convenient, with the "Weeks later" news article summarizing a complex outcome, but the on-page closure with felt cost remains very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through sensory density rather than causal turns. The closure is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where finishing the map redefines the world's darkness as navigable. The cost is made tangible on the page through the shedding gold flakes and the final star winking out, creating a powerful before-and-after state without a single wasted beat.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot progresses through the accumulation of memories and temporal data, leading to a Conceptual Repricing of the robot's purpose and the nature of thought. The closure is excellent, landing on a new, stable state of being (Earned Stasis with a new understanding) with the felt cost of its lost simplicity. The inciting incident (violin) and climax (amalgamation) are clear and effective within the brief scope.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is flawless for its length, operating under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. The inciting incident (the doodled ticket) flows logically into investigation, confrontation, and resolution. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), is earned and lands with a palpable conceptual cost: Elias abandons his world of explicit records for an intuitive, unspoken truth, symbolized by his final doodle.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal structure for its length (Setup -> Challenge -> Demonstration -> Resolution). The inferred Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens holds, with the central scene's causal turn leading to the accumulative effect on Joren. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing that re-frames "wounds" as a source of blooming, lands with thematic weight, though the on-page cost for Joren is more intellectual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, causal, single-scene structure with admirable efficiency. The progression from setup to crisis to resolution is logical and compelling, with a clear inciting incident (pulling the lever) and climax (recalibration). The closure is a strong example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the stakes from a single experiment to an ongoing, dangerous pursuit with a palpable felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates excellent structural integrity, operating as a single, continuous scene with a clean causal chain. The closure—a Decisive Change in commitment that establishes a state of Charged Poise—is rendered effectively on the page with the felt cost of a new, profound responsibility. The Causal drive lens holds perfectly from the inciting incident to the final resonant image.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure through imagery and internal realization rather than overt plot mechanics. The two-shard structure (station/village) is perfectly executed. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the "truth" becomes an anchor instead of a burden, is resonant and lands with the clear, felt cost of Lirael’s professional exile.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story follows a clean and compelling Causal lens, where each action by the protagonist directly unlocks the next stage of the mystery. The structure is tight, with a clear setup, escalation, and a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end that redefines the "ghost." The closure lands perfectly, establishing a clear before/after in understanding with a felt, resonant cost.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, accumulative structure, where each step of the journey deepens the internal pressure. The closure, a Decisive Change in the keeper's perspective, is executed on the page with a clear, felt cost (the shed self, the vanished refuge). The plot is simple but flawlessly serves the story's internal, textural aims.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, using the setting, music, and eclipse to build pressure toward a single turn. The structure is clean and well-suited for the length. The closure, Mara's change of perspective ("It's not just hair"), is a clear Decisive Change on the page with the conceptual cost of her surrendering a core part of her skeptical identity.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds pressure not through causal turns, but through a steady accretion of resonant details—the ashes, the tapestry, the diary fragments. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the "displaced axis" is redefined, landing on the page with a tangible, atmospheric shift (the "low hum") and a clear felt cost: the weight of humanity's past indifference.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling Causal drive. The discovery of the letters is a powerful midpoint revelation that logically reframes the protagonist's actions and stakes. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise; Elara's decision is made, the first move is on the board ("The game was afoot"), and the consequences are felt as an undeniable, escalating pressure. The cost—the loss of her perceived "harmless" existence for a dangerous legacy—is legible and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Orientation is immediate, and the structure builds pressure through a clear pattern of layered loops, leading directly to the on-page Decisive Change of the anchor's destruction. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "stillness," is resonant and earned, with the cost being the loss of a stable reality for a "dynamic equilibrium." The causal chain, filtered through the accumulative lens, is elegant and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive effectively. The structure builds emotional and thematic density toward a clear closure of Earned Stasis ("it was enough"), which lands with the felt cost of ongoing exhaustion and isolation. The progression is not causal but deepens coherently, with the flaring of the nautilus serving as the key intensification that validates the final stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building emotional weight through a montage of alternate lives. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR): the goal shifts from "conquering" to "embracing," with the cost made tangible by the tablet crumbling and Mara's feet touching the ground for the first time in years. The before/after state is legible and powerful, and the cost of abandoning her detached safety is clearly felt.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens to a strong Conceptual Repricing of "silence" that lands with felt cost. The structure is mostly effective, but the abrupt shift to summary ("Days passed.") after the climax flattens the narrative's momentum and weakens the causal chain leading to the story's final state of equilibrium.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Causal lens holds and the structure is sound, with a clear Decisive Change at the end that carries the cost of lost isolation. However, the plot relies on the convenience of the scientist appearing at the precise moment Elias arrives, providing a perfect exposition and the exact tool (the vial) needed to resolve the plot. This weakens the sense of earned discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure. It establishes a state of tension, builds pressure toward a single decisive action (opening the vial), and delivers a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands on the page with a legible felt cost—accepting the pain of memory. The use of the setting's transformation as the inciting mechanism is efficient and well-integrated causality.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is tight and effective for its length, holding an Accumulative/Textural lens that shifts to a Situational choice point at the climax. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of "time," lands with a clear, felt cost as Kael relives his past choices while untying the rope. The final image is resonant and well-earned.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure is a single, continuous scene that builds emotional and atmospheric density toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where the bowl's function is reframed and the community's grief is transformed into active hope, is on-page, earned, and carries a legible conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story's structure is elegant and perfectly scaled for its length, operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens. It establishes a state, introduces a test, and resolves to a clear closure of Earned Stasis as Elias returns to his work, affirming his role. The cost—his necessary detachment—is felt in the final quiet image. The narrative causality is clean, orientation is immediate, and the grotto's unique properties serve as a persistent constraint that shapes the central action.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a thematic argument that resolves in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The coincidence of the letter is an acceptable inciting incident for this mode. The closure, marked by the postcard and the ledger entry "Profit, Unseen," effectively reframes the story’s values with a clear conceptual cost—the redefinition of "profit" itself. The structure is tight and purposeful for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens and delivers an on-page Decisive Change at the end. The plot structure is sound, and orientation is handled well. The primary weakness is the resolution's reliance on coincidence: the first person Kael happens to ask for help is the very person he seeks. This convenience undermines the earnedness of the closure, making the search feel less like a true test and more like a narrative shortcut.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) drive lens flawlessly. The structure is tight, with each beat escalating logically from the last, leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Lila understands the true nature of the giant and the echoes, lands with a palpable conceptual cost and re-frames the entire story without a single wasted move.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot is the ritual itself, progressing through distinct stages that build thematic and emotional density toward the final beat. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where Elara redefines her relationship with loss, with the cost being the relinquishment of her need for a solvable "riddle." All elements cohere to produce this earned, on-page shift in understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens with a strong sense of progression from inciting incident to resolution. Orientation is established immediately. The closure is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Mara's purpose is redefined with the felt cost of her future visibility. The plot's linearity and the convenient "hunch" are acceptable concessions for this story length.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through observation and imagery rather than plot turns. The structure (two shards with a time transition) is clean and serves the concept. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where Eleanor's entire professional worldview is revalued, and the cost—the forfeiture of her old identity as a controller of nature—is clear and felt in her decision to let the nursery transform.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean Hybrid (Accumulative-to-Causal) structure, with the stranger's arrival initiating a clear because/therefore chain. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Marin's understanding of "meaning" is reconfigured. The cost is legible (the exchange), but the final note from the stranger explains the shift a little too neatly, slightly undermining the power of the dramatized discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure under a Hybrid (Causal-dominant) lens. The arrival creates pressure, the offer of the pearl presents a clear choice, and the acceptance triggers the consequence. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing: Elara's understanding of magic is irrevocably altered, with the cost made tangible by the shattering crystals. The before-and-after state is perfectly legible in the final paragraph.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully employs a mosaic structure (Track B), with a clear pattern taught early and repeated across three distinct shards. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, and closure lands with a clean Conceptual Repricing of history as a playable symphony. The plot is slightly weakened by the convenient arrival of key individuals, which lessens the earned feel of the final resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, with each action leading logically to the next. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), lands cleanly on the page with the final image of the new map. The primary weakness is that the resolution is delivered by an external agent (the woman) rather than being forced by a final, difficult choice from Elias, which softens the impact of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot progresses through a series of discoveries and reflections that build emotional pressure, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, a shift in Clara’s worldview, lands on the page with a legible conceptual cost—the forfeiture of her purely logical skepticism.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain with excellent momentum. The structure is tight, with the solar storm serving as a perfect narrative clock that drives the plot from inciting incident to climax. The closure is a clear and resonant Decisive Change, with the cost—embracing the terrifying unknown—paid on the page. The story adheres perfectly to its Causal lens, resulting in a satisfying and coherent arc.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens with a strong setup, but the resolution sacrifices plausibility for speed. The agents' complete capitulation—trading asylum and a promise to dismantle a corrupt system for a scroll—feels unearned and dramatically inert. The closure is a Decisive Change, but the cost is negligible, undermining the stakes established earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure builds density towards the intensification of the lamp's hum, which serves as the key turn. The closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Althea's purpose is reaffirmed, with the felt cost being her continued, solitary dedication. The orientation is flawless and the lens holds steady throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story establishes a strong Accumulative/Textural drive that effectively shifts to Causal for the closure. The final Charged Poise, where the protagonist accepts his new identity and purpose, is a valid and resonant reconfiguration. The structure is weakened by the climax hinging on a major coincidence—the storm conveniently shifting a container to reveal the skeleton—which feels less earned than a discovery made through the character's specific actions or insights.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story follows a clean, Causal-dominant Hybrid lens. Lira’s actions directly lead to the climax and resolution with tight because/therefore logic. The closure is an elegant Conceptual Repricing ("It was meant to be felt"), where the riddle's meaning shifts from an equation to an experience. The cost is legible in the "ache in her chest," a felt price for her new understanding, making the ending resonant and complete.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is a tight, causal chain from inciting incident to climax. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, is earned and resonant, landing with the felt cost of an ongoing struggle. The structure effectively uses the discovery of the graffiti code as the central turning point, fulfilling the 9+ quick test with a clear on-page resolution and cost.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story exhibits a masterfully controlled structure, adhering to an Accumulative/Textural drive lens that culminates in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. Orientation is immediate and clear, and causality is flawless. The final time-jump to the archivist is a risky but successful maneuver that provides thematic closure, proving the grandfather's thesis and paying off Lira's act with an impact she herself never gets to witness, which solidifies the felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless causal chain under a Causal lens, from problem to resolution, fitting the scope perfectly. Orientation is immediate, and the plot progresses with clean, motivated beats. The closure, an Earned Stasis, lands with a felt cost—the unending nature of her vital work—and the final image of the basin at dawn provides a powerful, resonant reconfiguration. The structure is simple but flawlessly executed.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's structure is flawless, progressing from a clear inciting incident (the falcon's delivery) to a resonant climax and resolution. The drive lens is a masterful Hybrid, starting Accumulative/Textural at the outpost and shifting to Causal for the journey and discovery. The ending delivers a powerful Conceptual Repricing ("Maps are lies. They erase the truth.") with a clear, felt cost—the loss of a former worldview and the end of a specific chase, embodied by the falcon's final departure.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean and effective plot under a Causal lens, with a clear beginning, escalation, and resolution. The closure is a strong Decisive Change (the town is revived) with an on-page, felt cost (Kael's departure), which functions as a Resonant Reconfiguration of his relationship to the town. Causality, while magical, is internally consistent and drives the narrative forward without any structural flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, where each action logically propels the narrative forward. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is an on-page Decisive Change—placing the vial on the pedestal—which resolves the central conflict and carries a legible, felt cost as Mara endures the psychic onslaught, making the structure exemplary for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure builds pressure through atmosphere and symbolic encounters rather than strict causality. The ending is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Elias's internal stance toward his legacy is decisively changed, landing with the felt cost of accepting his role as the story's author.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story has a clear closure unit (a Decisive Change), but the causal path leading to it is thin. The inciting incident for the climax—Elara placing the bead on the fruit—is weakly motivated, undermining the structure. While the backstory establishes the "why" of the curse, the "why now" of its resolution feels arbitrary. The plot relies too heavily on summarized history rather than dramatized progression.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through layered actions rather than causal turns. The structure is clean, with excellent orientation and a clear Decisive Change at the end—the labyrinth is restored. The cost is legible (raw fingers, fulfilled plates), but feels slightly light for the scale of the magical act, which is the only element holding this back from a perfect score.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It forgoes a simple causal chain for a series of resonant actions—wandering, listening, gathering—that build pressure and deepen the central stake. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); Lirael's choice is made, the shrine is alive but unfinished, and the community's return crystallizes a new beginning with a clear, felt cost of responsibility. All structural elements serve this final, charged image.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The plot unfolds as a tight chain of discovery: chalk code leads to a partial message, which primes her for the new letter's margin code, leading to the fountain and the final microchip. The closure is a Decisive Change (accepting her grandmother's mission) with a clear emotional cost (grief and responsibility). The structure is perfectly scaled for the word count, demonstrating excellent narrative control.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and revelation rather than strict causality. The structure is a tight, single scene that orients the reader quickly and moves toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image of the galaxy unraveling provides a resonant, on-page closure that re-contextualizes all prior information with a clear conceptual cost (the danger of a hidden truth).

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly, building pressure through atmosphere and imagery toward a clear closure. The ending is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lirael's understanding of her grief is repriced with a felt cost—acceptance, not erasure. The change in the gargoyle shard from sharp to smooth provides an elegant, physical anchor for this internal shift, demonstrating exceptional structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Causality is associative rather than linear, building thematic density around the core images of the coral and the cast, which is perfectly suited to the story's reflective mode. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira’s professional identity and emotional state are reweighted—is landed with precision and felt cost in the final paragraph. The "anesthetic" frame provides a brilliant justification for the story's lyrical, dream-like progression. The structure feels both organic and masterfully controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot builds not through causal turns but through an intensification of sensory and emotional details—the fragment, the network's notes, Marla's memory, the music—that breaks the fog's stasis. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, shifting Lira's purpose and the district's state from lost to found, with the felt cost of embracing a public, hopeful fight. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, flawlessly building atmospheric and thematic pressure toward a single, resonant revelation. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Marisol accepts a new state of being—lands with a clear, on-page conceptual cost: the exchange of certainty for curiosity. The structure is tight and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambitions.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's Causal drive is impeccably executed. The plot progresses through a clear and logical sequence: seeking an audience, passing a test, gaining entry, and executing the mission. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise, with the final exchange between Elias and Lillian reconfiguring the successful mission as merely "phase one," establishing the ongoing cost and risk of their defiance. This final beat lands with significant weight, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The plot advances not through strict causality but through a lyrical accumulation of images and internal shifts, all initiated by the postcard. The closure is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s state is fundamentally altered, with the cost felt in the disappearance of the postcard and the centuries of longing required to reach this new beginning. The lens holds from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a solution. The structure is a clean, single scene with a clear inciting incident and resolution. The closure is an effective Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lirael's understanding of preservation evolves, with the cost being the irrecoverable loss of the original sound, which is reframed as a gain. Causality is emotional and intuitive, fitting the story's logic perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The plot structure is elegant and effective, with the linguistic puzzle serving as a strong engine for the emotional arc. The Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) drive lens holds, culminating in a well-executed Charged Poise closure with a clear, felt cost of vulnerability. The plot is slightly weakened by the convenience of Henrik providing the exact manuscript Elara needs for her personal breakthrough, which feels less earned than her own deductive work.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through sensory detail and internal progress until the final conceptual repricing. The closure, where the decrypted message reveals a plea for trust, lands effectively on the page. The felt cost is the subtle but present burden of that trust ("her work was never done"), making the resolution earned and resonant for this story's scale.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=5.5)
    The story establishes a resonant Accumulative/Causal drive, and the closure—a Charged Poise where Elias commits to a new path—is effective. However, a significant causality break severely undermines the plot's integrity: Elias sends the meteorite chip away via pigeon, the pigeon returns with an empty scroll case, yet at the end, the chip is inexplicably in his pocket. This logistical impossibility is a critical flaw that would require a mandatory revision before publication.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a hybrid Accumulative-Causal structure flawlessly. It builds a textural, mysterious atmosphere where Lira gathers clues, leading to a causal climax where her action (writing a new code) directly triggers the resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change with a clear, felt cost—the inability to revisit a sacred threshold—which is both resonant and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, effectively building atmosphere and anticipation toward the alignment. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where Mara's understanding of "belonging" is reweighted by the fleeting event. The cost is the return to ordinary isolation, now imbued with the memory of connection, making the final moment of earned stasis credible.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final realization that paths are *released* rather than forgotten provides a resonant closure with a clear conceptual cost—Lira's entire purpose is re-contextualized. The causal chain is one of insight rather than action, which fits the chosen lens perfectly. The final vision in the pool provides a clear, on-page mechanism for this shift.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure within a single scene, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration of the arcade's atmosphere—is well-earned. The causality is strong, with a minor weakness in the fountain's lights flaring "as if on cue," which feels more like a convenient coincidence than a direct result of Lira's actions in a story that otherwise emphasizes her control.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through atmosphere and ritual rather than external events. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Lirael recommits to her liminal existence. The cost—pain, the verse’s transience, and continued exile—is legible and gives the ending its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building sensory and reflective detail toward a clear closure. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Elara's understanding of "illumination" shifts from seeking grand revelations to valuing subtle connections.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot is simple—a journey to a place to perform an action—but it coherently builds pressure toward the final moment of Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where Elias recontextualizes his pain, lands cleanly with a felt cost (the weight of his past now accepted). The cause-and-effect is internal and symbolic, which is appropriate for the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens with flawless execution for its length. The structure is simple and potent, building from quiet preparation to a resonant climax without a single wasted beat.

The closure is elegant, earned, and haunting.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The structure is clean and orientation is strong. However, the closure, while earned through action, lacks a sharply defined cost; the struggle reads as the necessary effort for success, not a true sacrifice or trade-off, which slightly softens the final impact.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and conceptual weight toward a clear closure. The final paragraph delivers an on-page Conceptual Repricing ("The ethical story...was a campfire"), which redefines the central stake with a felt conceptual cost. The structure is economical and purposeful, with a clear before/after in Elias's understanding of his own mission.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.5)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure is very effective. The narrative builds density through atmosphere and meticulous action, leading to a well-earned closure. The ending is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, where the monarch's visit re-prices Lirael's quiet work with profound meaning, landing with a felt emotional cost of acceptance and fleetingness. The story is well-oriented and its single-scene focus is perfectly controlled.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building a powerful ritualistic sequence that culminates in a Decisive Change. However, a severe causality break damages the climax: the story establishes the fire took Kael's "voice," but at the peak moment he speaks his mother's name "louder, the word echoing off the ice." This contradiction undermines the story's internal logic at a pivotal point, representing a significant unforced error.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through atmosphere and internal reflection. The structure is tight, leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the climax where the directive is reinterpreted.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, and its structure serves this lens perfectly. Orientation is established immediately and gracefully. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (RR)—the blooming of the orchard—that lands with the felt cost of Lira's long, solitary persistence. The causal chain is symbolic rather than mechanical, which is a strength in this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates on a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through a series of resonant images rather than strict causal turns. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The structure is perfectly scaled for its length, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the climax, where "inheritance" is redefined as an act of choice.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal-dominant hybrid structure, with each discovery logically leading to the next. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the "garden" is revealed as a choice, is effective and lands well. The cost—leaving the "unkindled solace" of the ship—is legible but slightly softened by the overwhelmingly positive framing of "Just freedom," which lessens its felt weight slightly.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens, with a clear sequence of events leading to a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is sound, and the orientation is excellent. However, the closure lacks a tangible, on-page cost; Elara gains immense knowledge and a new identity but is simply returned to her starting point, seemingly without consequence or sacrifice. This "soft reset" ending undercuts the feeling of a permanent, costly change.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, building sensory pressure toward a clear climax. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration; the final state is not a return to the past but a new, more complex harmony (“a duet of hush and hum”). The conceptual cost—that the caves’ original hymns are gone, replaced by a song that knows the “weight of silence”—is legible and resonant, fulfilling the highest standards for closure at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless causal structure for its length. The orientation is immediate, the escalation via the storm is effective, and the closure lands with both a Decisive Change (light returns) and a Conceptual Repricing (the beacon's true purpose). The cost is made beautifully legible in the final paragraph: "The void in the sky remained, a scar where light once lived."

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail—the solid fog, the deepening hush, the crystal's hum—leading to a resonant Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost (letting go of a former identity), and the fracturing fog provides a perfect, natural tightening of tension.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building pressure through sensory detail and memory until it culminates in a resonant cadence shift. The closure, a powerful Conceptual Repricing of "shadows" and a Resonant Reconfiguration of Lira's purpose, lands with undeniable on-page cost. Every element, from the knot to the note, serves this tight, elegant structure without a single wasted move.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The plot doesn't rely on causal turns but on the intensification of atmosphere and internal reflection, leading to a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The closure, where the argument's state is altered without being resolved, lands with a palpable cost—the need for patience and trust—making the final image of the turning tide resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural lens, building sensory pressure toward a clear closure. The final Conceptual Repricing (the sprout replacing the doll) lands with a legible cost (the lost anchor to the past). The sprout's appearance is a coincidence, but it functions symbolically to trigger the internal shift, which is acceptable within this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure builds through sensory detail and quiet observation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing ("perhaps it only needed to be noticed") that reconfigures the protagonist's entire mission. This closure lands cleanly on the page with a clear conceptual cost—the abandonment of her old, flawed methodology.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive lens from the initial signal to the final resolution. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where the throne's meaning is recontextualized with a clear on-page cost (the stairway collapsing). The structure is impeccably tight for its length, with each beat logically leading to the next without any breaks in causality or orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive. The inciting incident (knocking) leads directly to the confrontation and the climax (crossing the threshold). The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration—a Charged Poise—where the dynamic shifts from isolated failure to shared responsibility, with the cost made tangible by the sanctuary's shudder. All structural components are on-page, legible, and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a tight, effective Causal lens. The setup (device, bolt, pressure) leads directly to the complication (unstable diamonds) and the climax (turning the bolt). The closure is a powerful combination of Decisive Change (the farm stabilizes) and Conceptual Repricing (“Diamonds are a metaphor”), landing with a clear, felt cost (the loss of the literal prize) that is immediately recontextualized as a gain in resilience.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless causal chain: the desire for truth leads to the use of the crank, which produces standing waves, which reveal visions, which pinpoint the hidden letters. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the meaning of the "dynasty's end" is completely re-written with a clear conceptual cost. The structure is tight, purposeful, and fully resolved on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The plot progresses through a series of resonant discoveries rather than strict causality, building to a powerful closure. The final Conceptual Repricing, where the meaning of "capturing possibility" is overturned, lands with a clear and satisfying cost—the destruction of the greenhouse and Cedric’s old self.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The progression is not driven by plot turns but by an intensifying accumulation of detail, leading to a resonant closure. The final action—creating the new folder and beginning to write—constitutes a Decisive Change and a Conceptual Repricing of his role as an archivist, landing with a clear, on-page cost of accepting the unknowable. The narrative is taut and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain, which is ideal for this length. The closure is a Decisive Change (data secured, station destroyed) with a visible cost, landing with satisfying finality. The drones provide a persistent constraint that shapes the tactics of the climax, fulfilling the requirements for an exceptional structure.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmospheric pressure toward a single confrontation. The structure is tight and efficient for its length, with a clear beginning, middle, and end within one scene. The closure is an excellent example of Earned Stasis: the prophecy is not defeated but postponed at a visible physical and psychological cost, leaving the core tension intact but reconfigured. Causality is flawless within this atmospheric logic.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) lens with flawless execution. The plot progresses through a series of resonant actions rather than strict causality, building atmospheric pressure toward the climax.

The structure is elegant and complete within the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clear causal chain under a Hybrid lens, culminating in an effective Conceptual Repricing (CR) for its closure. The structure is sound and orientation is never in doubt. The climax, where Elias falls through the floor and happens to land right where he can grab the compass, relies on a significant coincidence that slightly undermines the feeling of an earned discovery, preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building internal pressure toward a single, decisive action. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: Kael’s understanding of redemption and balance is re-framed with a clear, felt cost—the finality of his sister’s absence and the acceptance of ambiguity. The structure is tight, the orientation is immediate, and the causality of the internal arc is flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a strong Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The closure, where the tooth is re-contextualized as a symbol of truth's pain and power, lands with a legible felt cost described as a "luminous ache." The structure is economical and effective for the length, with a single, continuous scene that moves from a physical quest to a conceptual resolution without fault.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully, building psychological pressure that leads to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elias redefines "mercy" as a process rather than a solution, lands with palpable cost—the acceptance of an ongoing struggle. The woman's opportune arrival is the only slight strain on an otherwise seamless structure.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) structure, with clear setup and payoff. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing that redefines the story's core concept. However, the cost is entirely external—the suffering of a forgotten world—leaving the protagonist's personal stakes feeling low and her victory somewhat too easily gained.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Accumulative/Textural drive, where sensory details build to a climax of understanding. Orientation is swift and clear. The closure is an excellent example of Conceptual Repricing: Elias’s job is re-defined from a physical repair to a spiritual one, with the felt cost of the "weightless burden of understanding" landing perfectly in the final paragraphs. The structure is flawless for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating under a clear Accumulative/Textural lens. It moves from a stable state, to an inciting discovery (the spiral), through a focused escalation, to a powerful climax. The closure is a superb example of a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the library's destruction becomes a transformation, with the cost of the old order's loss made tangible on the page. The final image of the new spiral provides a perfect, cyclical cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless causal chain under the Causal lens. The structure is elegant and efficient for its length, moving from setup to a central, risky gambit, and culminating in a powerful reveal. The closure is a superb example of Conceptual Repricing: the Council isn't defeated, but the entire narrative landscape has been re-weighted, with the shard transformed from a relic into a promise. The cost—Kael's branded heresy and his "burnished sorrow"—is palpable and gives the ending its weight.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly constructed with a tight causal chain, adhering perfectly to the inferred Causal lens. Orientation is swift and clear. The closure, a combination of Decisive Change for Lira and Conceptual Repricing for the reader, lands with a tangible, on-page cost (the pain of her confession), making the resolution feel both inevitable and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) drive that lands a strong Conceptual Repricing closure. The plot progresses logically from the inciting incident (finding the compass) to the final choice. The cost—exchanging a solvable mystery for a profound, permanent one—is legible and reconfigures the protagonist's core motivation, making the "before and after" state clear.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story follows a clear, if simple, causal chain (find object, use object, gain insight) and lands a valid Conceptual Repricing for its closure. However, it fails the cost-proof test; Lira gains knowledge and purpose without any visible sacrifice, trade-off, or felt loss, which significantly undermines the resolution's weight. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but the resolution feels more like a convenient magical gift than an earned reweighting of the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The plot progresses through a series of deepening discoveries rather than conventional turns, building elegantly toward the closure. The final image provides a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Mara’s relationship to the mystery is transformed with a clear, felt cost—the release of a simple solution for a lifelong process.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.0)
    The story follows a strong Causal lens with clear because/therefore linkages leading to the climax. A Decisive Change occurs on the page, but its logic is flawed. Mara’s claim that "The truth's out there now" directly after destroying the final codex—which Elara established was essential—creates a significant causality break in the resolution, undermining the story’s internal stakes and rendering the final outcome conceptually incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing of "revival." However, the closure lacks a legible cost; Elias’s initial hollowness is resolved without a visible trade-off, which weakens the impact of his achievement and feels more like a seamless victory than an earned transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is excellent, operating under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot progresses logically from a triggering anomaly (the silence) to a re-investigation and finally to a Conceptual Repricing of the prophecy's meaning. The closure is a potent form of Charged Poise, where the stakes are reconfigured with a felt cost—the burden of knowledge and anticipation—which lands beautifully in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.5)
    The story has a clean structure and a resonant closure (a Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing). The central causal mechanism is severely flawed; the claim that introducing disorder via decaying seeds will "decrease entropy" is a direct contradiction of the scientific principle it invokes, creating a significant logical break in the story's climax.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=9.2)
    The causal structure is exceptionally clean for this length, moving from problem to complication to resolution with logical precision. The story establishes its stakes and setting immediately and proceeds without any lapses in causality. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lira establishes a new, harmonious stasis (Charged Poise), is earned on the page with a clear felt cost—the acceptance of a greater, more active responsibility.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building toward a quiet but potent closure. The ending is a Conceptual Repricing: the speck of stardust in the lantern reframes the science/spirit conflict, landing with a felt cost represented by the star's absence and the lantern's dimmed light. The structure is elegant and perfectly suited to the story's length and ambitions, with a clear before/after shift in understanding between the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and imagery rather than strict causality. The structure is clean for this length, leading to a Decisive Change at the end: Elias speaks, the box shatters, and his internal burden is lifted. This closure lands with a clear, felt cost (the end of his long-held vigil) and is executed cleanly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a strong Accumulative/Textural structure, building to an effective Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands with a clear cost—leaving the urn fragment—and redefines the protagonist's relationship to time. A minor weakness is the introduction of a plan ("embed messages in garage sale item descriptions") that is immediately altered to embedding them "in his mind," creating a slight wobble in the plot's internal logic.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates on a strong Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure builds density from the inciting incident (the kite string snapping) to the final image. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing, where Lira accepts the impermanence of her creation, a cost that recontextualizes her entire practice. Causality is textural rather than sequential, but the progression from discord to creation to acceptance is impeccably logical and cohesive.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through the methodical act of weaving copper wire until the climactic release of energy. The structure is elegant and efficient for its length, with a well-handled time skip to the resolution. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Lira's death is the legible and deeply felt cost for restoring the island's harmony, creating a poignant and satisfying before/after state.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is tight, leading to a sophisticated closure that combines a Conceptual Repricing (the meaning of the "pilgrimage" is re-evaluated) with a Charged Poise (the open door). The cost—the loss of Lirael's protective skepticism—is felt on the page, making the internal change legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The structure is a single, perfectly paced scene that builds thematic density towards its closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). The final image of the flowers against the storm, charged by the coachman's internal shift, lands with palpable cost (the long, patient struggle ahead) and hope. The lens holds, and the closure is both quiet and powerful.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building meaning through a series of revelations. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing for the community, is clear and on-page. However, the cost is a background condition (the war's aftermath) rather than a price paid in the present moment, which softens the impact of the final positive shift. Causality within the magical-realist premise is consistent, but the plot unfolds as a gentle sequence rather than a structure of mounting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless two-shard structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Conceptual) lens. The plot is propelled by the established logic of the "glimpse," leading to a powerful Conceptual Repricing of "true north" at the close. The final image provides a resonant sense of Charged Poise, with the cost—abandoning a life of analytical certainty—being clearly felt in the character's changed behavior.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure appropriate for its length, with a clear inciting incident, rising action, and a decisive change for closure. The primary weakness is the absence of a legible on-page cost. Kael succeeds completely without a visible sacrifice, trade-off, or lingering consequence, which makes the triumphant resolution feel less earned and impactful.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through ritualistic action until a pattern break (the king toppling) forces a resolution. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing, where Elara’s understanding of her own role is fundamentally re-written. The cost is legible and the ending provides a decisive new direction, demonstrating masterful structural control within the short form.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, Causal-to-Accumulative Hybrid lens. The setup (pain of forgetting -> decision to act) leads to a powerful climax where an accumulation of imagery reconfigures the protagonist’s reality. The closure is an excellent on-page Decisive Change and Conceptual Repricing ("home" as an act, not a place), anchored by a specific, felt cost ("Pain lanced through her"). The structure is tight and effective for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear and satisfying symbolic logic, successfully using an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is tight for its length, moving from external puzzle to internal confrontation and back to external resolution. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Alaric's failure, is achieved on the page with a clear felt cost—the acceptance of an unchangeable past—making the final moments resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is taut and effective under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure builds through imagery and declarative acts, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the canyon's atmosphere shifts. The closure lands on the page with a clear conceptual and social cost ("tomorrow, the elders would call him a heretic"), making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure builds pressure through symbolic imagery and sensory detail, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot builds through a series of ritualistic, causally linked actions, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) that lands with undeniable force. The closure, with the spinning censer and her grandmother's final command, reweights the entire narrative with a felt cost (her hair, her effort) and opens a new, vast frontier for the protagonist. The magical causality is internally consistent and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=6.4)
    The causal structure is tight and efficient for the length, with Jorn's arrival providing a clear escalation. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing, which is a valid form. However, it fails the Cost Proof Test; the ending offers hope and an abstract plan, but the price of this new knowledge and path is not felt on the page, weakening the closure's impact. A minor but notable flaw is the contradictory backstory for the glass eye (historian vs. library).

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The inciting incident (the boutonnière) leads directly to the investigation, confrontation, revelation, and a decisive choice. The closure provides a Conceptual Repricing of Elias’s role and a Decisive Change in his mission, with the felt cost of taking on another’s burden. The structure is tight and purposeful for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.0)
    The structure is elegant and efficient, following a clear causal chain (Hybrid lens, with Causal closure) that leads to the climax. The closure unit is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the meaning of the "doorway" is re-evaluated with a felt cost—the abandonment of a magical escape for earned self-awareness. The final image of her following the ants home provides a legible before/after state, perfectly executing the closure requirements for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's Causal lens is held perfectly, with a clear chain of events leading to a valid and earned closure. The ending is an effective use of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the queen's understanding and future choices with a palpable felt cost—the burden of self-knowledge. The structure is clean, tight, and well-suited for the story's length.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story follows a clean Causal lens, where Jorin's discovery directly enables Elara's breakthrough. The closure is a Decisive Change, with the nexus stabilizing on-page, and the cost is felt through the memory of prior failures. The convenience of the ledger's appearance is a minor contrivance, but the structure is otherwise tight and effective for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through symbolic discovery rather than pure causal plot. The structure is elegant: the grave poses a question, the first scroll provides a path, and the second scroll prompts the closure. The final Conceptual Repricing, where Elias re-evaluates his relationship with his past, is earned and lands cleanly on the page with a palpable conceptual cost—the death of his self-pity.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building pressure through layered details rather than overt causal turns. The structure is tight, moving from object to clue to realization with clean logic.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a Causal lens with a clear setup and payoff structure, culminating in a resonant final image that provides closure with cost. The primary weakness is a significant causal gap: Clara’s leap of knowledge about the bottle’s specific function (“induced currents,” copper wings, vibration) is not earned. It feels like a convenient authorial insertion to make the climax work, rather than a discovery rooted in her established character or the scene's logic.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    The story operates on an Accumulative/Textural lens, where causality is symbolic. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the dictionary goes blank, lands effectively, signifying a shift from external guidance to internal process. However, the inciting incident (the mural figures appearing and speaking a riddle) feels like a convenient device rather than an earned consequence of the Witness's actions, softening the narrative cause-and-effect.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.5)
    The Accumulative/Textural drive is executed flawlessly, using the countdown as a structural spine to build atmospheric pressure. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR), where the fundamental nature of clocks is re-evaluated with a clear conceptual cost—the loss of a simple mechanical universe for a more emotionally profound one. The causality is perceptual, fitting the lens perfectly, and the final image lands with undeniable weight.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear causal lens, moving from problem to a deepened understanding and then to resolution. The closure is a Decisive Change with a conceptual cost (Kael sheds his old worldview). However, the causal link at the climax—tuning a laser to the "vibrations of Lira’s voice when she’d spoken of trust"—is a significant leap of logic that reads more like a magical fix than an earned technical or intuitive solution.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Hybrid drive, using a clear causal chain (clue -> discovery -> choice) to arrive at a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The ending, where Clara understands contradictions as "mirrors," recontextualizes her entire relationship with her father's work and her own grief, landing with palpable emotional cost ("tears mixing with rain"). The structure is tight, economical, and fulfills the 9+ requirement of an on-page closure with felt cost under a consistently held lens.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly. The pattern of vignettes builds thematic density toward a quiet but powerful closure.

The plot is elegant, coherent, and perfectly suited to the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Structure is simple but perfectly suited to the length, building density through resonant images toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Elara redefines the covenant's weight as being "in the now," lands with a clear conceptual cost—the acceptance of an endless, attentive present. Causality is internal and psychological, and the final shift in understanding is both earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is tight and purposeful, following an Accumulative/Textural drive that builds atmosphere and conceptual weight towards its climax. The closure is a superb example of Conceptual Repricing (CR): the ghost's redefinition of loneliness as a "language" reframes the entire premise with a felt conceptual cost—the loss of a simple cure for a more complex truth. This change is anchored on the page in Elias’s changed emotional state, making the ending both resonant and structurally sound.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.5)
    The plot follows a clear, linear progression under a Hybrid (Causal-Accumulative) lens, with each location providing a new piece of the puzzle. The discovery of the map serves as a meaningful turn that alters the protagonist's method. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration, where the meaning of the quest is transformed, and the cost is the acceptance of memory over physical presence. The structure is sound and serves the story's length perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The Causal drive lens is held consistently, with clear because/therefore linkages. The story structure is sound, moving from problem to a well-defined climax and resolution. The closure, a Decisive Change in Elias's approach, is earned. However, the final line—"a girl’s fever broke"—erases the primary external consequence too neatly, slightly undercutting the felt cost of his mistake and the gravity of his new, less controlling philosophy.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure builds from a single point of pressure—Kael’s action—and escalates by increasing density and emotional weight, rather than through causal turns. The closure is a strong Conceptual Repricing, where silence is re-contextualized for the community with a clear, felt cost for Kael (the transient nature of the joy), landing perfectly on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building thematic density toward a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final reveal and the healing portrait provide a legible before/after with a clear, felt emotional cost. The internal logic, while magical, is consistent and the symbolic causality is strong, making the resolution both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=4.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere toward a resonant closure. However, the unmotivated and jarring shift from third-person ("Eli stood") to first-person ("my chest ache," "I asked") midway through is a critical structural failure. This break in the narrative contract severely undermines the story's coherence and reads as a significant technical error, making it unpublishable as is.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative follows a clear causal chain under a Hybrid lens, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing. The discovery of the chamber and the maps doesn't just resolve the challenge; it re-weights the entire premise of the labyrinth and Elias's relationship to it. The closure is on-page, resonant, and the conceptual cost—the obsolescence of his old methods—is perfectly legible in the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively. The plot is a single, continuous beat that builds atmospheric tension and resolves it through a sustained action, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (the "stillwater tension" softens). The closure lands with a felt, if subtle, cost: her duty is endless ("The darkness would always return, and so would she"). The structure is spare, legible, and well-suited to the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) drive lens flawlessly. The single-scene structure is tight and focused, building emotional pressure through interaction rather than plot machinations. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration, where Lila's shift from observer to participant provides a powerful "after" state with a clear, felt emotional cost.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clear and effective causal structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative-Causal) lens. Orientation is strong, and the plot progresses logically from the inciting call to the climactic choice. The closure is a Decisive Change (releasing the scrimshaw) with a Resonant Reconfiguration (her freedom) that lands with the tangible cost of her lost home, making the before/after state legible and impactful. The structure is flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its Accumulative/Textural drive perfectly. The structure builds pressure not through causal turns but through the deepening significance of a single ritual. The closure is a clear and powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Lirael crystallizes her method of endurance with a felt cost—a life of solitary, repeated creation—making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure is a single, continuous scene that builds pressure through sensory intensification rather than traditional causal turns. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), with the final image of Lirael on liquid glass providing a definitive "after" state with the felt cost of leaving the old world's rules behind. The piece excels at its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive, where each action logically propels the next. The structure is tight, moving from inciting incident to a revelatory climax without wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.6)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through layered ritualistic action rather than causal plot turns. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration, transforming Elias's relationship with grief at a visible cost ("fingers bled"). The structure is sound for its length, though the final reveal of the wife's inscription feels like a sentimental button that slightly over-explains the preceding emotional shift.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly for its length. There is no traditional plot, but the accumulation of imagery and concepts leads to a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is excellent for its Accumulative/Textural drive. It builds pressure not through a causal chain but through an intensification of atmosphere and philosophical debate, culminating in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where Lirael embraces the light and walks deeper into the archive, is a strong, earned image of Charged Poise, with the cost—isolation and the embrace of a dangerous path—legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens from the inciting incident (the spiral on the stone) to the Decisive Change at the climax. The closure lands effectively, with the cost of transforming hope legible in Thalos’s regret. The introduction of the "future stone" via the time-sharing network is an efficient piece of exposition that enables the climax without breaking established causality.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, using an Accumulative/Textural drive. Orientation is immediate and clear. The story builds pressure through reflection and focused action, culminating in a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) where Lira's understanding of fragility is transformed. The cost—the shedding of her illusions—is felt, making the final image of the lifting mist earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is elegant and effective, adhering perfectly to an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The progression from the inciting incident (touching the hourglass) through the memory visions creates a coherent deepening of knowledge and emotional pressure. Closure is achieved through a clean Resonant Reconfiguration, where Mara's internal state is transformed with a clear, felt cost (reliving trauma), marked by the decisive on-page action of the hourglass shattering.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, effective Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and strong. The central beat—the psychometry reading—accumulates information that deepens the initial stake, leading to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at the end. The closure lands clearly on the page as Mara accepts a new purpose, with the scent of lilacs confirming the shift, and the cost is the emotional weight of this new life mission. The causality is flawless within its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere until the final breakthrough. The closure is a clear Decisive Change in Kael's internal state. However, the causal chain feels somewhat frictionless; Kael faces no significant setbacks or opposition. The "cost" of his transformation—feeling like drowning—is present but feels more like a momentary overwhelm than a lasting price, slightly softening the impact of the earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, culminating in a clear Decisive Change with a felt cost (Kael's new identity/role). However, the causal link at the climax—the leap from "thinking about freight" to "standing in three places at once"—is tenuous, justified only by the phrase "through wave functions," which acts as convenient magic rather than earned causality, even for this mode.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.0)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory detail toward a Conceptual Repricing (the gear is a seed, not a key). The closure lands with the felt cost of giving up the tangible link to her father. However, the causality is slightly weakened by the father's hologram appearing to explicitly state the final step ("you must let go"), which feels more like convenient exposition than an earned deduction by the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates flawlessly under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure—a journey out to a point of revelation, then a return—is simple and powerful. The closure is an excellent example of Conceptual Repricing, where the goal of the vigil is re-framed not as finding a place but as enabling a quality in others. The final image of waiting for the "next leash to break" creates a perfect, resonant stasis with a clear felt cost: their duty is eternal.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.2)
    The causal chain is strong until the pivotal moment of insight. The leap from observing a "faint yellow stain" to a complex understanding of "unspoken pacts" is a significant logical gap that undermines the protagonist's earned discovery. While the closure lands with a Decisive Change, the key beat that enables it feels like an unearned convenience, weakening the overall structure.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.0)
    The plot is built on a clean, logical causal chain, and the closure—a Decisive Change—is executed on the page with a clear before/after state. However, the progression feels somewhat frictionless, like a sequence of solved puzzles rather than a struggle against active opposition. The immediate acquiescence of the courtiers makes the resolution feel convenient and less earned.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building pressure through a series of discoveries. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), is valid and the cost—the abandoned station—is legible. The plot's resolution hinges on a convenient coincidence (the bioluminescent plankton), which softens the causal integrity, and the explanation for the phenomenon remains vague ("awakened something older").

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, effective structure under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, culminating in a clear Decisive Change on the page. The plot is internally consistent, setting up its mystical premise and paying it off. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the risk of failure is present, but the resolution is so positive that the price Lira paid (enduring ridicule) feels pre-paid rather than transacted at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.4)
    The story follows a clean, Causal drive lens, with a clear sequence of events leading to a Decisive Change. The closure lands on the page as she plants the embryo, with the felt cost being the risk she embraces ("They might call her mad"). The plot's only minor weakness is the sudden introduction of "the drones return" as an urgent pressure point, which feels slightly convenient rather than an organically escalating threat.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through sensory details and memory fragments rather than external plot turns. The closure is a strong, on-page Conceptual Repricing where Lila reframes the "pearl of stillness" from an escape to a lens. The cost—accepting a world that is both "terrible and tender"—is legible and gives the ending its weight, fulfilling the requirements for a powerful internal arc at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length and accumulative lens. It establishes the core problem, introduces a catalyst (the thread), and builds pressure through a single, powerful intensification (the closing walls), leading to a decisive on-page action. The closure is a superb example of Conceptual Repricing, where the final image reconfigures the story's central question about fragmentation into a hopeful, resonant answer with a clear conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates on a clean, propulsive Causal lens, where each discovery logically enables the next action. The structure is an effective two-shard sequence (encampment investigation to tower approach) that builds momentum without deviation. The ending is a perfect example of Charged Poise, a resonant reconfiguration where Lira's quest shifts from searching to confronting, with the cost of entering the unknown made tangible. This closure feels both earned and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens from the inciting incident to the conclusion. The structure is tight, and the closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—lands with a clearly legible cost on the page ("The Council would come for them"). The final image of the two united against a known future threat provides a powerful and earned resolution for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully. The structure is a single, continuous scene where memories and symbolic objects build pressure toward a final realization. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the farm becomes a "revolution," lands with the felt cost of her father's absence and her acceptance of this quiet, solitary path. The causality is thematic and emotional, which is perfectly executed for this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive with near-flawless precision for this length. Orientation is immediate and clear, and the structure follows a ritualistic escalation that feels both logical and mythic. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—is delivered on the page with a legible and poignant cost: "The goddess was gone," leading directly to the stabilization of the constellations. The before/after state is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and efficient Causal lens. The inciting incident (the call) leads directly to the investigation, which leads to the discovery (the memo), the climax (giving the proof), and the resolution (fallout and new purpose). The closure is a strong Decisive Change with a Conceptual Repricing, and the cost is felt on the page. The structure is perfectly scaled for the word count.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=4.8)
    The plot relies on a significant coincidence: the scientist behind the guilt-ridden firmware is Lira's own mother, who conveniently guides her. This contrivance undermines the story’s causal integrity, transforming a promised “digital labyrinth” into a simple, directed task. While a Decisive Change occurs on the page, the path to it feels unearned and overly tidy, reducing the felt cost of the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building pressure through a sequence of resonant discoveries rather than strict causal turns. The structure is impeccably clean, moving from discovery to investigation, climax, and a final reorientation. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing where the "emergent hush" is redefined as a language, landing with the felt cost of Mara’s old worldview and the weight of a new purpose. All elements cohere to produce this final, resonant shift.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure effectively. The single, continuous scene builds atmospheric pressure toward a clear closure unit: a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias’s symbolic act redefines the plaza’s meaning. This closure lands on the page with a legible felt cost—his "hope and resignation"—making the before/after state of his resolve clear without needing a decisive external plot turn.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through layered imagery and sound rather than simple causality. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration: the tarot coin, now blank, serves as a perfect on-page receipt for the cost of unifying the timeline, making the final state and its price perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, moving from problem to process to a Decisive Change at the end. The closure lands with a felt cost—the memory of the shock and the effort of his work—making the breakthrough satisfying. The structure is tight and purposeful for the story's length, with no wasted motion.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.8)
    The accumulative structure is executed flawlessly, building pressure through sensory investigation toward a clear Decisive Change. The closure lands with a tangible cost—the fossil crumbling to dust—which is earned and locks in the protagonist’s transformation. The drive lens holds perfectly, but prose artifacts in the final beat prevent a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story successfully uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and associative logic rather than strict causality. Orientation is strong, and the closure lands as a clear Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara's perspective shifts. The link between sorting buttons and unlocking the jar is metaphorical, but holds within the chosen narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building pressure through atmosphere and memory to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the end. The closure, where Mara's resolve crystallizes, lands with a felt cost of accepting risk. However, the inciting realization that "the codes in the snow" were metaphorical feels retroactively explained rather than dramatized, slightly softening the causal chain leading to the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story operates under a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, and its structure is perfectly suited to this mode. The plot is a simple, elegant sequence—waiting, crossing, arriving—that serves as a frame for textural deepening. The closure is a clean and effective Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the cycle of the crossing is completed and reaffirmed, with the quiet cost being the dedication of a life to this ritual. The causal logic is atmospheric, not mechanical, and it holds perfectly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a strong Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) drive, culminating in a clear Conceptual Repricing. The progression from observing anomalies to triggering the vision feels earned within this mode. The final image provides resonant closure, reconfiguring Mara's purpose with a felt conceptual cost—the responsibility that comes with her new understanding.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, two-shard structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens, moving effectively from reflection to action. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the opening of the window provides a potent visual shift. The cost of vulnerability is legible and earned, creating a satisfying before/after state without needing a dramatic plot turn. The narrative logic holds perfectly from start to finish.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Pressure builds through the intensifying hum of the stone circle, leading to the climax without forced causal links. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (her relationship to the past is re-weighted) that becomes a Decisive Change (the choice to write). The cost—embracing her solitude—is felt, and the final image provides a perfect cadence shift.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, where resonant images build to a thematic climax. The closure, a Decisive Change in Lila's perspective, lands cleanly with a felt cost of vulnerability. However, the plot's primary mechanism—the public art installation—appears as a convenient, almost magical solution to Lila's specific problem, which slightly undermines the sense of earned causality, even for this narrative mode.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a strong Causal lens through the main conflict. The closure is an effective Charged Poise, establishing the ongoing "game." However, the multiple time jumps in the final third (resolution, "weeks later," "one night") diffuse the focus slightly, making the structure feel more like a summary of events than a single, taut narrative shard.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates excellent causal logic, with each event precipitating the next in a tight, escalating sequence. The structure is clean, building to a clear climax. The closure, a form of Charged Poise, lands effectively on the page, reconfiguring the character's reality with a legible, forward-looking cost, fulfilling the requirements for this length perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=6.2)
    The story follows a clear Causal drive, but the resolution hinges on a major coincidence—the lantern conveniently glinting off the locket. In a mystery plot, resolving a central problem with luck rather than earned deduction undermines the structure. The closure is a Decisive Change, but it lacks a tangible cost, softening its impact.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a strong, clear Causal lens, with each discovery logically leading to the next action. The structure is efficient for the word count, and the closure—a Charged Poise—is executed effectively on the page, crystallizing the stakes and the cost (imminent disaster) without needing to show the outcome. The convenience of how quickly Clara deciphers codes and finds the journal is a minor weakness, but it doesn't break the core causal integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive, gathering strange, resonant details that culminate in a magical transition. The closure is a perfect example of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the protagonist's options and reality with a clear, felt cost—the forfeiture of his old world. The structure is tight, orientation is immediate, and the fantastical causality is internally consistent and earned by the story's unique logic.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=5.8)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens, and the closure—a Conceptual Repricing of the money and his past—is on the page. However, the causal link that enables this closure is critically flawed. The collapse of the founders' trust is the story's pivotal external event, yet it occurs entirely off-page and is delivered through a brief, tensionless summary, which severely weakens the structure.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene causal structure that is highly effective for its length. The plot is propelled by Veyra’s arrival, which introduces a clear deadline and forces the central choice. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) where the temple's nature is re-contextualized as a map of empathy, achieved with the on-page, felt cost of Lirael surrendering her emotional detachment.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, where each action logically propels the narrative toward its climax. The closure, a Decisive Change in Mira's self-perception, lands with a clear felt cost—the loss of her self-image as purely a "force for good." The plot mechanics rely on the plant seed's convenient dual function (truth-seeking and memory-clarifying), which is a minor contrivance preventing a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story exhibits a clean, effective causal structure under a Causal lens. Each beat logically follows from the last, from the clipping activating the vision to the final choice. The closure is a decisive change—the covenant mended within Lirael, symbolized by the two moons—with a clearly legible cost: the surrender of her prior self to integrate the pain of both worlds. The structure is flawless for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure under a Causal lens. The closure is a Decisive Change, achieved on the page through a clear ritual, with the cost—giving up her past self-concept symbolized by the Fool card—made tangible. The progression from arrival to transformation is seamless and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clear and effective Causal lens, with each discovery propelling the next logical step. The structure is tight and well-suited to the length, delivering a Decisive Change at the end. The resolution via a single phone call to a reclusive bassist is a minor contrivance that slightly softens the believability of the climax, but it functions to bring the arc to a satisfying close.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean and effective Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the arbor's physical change and Elara's conceptual shift land with the felt cost of accepting an endless, evolving task over a final, static answer. Orientation is established immediately, and causality remains coherent within the world's logic, leading to an ending that feels both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure excels under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The plot is not a causal chain but a purposeful deepening of the core concept, moving from demonstration (the woman) to resonant reaffirmation (the child). The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where a starfish's dissolution enables a fish's flight, is well-executed and lands with a clear conceptual cost ("ashes of the old"), making the story's central loop feel earned and eternal.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through resonance and sensory detail to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration at the climax. The closure lands effectively as Elias's role is transformed. However, the structure is significantly weakened by the final two paragraphs, which act as an unnecessary epilogue, summarizing long-term effects ("Years later...") and diluting the powerful final image of the crown by explaining it. This breaks the single-scene focus and lessens the impact.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is flawless for its length, operating under a clean Accumulative/Textural drive. The progression from one clue to the next builds narrative density and reweights the protagonist's understanding. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts her path, lands with a palpable felt cost—the embrace of a messy, unfiltered emotional reality.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean and satisfying Causal lens, where each discovery logically enables the next step. The structure is tight and well-paced for its length, and the closure—a Decisive Change in finding the book—lands effectively on the page. The primary weakness is the legibility of the cost; the final "mix of fear and excitement" hints at a price, but it remains abstract and lacks the visceral or conceptual weight needed for a higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. Orientation is immediate and evocative. The plot advances not through external events but through a deepening of internal pressure, culminating in an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration—the violin shattering as Lira dismantles her dream. The cost is made tangible in the final line's "ache," providing a deeply satisfying and legible closure that perfectly suits the story's lyric mode.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=9.5)
    The plot structure is flawless for its length, operating on a clean causal chain. The initial problem's solution (amplifying the echo) directly causes a greater complication (the cracking threshold), demonstrating tight, escalating causality. The closure is a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a felt cost, leaving the character and her world in a newly understood, stable state.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story uses an effective Accumulative/Textural structure, building to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end where contentment is reframed as a practice. The closure lands with a felt cost—the acceptance of ongoing vulnerability. The plot is slightly weakened by the convenience of the merchant returning the hairpin; his guilt-driven return feels like a soft resolution for the external plot point, though the internal arc remains strong.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene causal structure that culminates in a Decisive Change for the client, which is strong. The Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens holds. However, a significant continuity error mars the closure: after Elias removes the oak chime and Mira removes the maple, the text states "the remaining cedar and oak sang a duet." With only three chimes established, this is logically impossible and muddles the final image of resolution, constituting a notable flaw in an otherwise sound structure.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure builds pressure through repetition and deepening observation, not causal turns. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Lira redefines "vanishing" as "becoming," lands with resonant force, its cost being the weeks of patient struggle, which is explicitly stated on the page. The final image of the spiral pattern provides a clean and earned before/after shift in knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through imagery and reflection. The structure is a clean, single continuous scene leading to a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end, where the meaning of "navigating without moving" is re-framed. The cost—the invalidation of centuries of flawed methodology—is conceptual but legible, and the final image of Kael descending the tower solidifies the "after" state.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens with a strong on-page closure. The progression from entering the spire to activating the keystone and transforming the garden is logical and builds effectively. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing of "sacredness," with the cost being Kael's abandonment of his quest for external validation through grand magic, which is felt in his final, simple joy.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and memory until its Conceptual Repricing (CR) closure. The structure is clean, and the final realization—that sound's color is memory and emotion—provides a legible before/after shift in Elias’s state. The cost is the final acceptance of decades of grief, signified by leaving the key. The coincidence of door "13" is a touch convenient, but acceptable within the story's magical realist frame.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows an effective Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through sensory and informational density rather than strict causality. The structure is clean, moving from problem to investigation to resolution. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where Kael’s internal state crystallizes with the felt cost of shedding his former skepticism. The causal link weakens slightly at the moment of vision, which feels more like a magical leap than a direct result of his process.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and internal pressure toward a ritualistic climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of “sacrifice,” is potent and earned, with the cost felt in the “ache of knowing.” The single-scene structure is perfectly suited to the length, with a clear setup, a focused central action, and a resonant final image that reconfigures the protagonist's state without any structural flaws.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens from setup to resolution. The closure is a well-executed Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the rift isn't permanently healed but is brought into a fragile, temporary balance, a legible change with the felt cost of exhaustion and required vigilance. The structure is perfectly scaled for the word count, moving from problem to attempt to consequence with convincing momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal structure under a hybrid Causal/Accumulative lens. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration where Mara accepts a new role, with the cost being the end of her solitary custodianship of the past. The plot's primary weakness is the convenient, perfectly-timed arrival of Elias’s daughter, which feels slightly mechanical in an otherwise organic story.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story's structure is flawless for its length, operating under a Hybrid lens that moves from Accumulative texture to a tight Causal chain for the ritual. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Elara's internal conflict, lands with a tangible cost—the charred hand—and a resonant final image. The progression is seamless, with a clear setup, a decisive turn, and an earned resolution that achieves a state of Charged Poise for the future.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a tight and effective Causal lens, where each action logically propels the next. The structure is clean, with a clear inciting incident (static clearing) and escalation (finding the second node). The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), lands perfectly on the page, with the conceptual cost of endless vigilance made explicit and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story executes a clean, causal structure with a clear beginning, middle, and end, anchored in a single scene. The closure is a Decisive Change (the clone's destruction and Kael’s integration) with a felt cost (accepting raw emotion and an uncertain future), and the Causal drive lens holds perfectly from the inciting incident to the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a tight causal chain with commendable precision for this length. The inciting incident leads to a series of logical investigative steps, each raising the stakes until the final discovery. The closure is a well-earned Conceptual Repricing (CR)—the realization that the *process* was the puzzle—with a clear conceptual cost of abandoning a purely analytical mindset. The structure is flawless under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly. The structure is an elegant, single-beat crescendo, building pressure through intensifying effort rather than external reversals. The closure is a powerful Decisive Change—the restoration of sound—that lands with a clear and earned emotional and physical cost ("collapsed to his knees, tears streaming down his face"), making the final moment deeply resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean, causal structure culminating in a resonant closure. The final sequence—tossing the pendant, the path’s appearance, and the reunion—functions as both a Decisive Change and a Conceptual Repricing of the story's core ideas. All setups (the pendant's symbols, the mentor's note) pay off precisely, and the cost of the resolution (leaving her post, the nature of the test) is felt, fulfilling the 9+ criteria.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a tight, Causal-dominant structure. The progression from a broken object to a broken self, and the subsequent "vivification" of both, is flawlessly logical. Closure is a Decisive Change with a clearly legible cost ("scarred," "frayed") paid on the page, satisfying the rubric's highest standards.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens. The plot progresses logically from setup (the mission and the shard) to a clear complication (the system's resistance) and culminates in a Decisive Change (the tower's rebirth). The closure lands with a tangible cost—the shard becomes inert and the old systems are destroyed—making the transformation feel earned and irreversible. The final image of the river of light provides resonant confirmation of the change.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure builds density and atmosphere toward a single, decisive moment of Conceptual Repricing. The closure, where Kael facilitates the merge at the cost of his vessel and role, is powerful, on-page, and carries a clear conceptual cost. All causal links, within the story's fantastical logic, are coherent and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes a clean, single-scene structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The central turn—the thread erupting—serves as a decisive intensification that leads to a clear Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands on the page with a felt cost, as Clara’s understanding of reality is permanently altered in a way she finds both "unsettling, yet peaceful," successfully reweighting the story’s premise.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clear, two-shard structure that effectively moves from internal reflection to external application. The selected Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural) lens holds, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Lirael’s internal state shifts from "adrift" to purposeful. The closure lands cleanly with a legible conceptual cost—the acceptance of uncertainty as a core principle of navigation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive. The discovery of the photograph leads directly to the investigation, which culminates in a well-earned climax and a Decisive Change for the client. The closure, where the wife receives the message, provides a felt cost (her single tear) and lands with resonant finality, satisfying the rubric's requirements for an on-page resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless causal chain under a Causal lens, from discovery to descent to climax.

Every element serves this final, resonant beat, demonstrating exceptional structural integrity.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing for its closure. The structure is a single, focused scene that tightens perfectly. The final beat, where Elias reframes "defragmenting" and accepts the digital ghost as a "compass," makes the before/after state change legible with a clear conceptual cost, fully satisfying the requirements for top-tier closure under this lens.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail toward a single, decisive event. The closure is a superb Conceptual Repricing; the final realization and act of renunciation reframe the entire story with a tangible cost. Causality is resonant and emotionally coherent, perfectly suited to the story's aims.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative-to-Causal) drive, building atmospheric pressure that culminates in a series of direct choices with consequences. The closure is a superb example of a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise); Elara is returned to her starting point, but her purpose and the meaning of her key object are irrevocably altered. The on-page cost is the foreclosure of her old identity, made legible in the final sentence.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure effectively toward a legible closure. The final Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost (bled fingers, broken string, crumbled statues). The structure is elegant for its length, though the final beat is slightly weakened by a direct thematic explanation rather than letting the new reality speak for itself.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a clean two-shard structure under an Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The fantastical causality of the storm-bottle is handled consistently, leading to a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration for a closure. The final image lands with a palpable, if fragile, change in the emotional landscape, demonstrating excellent structural control.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure lands effectively, re-weighting the meaning of silence and the halo fragment. However, the transition to the courtyard relies on a slight convenience; while framed as following the wind bells, the character's thought "A wrong turn leads to a hidden oasis" feels imposed and weakens the causal texture of the discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building atmosphere and conceptual weight toward a clear Conceptual Repricing at the climax. The structure is sound for the length. The primary weakness is the lack of legible cost; Eleanor gains profound insight and re-energizes her world without any apparent sacrifice, risk, or trade-off, which softens the impact of her discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive. The structure builds through a repeated pattern (the ritual) until a decisive break (the light pulsing) forces the climax. The closure is a clean Conceptual Repricing on the page: the realization that the quest's object was internal, marked by the cost of her now-empty palette and the cessation of her chase.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes its structure flawlessly under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens. The plot builds atmospheric pressure that pays off in a decisive action, leading to a Conceptual Repricing closure where the cost—the loss of a familiar world and the shouldering of a new burden—is tangible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly constructed on a tight causal chain (dream → new focus → sextant → map → locket → revelation). The drive lens is Causal and holds perfectly through the ending. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to Charged Poise), as Elias’s obsession is reweighted into a sacred purpose, with the cost being this newfound responsibility. The story establishes its fantastic premise and follows its own logic flawlessly to a resonant conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean, Causal structure within a single scene. The inciting incident (woman's arrival) leads directly to a central choice, and the resolution is a Charged Poise (RR) where the woman commits to a costly path. The cost—confronting the past—is explicitly stated and accepted, making the closure resonant and earned for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows an elegant Accumulative/Textural lens, building atmosphere and pressure toward a single causal action. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration: the heirloom seed is lost (a clear cost), but reconfigured into a single blossom and a new understanding, landing the 'after' state with precision and grace. The structure is flawless for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Pressure builds not through a causal chain but through the increasing weight of the "hush," which is made tangible. The structure is clean: a single scene with a clear setup, intensification, and climax. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (RR); Mara's internal state is decisively changed, with the silver key serving as a powerful objective correlative for this shift. The felt cost is legible in the lifting of a burden "she hadn’t known she carried," making the transformation feel earned.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.0)
    The plot is structured cleanly as an accumulative sequence of discoveries leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end, where the meanings of "tear" and "silence" are reconfigured. The primary weakness is the absence of a tangible cost. The resolution is a seamless victory, lacking the sacrifice or trade-off that would give the final revelation more weight and satisfy the rubric's requirement for a felt price.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural drive, culminating in a strong Conceptual Repricing (CR) where "letting go" is reframed as "transmission." Orientation is excellent. However, the causal chain relies on a significant coincidence—the tuning fork and snow globe sharing the exact same frequency—which feels slightly too convenient, nudging the elegant thematic connection toward a mechanical plot device and slightly weakening the otherwise seamless structure.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building emotional weight through the sequence of messages rather than causal plot turns. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the final act of pressing the bluebell reweights the entire ritual from personal catharsis to a gesture of faith. The cost—the vulnerability of releasing his secrets—is subtle but deeply felt in the quiet hope of the final paragraphs.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story structure is excellent, using the elevator's ascent as a physical and narrative clock that builds tension towards a confrontation. The plot unfolds via an Accumulative/Textural lens, with discoveries layering to create a new understanding.

The cost—the shattering of a simpler grief—is felt in the widow's cracking facade.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. It builds pressure not through causal events but through a series of increasingly resonant observations, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing of Lila's entire worldview. The closure, where she redefines her mission, lands with the felt cost of her professional and physical isolation. Orientation is immediate and the structure is elegant and efficient for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=9.7)
    The story exhibits a masterful causal structure within its brief scope. The inferable drive lens is Causal, holding perfectly from the initial discovery to the final choice. The closure, a clear form of Charged Poise, lands with a legible cost (the destruction of the library) and a resonant reconfiguration of Lira's future, making the before/after state undeniable. The pacing and plot mechanics are flawless.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens, with each discovery logically leading to the next. The closure is a Decisive Change, achieved on-page with the leap and its aftermath, and the cost (defiance, physical risk) is clear. The primary weakness is the puzzle's linear progression, which unfolds without significant setbacks or complications, making the resolution feel slightly too straightforward for the highest echelon.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, building atmosphere to a decisive point of action. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Kael's internal state shifts, is earned and lands with a felt cost of solitude and legacy. The final image of the clock ticking provides a perfect, resonant final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean, comprehensible structure under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The threat is established, a plan is enacted, and a resolution is achieved. The closure is a Decisive Change—the arch is saved—earned through the settlers' on-page actions. The cost is the collective effort and the fulfillment of Elara’s purpose, leading to her peaceful fading. The plot is simple but effectively executed, with clear causality from Elara's messages to the community's mobilization.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure builds density through image and memory, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing (CR) at the end. The closure lands on the page with a clear felt cost—the shattering of the pane and the heirloom puppet head—as the concept of "doomsday" is reconfigured into a gentle, flawed lullaby.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Causal drive. The structure is tight, with each beat escalating logically from the one before, from the traveler's cry to the birds' convergence. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis, is masterful; the curse is satisfied "for now," but the cost is made tangible and resonant in the final image of the cracked nut, ensuring the cycle of duty continues.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story's structure is elegant and effective, following a two-shard design (ravine, studio) with a clean transition. The plot operates successfully under an Accumulative/Textural lens, where the build-up of imagery and internal reflection motivates the final turn. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where the sisters find a "shaky harmony," lands on the page with the felt cost of confronting their shared grief.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, successfully building pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing at the end. The structure is clean and effective for the length. The primary weakness is the closure mechanism: the arrival of the musical note is a thematic convenience, a deus ex musica that resolves Elara’s internal conflict without being directly caused by her actions, which slightly softens the impact of her earned insight.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through atmosphere and sensory detail rather than a causal plot chain. The closure is a superb Resonant Reconfiguration; Nessar doesn't defeat the remorse but re-prices it, diluting it by taking it into himself. The cost is clear—he now carries the founder's guilt—and this reconfigures the emotional state of the entire fortress, landing with quiet power in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building a lyrical sequence of actions toward a resonant climax. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands with atmospheric power. However, the plot's causality feels weak in the final beats; the villagers' instant conversion from a long-standing "rift" to harmonious cooperation is unearned and feels more like a magical convenience than a plausible social change, slightly undermining the story's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain under a Causal lens, moving from problem to attempt, complication, and a decisive change at the end. The closure is a clear Decisive Change (the mirror is transformed) with a legible felt cost (his own painful memories are integrated). The structure is perfectly scaled for the word count, demonstrating excellent control of pacing and narrative economy.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates on a clean, compelling causal chain that fits the Causal lens perfectly. The closure, a combination of Decisive Change (gaining the key) and Conceptual Repricing (her new identity), is earned and executed on the page. The felt cost is the burden of her new purpose, which lands effectively in the final lines, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through repeated action toward a resonant final state. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration, lands decisively when the insulator shatters and the grove begins to “sing.” The cost is tangible (the broken relic, her physical pain), and the before/after state of the grove is perfectly clear. The structure is elegant and effective for this length and mode.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story executes a strong Causal/Accumulative hybrid structure, culminating in an on-page Decisive Change with felt cost. Causality is mostly tight, with the nexus's reactions and Alaric's insights forming a clear chain. The primary flaw is the convenience of Lira's key appearing without prior setup; while thematically resonant, its sudden introduction at the precise moment of need functions as a minor deus ex machina, weakening the otherwise earned resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal chain under a Causal lens. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where Lirael’s understanding of silence is fundamentally reweighted, lands with palpable emotional cost. The structure is a tight, single, continuous scene that uses its ~670-word count with excellent efficiency, fulfilling all requirements for this length. The 9+ quick test is satisfied by this on-page closure and persistent lens.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear causal chain under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, culminating in a Decisive Change. The plot is coherent and the closure lands. The primary weakness is the structure, which compresses weeks into a summary, flattening the dramatic tension; the elders' sudden, unanimous change of heart at the end feels overly tidy and convenient, softening the resolution's impact.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story follows a strong, legible Causal lens, with each discovery leading directly to the next. The closure is a valid Conceptual Repricing that redefines the story's central goal. The score is lowered by a significant continuity error in the final paragraphs: the arrow tip is described as having "fused with the pedestal," but in the second-to-last paragraph, it is "cool in her pocket," which undermines the finality of the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building a sense of unease through disparate elements (patch, wind, buzz) that cohere at the end. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing: the world is not just chaotic but potentially malevolent. The primary weakness is the causal leap; the jump from anomalous wind patterns to a sentient, hungry machine relies on the engineer's exposition and a vibrating patch, which feels like a sudden genre shift not fully seeded in the story’s initial grounded reality.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is elegant and effective, following Track C (Multi-POV) with a clean switch that enhances the climax by showing its external impact. The story establishes its anchors clearly and proceeds under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through sensory intensification. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, as the cavern and Veyra are permanently altered, with the cost being the irrecoverable loss of the old, static silence and Veyra's cynical worldview. The causality holds perfectly within its magical framework.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a Hybrid (Causal to Accumulative/Conceptual) structure flawlessly for its length. The causal chain is clear—playing the flute opens a path, which leads to a riddle, which provokes an action, which triggers a crisis. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where silence becomes the true power, lands with a tangible cost (the broken flute) and is demonstrated through a final, decisive action (etching the new rune).

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a tight, logical causal chain where the protagonist's actions directly lead to an unexpected escalation and a decisive change. Closure is achieved through a clear "before/after" transformation for Elias, with the cost being the shattering of his intellectual worldview, made tangible in the chaotic climax. The structure is flawless for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens flawlessly, building pressure through resonant details and atmosphere. The structure is clean and efficient for its length, with a clear setup, escalation, and climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Kail's role from courier to "soil," is executed on the page with a legible cost—the stilled, inert pendant—making for a powerful and satisfying conclusion.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is exemplary for this length, operating on an Accumulative/Textural lens that seamlessly transitions to a Causal climax. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the arbor is revealed as a mirror, lands with significant felt cost—the shattering of Mara's foundational belief. The final beat of Earned Stasis ("her mind at peace") is a perfect, resonant cadence.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) lens, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing where Mara’s relationship to the silence and her craft is redefined. The closure lands with a clear, felt cost—the loss of her grandmother's bead. The inciting incident (the box washing up) relies on coincidence, which is acceptable in a fairy tale but slightly weakens the causal chain for a top-tier score.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive. The structure is tight, moving from setup to a clear inciting incident, and escalating logically to the climax. The closure is an on-page Decisive Change (Jorin taking the orb, healing the land) earned with a visible, felt cost (enduring the shards), satisfying the rubric's core requirements for excellence. The plot is perfectly scaled for the word count, delivering a complete and satisfying arc without any structural ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story's causal structure is exemplary, moving with clear "because/therefore" logic from the inciting incident to the final beat. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, achieved via an on-page choice with a visible cost ("hollow ache," trembling hands) and a tangible reward ("The weight was gone"). The plot adheres perfectly to the Causal lens without a single wasted move.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a flawless Accumulative/Textural drive lens. The structure builds pressure not through causal plot twists but through the repetition and deepening of a quiet ritual. The closure is a powerful Conceptual Repricing: the meaning of "light" is reconfigured from a physical beacon to a form of shared hope. This change lands with the clear, felt cost of the lamp remaining dark, making the final image resonant and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=9.2)
    Following an Accumulative/Textural lens, the structure builds pressure to an effective climax where the prophetic vision intensifies. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), crystallizing the character's new purpose. The conceptual cost—accepting that the coming light is inseparable from a new darkness—is made legible on the page and gives the ending significant weight.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. Orientation is immediate and evocative, and the structure builds pressure through imagery rather than plot turns, culminating in a clean Conceptual Repricing. The closure, marked by the loss of the wing and the gain of a new purpose, lands on the page with a clear, felt cost, making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Pressure builds through atmosphere (storm, pin drops) and the deepening mystery of the sextant, leading to a strong Conceptual Repricing at the end. The final image of Elias stepping through the now-transparent wall into the corridor of glowing roots provides a legible on-page closure with a felt conceptual cost—the acceptance of his endless, meaningful work. The structure is elegant and effective for the story's length and aims.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. Rather than causal turns, the narrative builds through a powerful intensification of imagery and effect, from a single captured melody to a realm-wide revival. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (a form of Charged Poise), where the endless night begins to fray, establishing a new, hopeful state of ongoing renewal. The cost is Lira's exhaustion and continued lonely duty, making the hopeful ending feel earned and grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens effectively, building pressure through a series of symbolic encounters rather than direct causal conflict. The structure is tight and purposeful for its length, leading to a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where the protagonist finds peace. The emotional cost of accepting her vulnerability is legible in the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is clean, moving from discovery to a deepening of engagement. The closure—a Conceptual Repricing of "creeping normality" from a threat to a map—lands with a clear, felt cost: the surrender of Elias's old, anxious quest for a new, sustainable purpose. All causal links are textural and coherent within the chosen lens.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean, causal chain under the Causal lens, leading to a Decisive Change at the end. Orientation is swift and effective. The primary weakness is that the resolution feels slightly out of proportion; successfully reconstructing one vow seemingly refreshes the entire library's magic, which simplifies the stakes and feels a bit too convenient for a flawless landing.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a tight, flawless Causal lens. Every beat logically propels the next, from the initial eavesdropping to the final confrontation. The closure unit—smashing the device and contemplating the damaged fob—is a Decisive Change that lands with a clear, felt cost: the shattering of Lira's idealized memory of her father. This is an expertly structured piece.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=9.4)
    The story uses an Accumulative/Textural lens beautifully, building sensory pressure until the final beat. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing (CR), where Lira’s explanation re-frames the entire premise from sensing people to sensing pivotal moments of world-balance. The cost is the destruction of Kael's skeptical framework, which lands with precision in the final line. The structure is tight, elegant, and serves the concept perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, where atmospheric and symbolic details build pressure toward a Conceptual Repricing at the close. The symbolic causality—a painting creating a shadow-door—is internally coherent and serves the magical-realist mode perfectly. The closure lands with a legible cost (confronting the "auroral sorrow") and an undeniable on-page change, making the structure exceptionally effective for its length.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean and compelling causal structure. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing, is executed flawlessly; the initial goal is rendered impossible, and the protagonist must reframe her understanding of value at a clear emotional cost. The inferred Causal lens holds from the initial clue to the final, reconfigured hope, making the plot feel both surprising and inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The structure is clean: a clear setup, an inciting incident (finding the ice), a development phase (building the sculpture), and a climax tied to a natural clock (the melting). The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration, where the symphony transforms rather than ends, with the cost being the irretrievable loss of the original iceberg-driven performance. The causality is textural, not event-driven, and lands its final image with precision.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=9.5)
    The plot exhibits flawless economy and causality under a Hybrid (Accumulative -> Causal) lens. The accumulating pressure of the magnetic shift and leaking fears logically drives the decisive action of the "controlled burn." The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the protagonist achieves a new, stable state by integrating the conflict's source, with the cost of accepting imperfection made tangible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.8)
    The plot follows a logical, causal structure until the climax. The resolution hinges on a significant causality break: Clara deduces a three-number combination (birth year, enlistment date, marriage year) from vague stories and a faded photo. This leap from fragmented lore to specific data is unearned, making the solution feel convenient rather than cleverly pieced together, which severely undermines the story's core investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story successfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive lens, building a resonant conclusion through layered imagery. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of vulnerability, is potent and earned by the preceding journey. However, the causal logic becomes strained during the climax; the resolution of the drone threat relies on a thematic gesture rather than a plausible cause-and-effect chain established by the story's own rules, slightly weakening an otherwise strong structure.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=6.8)
    The causal chain is coherent (coffee grounds lead to panel, etc.), and the closure is an on-page Decisive Change of purpose. However, the resolution lacks a legible cost under the Causal lens. The gravity pockets "stabilizing, as if in gratitude" is a convenient external fix, not a price paid by Elias, which significantly softens the impact of his discovery and makes the ending feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive lens beautifully, building pressure through atmosphere toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where the haven's peace is secured at the cost of the ritual object, is legible and earned on the page. The structure is clean and effective for the story's length, with a strong before/after state change centered on the brook's sound.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story follows a flawless Causal drive lens. The plot is perfectly structured for its length, moving from mystery to revelation to a decisive final action. The closure, a Decisive Change where the building "answered," lands with significant felt cost—the shudder, the aching teeth—and creates a moment of Charged Poise, reconfiguring the stakes entirely. Every beat logically connects to the next, demonstrating masterful control of pacing and causality.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through imagery and memory toward a single, decisive ritual. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration: the protagonist's internal state is visibly changed ("lighter"), and the cost is made tangible on the page through the destruction of the garden. The lens holds perfectly, and the before/after state is legible and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story masterfully employs an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through layered meaning rather than causal plot turns. The structure is flawless for this mode: a single, continuous scene that flows toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands with a clear felt cost—Lirael’s solitary penance—making the final image powerful and earned.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear and effective Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) structure, moving from ledge to fissure to summit with purpose. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of Kael's purpose, lands with a clear "before/after" state. The final image of the canyon singing in answer provides a resonant cost—the weight of his new understanding—making the structure feel complete and earned within its short scope.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight effectively through the three dream sequences. However, a major causal gap weakens the structure: the method of "analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams" is introduced without any setup or explanation of its mechanics. This convenient, magical leap undermines the plot's integrity, making the subsequent revelations feel unearned.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=9.5)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The narrative builds density through atmosphere, memory, and sensory detail, culminating in a powerful Conceptual Repricing at the end. The closure, where Kael’s understanding of “moon paths” and hidden effort is re-evaluated, lands with a clear, felt conceptual cost on the page, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=9.2)
    The Causal drive is executed flawlessly, with each discovery logically leading to the next beat. The closure is a Decisive Change (sealing the stillpoint) with a clear on-page cost (the mystery of Crane remains, the world is saved). The decoy diamond twist provides an effective tightening right before the final choice, making the structure exceptionally strong for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a strong Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through a series of increasingly specific messages that guide the protagonist. The structure culminates in a clean on-page closure: a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Kael accepts his role as "conductor." The cost is the burden of this new power, crystallizing in the final image of him poised to lead a chaotic "new dawn," making the before/after state perfectly legible.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=9.1)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly. The structure (loft-village-loft) provides a satisfying frame for the emotional journey. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's acceptance of his new purpose ("not to be remembered, but to remember")—which is earned on the page with a clear, conceptual cost.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.0)
    The story follows a clean and effective causal chain under the Causal lens. The closure is a Decisive Change, with the stabilization of the key and pacification of the ghost landing with a clear, felt cost ("Elias collapsed to his knees"). The ghost's rapid change of heart is compressed but remains plausible within the story's logic of harmonic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through observation and precise action. The closure is an excellent example of a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the viaduct's hum and Kael's internal state are realigned with a clear felt cost (the night of painstaking labor, the shedding of haste). The structure is elegant and perfectly scaled for the word count, holding the lens consistently through the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.5)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, and the closure—a Charged Poise—is effective. The primary weakness is a significant causality gap: the protagonist's jump to "Director Cole. He’d known about the lantern’s power. He’d *used* it to keep her compliant" is not sufficiently supported by prior events. This unearned epistemological leap feels like a shortcut that weakens the structural integrity of the central turn.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story follows a clean, Causal lens structure. Orientation is swift and effective, and the progression from doubt to understanding to resolution is logical. The closure is a Decisive Change in Marcus's stance, with the cost being the shift from detached observer to committed participant. The final image is resonant, but slightly weakened by a fuzzy causal link in the phrase "turn the warden’s apology into action," which conflates the inmate's apology (the heart) with the warden's program.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    The story follows a tight, elegant causal structure. Each discovery logically enables the next attempt, culminating in a well-earned climax. The closure is a superb example of Conceptual Repricing: Lira achieves her goal, but the outcome—a "hum," not a "ring"—redefines the nature of her quest and its success. The implied cost of the glider's crash provides a sufficient physical price for the achievement.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story employs a clean and effective Causal drive. The plot progresses logically from clue to clue, building momentum toward the climax. The closure is a well-executed Charged Poise, establishing clear stakes and a reconfigured future with a felt cost (imminent capture) without needing to show the aftermath. The structure is tight and serves the short form perfectly.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is clean and purposeful: a threat is introduced, a ritual accumulates emotional weight, and a final image reconfigures the state of the conflict. The closure is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where the storm's nature is altered rather than defeated. The cost—Elara's absorption of collective trauma—is felt through the ritual, making the final moment of peace earned and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clear Hybrid (Accumulative/Causal) drive, building an atmospheric stasis that is broken by a causal event. The structure is efficient and well-suited for the length. Closure is achieved through a Resonant Reconfiguration (a shift in internal state), which lands on the page with a legible, albeit subtle, cost—the piercing of her protective numbness. The inciting incident (hearing the sound) is slightly coincidental but serves the situational pressure of the narrative effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story operates effectively under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building emotional weight toward a clear Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where Lila's perspective shifts, lands cleanly with a felt conceptual cost—the abandonment of her quest for perfection. The structure is simple but flawless for its length, with orientation and causality handled elegantly within the single scene.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows a clean, single-scene structure under a hybrid causal/accumulative lens. The arrival of the prophet enables the central action, which unfolds with its own mystical logic. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where the wisdom is preserved “for now,” is exceptionally clear, on-page, and carries a felt cost of effort and ongoing duty.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is an excellent example of the Accumulative/Textural lens. It builds pressure not through causal events but through a layering of resonant images—arcs, vines, the dove—that lead to an on-page Resonant Reconfiguration of Lila's perspective. The closure, where she realizes the masterpiece is already complete and writes "enough," is a potent internal shift with a felt cost: the release of a long-held, burdensome goal. The final action of returning with film confirms the decisiveness of this change.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.9)
    The structure is excellent under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building from a clear inciting incident (the crystal falling) to a resonant closure. The final decision to "testify" is a strong Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with a clear, felt future cost—the loss of his protective silence. Orientation and progression are handled with professional control.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure, building pressure through mood and repetition rather than causal plot turns. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), where Elias renounces his old goal with a visible on-page action that redefines his relationship to his "gift." The cost—a life lived in fragments—is made legible and accepted, resulting in a powerful and coherent ending.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.2)
    The story follows a Causal lens, but the linkages rely heavily on unearned epiphanies. Key turns—like the realization "By the sound of a leaf falling"—arrive as sudden insights rather than deductions forced by prior events. While the closure is a clear Decisive Change with felt cost, the "because/therefore" chain leading to it feels weak, as if the protagonist is receiving plot instructions rather than solving a problem.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias finds peace and the vinyl shard is passed on, lands with clear, felt cost. The simple, single-scene arc builds emotional pressure effectively without any causal missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The causal structure is exceptionally clean and logical, with a strong because/therefore progression from setup to resolution. The story passes the Orientation Test with ease. However, the closure—a Decisive Change in knowledge—lacks a visible or felt cost as required by the rubric's Cost proof test, making the otherwise well-structured plot feel frictionless and less impactful at the moment of discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story follows a clean, causal structure. (Drive Lens: Hybrid, Causal dominant at closure). The inciting goal (set the tooth) leads directly to the complication (Elias's return), which forces the climax (the dual-tooth ritual). The closure is a strong Decisive Change and Resonant Reconfiguration: the fountain flows, and Mara's understanding of the world is irrevocably altered. The cost—the loss of her protective skepticism and the embrace of painful truths—is clearly felt, making the resolution satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The plot advances not through external reversals but through an intensification of memory and sensory detail, culminating in a perfect Resonant Reconfiguration. The closure, where Elara releases the pearl, provides a legible cost and recontextualizes her entire journey, landing with undeniable force.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story operates under a strong Accumulative/Textural lens, building pressure through imagery rather than plot twists. The structure is elegant: a quiet waiting period followed by a single, transformative conversation. The closure is a potent Resonant Reconfiguration, where the final image of the modified pendant reweights Lila's entire relationship to her grief, landing with a clear, felt cost—the acceptance of change over static preservation.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=9.5)
    The structure is flawless for its purpose, using a two-shard design (nexus journey, study action) to create a powerful before/after effect. The chosen Accumulative/Textural drive lens is held perfectly; the nexus scene builds pressure through imagery and atmosphere, leading to a potent Conceptual Repricing of "endings." The on-page closure—deleting the chapter—is a decisive change with a clear cost, satisfying the 9+ test. Orientation is immediate and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly, building pressure through lyrical density toward a clear climax. The closure is an elegant Resonant Reconfiguration, where the arbor's state is transformed and the protagonist's purpose is repriced with a new, ongoing responsibility. The cost—the spent tendril and Lira's exhaustion—is legible and proportionate, making the ending feel earned and satisfying.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.2)
    The structure is elegant and effective, following an Accumulative/Textural drive that builds pressure through a meticulous ritual, culminating in a Causal climax. The closure is a potent Conceptual Repricing ("the map was not just a guide to the stars—it was a guide to the heart") that lands with a clear felt cost—the years of failure and the physical toll of the ritual. The story maintains perfect orientation and scope, delivering a complete and resonant arc within its word count.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story demonstrates a masterful, concise structure. The causal chain from problem (broken timer) to process (reverse-engineering) to resolution (harvest restored) is flawless. The Decisive Change at the end lands with a clear conceptual cost, fulfilling the closure requirement under a Hybrid (Causal/Accumulative) lens without any structural missteps.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural drive, building pressure through atmosphere and the escalating difficulty of Kael's task, rather than a causal chain. The structure is perfectly suited to the length, focusing on a single, ritualistic process. The closure, a form of Earned Stasis where Kael accepts his own burden, is a resonant and costly reconfiguration of his stance, landing with significant emotional weight.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=9.6)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens flawlessly, building emotional pressure through reflection and the physical act of carving. Orientation is immediate and clear. The closure is a powerful Resonant Reconfiguration, where the final image of the lion reprices the meaning of loss into a form of endurance. The cost—the permanence of absence, now contained—is deeply felt, making the structure and its quiet resolution exceptionally effective.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes a flawless Accumulative/Textural structure. The closure, a Resonant Reconfiguration where Veyra achieves Earned Stasis from her internal struggle, lands with a powerful, felt cost: the release of her past, symbolized by the camera wheel. The final image of the rose is a perfect conceptual repricing of the lagoon's nature, shifting from a place of haunted memory to one of quiet rebirth.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=9.2)
    The plot is elegantly structured with a clean, causal drive that holds through the end. The closure is a superb example of Charged Poise: Lila leaves not with a final answer but with a new, testable hypothesis and the burden of validating it, a cost made legible in the final image. The story perfectly utilizes its short form to execute one meaningful reconfiguration of the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=9.2)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural structure flawlessly, building pressure through atmosphere and imagery rather than plot mechanics. The ending provides a superb Resonant Reconfiguration, as Lira’s understanding of her life is fundamentally altered. The final line, "in the silence between beats, where dreams breathe," lands with conceptual cost, repricing her entire existence within the keep.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.8)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal drive, moving from the initial riddle on the barge to the discovery in the warehouse. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing where the sundial's purpose is re-contextualized, is earned and lands with a felt, if subtle, cost ("the weight of revelation settling in his chest"). The structure is tight, well-paced for its length, and all causal links are sound, making for a very strong architectural foundation.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=9.2)
    The narrative structure is elegant and highly effective, operating under a Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant) lens. It establishes a clear goal, introduces a key, demonstrates a successful test, and then uses an external catalyst to trigger a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure. The final realization—that the "loom" is a concept—lands with a palpable felt cost: the loss of a tangible, mythical goal in exchange for a profound, lifelong responsibility. The causality is flawless within its chosen mode.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.9)
    The story executes an Accumulative/Textural drive flawlessly. The structure is simple but potent: setup, a single deepening beat (the vision), and a resonant closure. The closure, a Conceptual Repricing of her work, lands with a clear "before/after" state of understanding and a palpable emotional cost—the acceptance of "lonesome splendor."

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.5)
    The story follows a clean and effective Causal lens; Corvin’s focused actions directly precipitate the story’s climax. The structure is sound for its length, moving from setup to a clear tightening (the egg’s keening) and culminating in a Decisive Change. The closure lands with a legible cost—the acknowledgment of a “flawed” and “imperfect” new beginning—but the sudden appearance of Elder Thalos feels slightly convenient, a minor contrivance in an otherwise earned resolution.

The cost is legible in her "tempered" nature, making the structure feel complete and resonant.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.8)
    The story follows a clear Causal lens, but the central causal mechanism is critically ambiguous. The narrative claims the thaw is achieved through "observation, calculation" and "not through magic," yet the act of writing the future manifests it directly, which reads as magical.

Causal linkage holds—broken needle → copper wire → reversed vinyl → hush that dissolves numbness. Orientation is clear by line 3; one legible transition (days pass) fits scope.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.2)
    The inferred lens is Causal; the because/therefore chain holds from trembling recorder → pigeon → rooftop detour → biohazard alarm → decisive exit. Closure arrives as an earned renunciation (burning the note) with felt cost: the courtyard’s “quiet endorsement” after forfeiting solitude lands cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final inhalation reweights prior scent-aversion into acceptance with felt cost (“grateful for the chance to grieve”). Causal chain—vial → UV reveal → memory flood → stance shift—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; no breaks, one seamless scene.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the spiral of unraveled rope reweights earlier motifs under an Accumulative/Textural lens; causality holds, though the energy-being’s guidance edges toward convenient oracle.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the silence is reweighted from wall to threshold. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each note thickens the pattern until the bowl glows. The cost is visible in the crowd’s tentative murmur, but the causal linkage between bowl and transformation could be one degree sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias shelves the used petal, the grotto’s hum subsides, and the half-truth business quietly reconfigures—cost is the perpetual readiness for the next client. Causal chain holds: dusk static → petal test → sale → reset. Orientation is immediate; no teleporting props. The lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of scent, light, and static builds to a final cadence shift rather than a causal reversal.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.1)
    Locket delivery → friendship rekindled → sympathetic ripple forms a tidy causal yarn; closure lands quietly (forged praise envelope), earning Clara’s earned risk of civic deception with felt social cost under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reveal that Lira is Veyra crystallizes the stake of kinship and leaves the shared ache as visible cost. Causal chain holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the orchard’s thinning visitors is asserted rather than dramatized, muting the before/after contrast.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lila re-enters normal time clutching new knowledge and a charged sketch, the cost being the irreversible glimpse of borrowed moments. Causal chain holds—pendant twist → tunnel → re-entry—though the “uncage” instruction resolves more by oracle fiat than earned logic.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a crystallized Resonant Reconfiguration: the chips dovetail into starlight, making ambiguous loss legible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—every drip, fissure, and pulsing fruit tightens until Elara’s stance crystallizes with visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern of tape fragments, caches, and hush builds density until the decoder’s hum crystallizes stakes. Closure is a Charged Poise—Mara’s stance reconfigured from ghost to messenger with visible cost (cache secrecy, future risk). Orientation anchored by 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.1)
    The piece closes on a clear Resonant Reconfiguration: Eleanor’s choice “to help them by releasing control” crystallizes both stance and method with felt professional/story cost (her nursery will henceforth look nothing like her original plan). Causality remains consistent under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat builds the pattern of letting-go until the ending reweights everything. One minor ellipsis: how the nursery will financially survive total relinquishment goes undramatized, but the closure retains its charge.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.7)
    Ambiguous through midpoint, but closure is a subtle Resonant Reconfiguration: the painting shifts from "tomb" to "bridge," reweighting the entire premise. Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—the amber pigment literally changes what emerges on the canvas. Cost is concrete in the relinquished insomnia and new, quieter listening stance.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the cave’s song re-stabilizes but now carries the “unpredictable hum” inside Elara, a felt cost. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory intensification reweights the stake of control vs. surrender. Orientation is clear by line 4; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.2)
    Staggered-interval revisits create a cumulative accretive frame; causality is loose (Memories surface because Lirael “waits”), yet the rhythm tightens options toward the final reunion of valve and trumpet with discernible closure resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    The crack-arrows and ticket show one meaningful tightening: they compress vast preparation into a single slot that forecloses safer routes. Closure lands cleanly—the hologram re-weights but does not force a new act, so pressure stalls just before 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tile acts as a clear causal bridge between past and present; Aelia’s memories arrive with demonstrable cost (Clara’s shock, physical reaction) and the closure image—inked patterns aligning with the stars—earns its resonance through prior cause.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the amulets shatter and the escondite collapses, reweighting eternity into possibility. Causal chain (storm → field disruption → release) is legible; one transition from corridor to sideways-gravity chamber is clean. Orientation is established by ~110 words. Cost is felt in the void, though slightly diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: asylum papers + ink pot = new path, cost is the scroll’s surrender. Causal lens holds—each beat because/therefore. Orientation is swift; prep-room anchors by line 3. One minor slack: agents’ instant stand-down feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each dawn session layers texture until the lamp’s pulse reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—Althea clutches the thickened notepad—but the cost (what she forfeits by continuing) remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is cleanly Resonant Reconfiguration—the locket photo renames the protagonist and redraws prior fragments as clues. Causal linkage remains accumulative: fragments stitched into story after event rather than because/therefore propelling action earlier. One meaningful tightening achieved when past is reclaimed, but pressure is atmospheric rather than driven by choice narrowing.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing staff in dust reweights the premise from “decode” to “feel.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of hum, shell, and memory tightens until the final image. One causal wobble: the dials jump from 11:59 to 12:00 without on-page trigger, a minor ellipsis that doesn’t break the lens but keeps the score under 9.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: because vendors encode graffiti, therefore Lira translates it into a map, which forces Council retreat. Closure is Earned Stasis—carnival saved but fight continues—cost felt in Lira’s pocketed chip and lingering tension.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly as Charged Poise: the gas spiral and archival shadow crystallize the cost of human persistence against automated erasure. Causal chain is tight—dawn triggers the grain, drones arrive, photo endures—though the drones’ timing is convenient rather than driven by her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the ship ascends, the drones fly true, and Lira returns to the next broken thing—an earned stasis that forecloses rest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Causality is intact; no teleporting props or soft resets. Orientation is anchored within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rivers’ source reframed from water to light reweights the premise. Causal chain holds—falcon → map → trek → shard—yet the cost (half-buried in snow) is more reported than embodied, keeping it shy of 9.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the town’s reawakening is felt, and Kael’s exit under the lingering tone supplies cost. Causality is lyric-accumulative rather than strict because/therefore, but the pattern is taught early and held.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the hush shatters into voices, then resolves into a single clear note—Mara’s stance crystallizes with the cost of relinquishing the temple’s archive. Causal linkage holds: scent triggers memory → memory reveals purpose → release dissolves prison. No orientation debt; anchors (who/where/when) are clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias rewrites the inherited story, foreclosing the path of mere repetition. The lattice’s shift from key to pen is the decisive image; cost is the chamber’s dissolution and the reef’s exposed maw. Causal chain holds: father’s lies → Elias enters → lattice teaches → Elias writes. Orientation is anchored early by “lighthouse prison’s air” and “jagged reef.”

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bead’s dissolution reweights the premise and frees both spirits. Causal chain holds (fruit → bead → vortex → dawn), but the pivotal moment is narrated rather than enacted, muting cost.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the merged plates and glowing threads reconfigure the labyrinth from ruin to hymn with visible cost—the plates empty, the canyon lightening. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each stitched thread increases luminous density until the final cadence shift. One minor ellipsis—how the plates’ emptiness feeds the tide pools—keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.0)
    Closure crystallizes as Resonant Reconfiguration—sun-dial tone + villagers arriving—yet beats hinge more on textured lyric than causal pivot; “because Lirael placed the stone, therefore” linkage is muffled. Pressure tightens by atmospheric shimmer rather than narrowing choices, fitting Accumulative lens. Cost is suggested in “it’s enough,” felt on page but lightly sketched; no constraint recurs to charge tactics. Orientation is anchored early—orchard bones, sundial base cue scene, time stable.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s choice to perpetuate her grandmother’s resistance reweights the arcade from marketplace to living archive. Causal chain—chalk fragment → fountain key → hologram—tightens options without gaps. Orientation is anchored by word 50. No retroactive fixes.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the spiral galaxy unravels into a straight line under the candle, reweighting the premise that “truth is never a straight line.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the final shimmer reconfigures meaning. Cost is felt in the risk of exposure, though not yet paid. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shard’s dulled edges and the spirits’ final “Go. Live. Speak.” crystallize a stance shift with felt cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of condensation letters intensifies until moonset reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the coral becomes a talisman that reweights the peace talks. Causal chain holds—each reflection on the cast’s codes tightens Lira’s resolve until she risks the gesture. Cost is legible in the delegates’ silence and her own softened ache.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s undeveloped “film” is developed, reweighting the district from lost to found. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of light, laughter, and memory increases until the fog thins. Causality is intact: because Lira displays the fragment, therefore the crowd revives, therefore she commits to a larger mural. Cost is legible in her trembling hands and the irreversible breach of silence.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the mural reseals, the coin is pocketed, and the garden’s hum becomes a felt rhythm. Causal chain (coin → reflected sound → awakened memory) holds; the cost is the irreversible shift from certainty to curiosity.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: key phrase → proof test → seed → glowing garden. Closure is a decisive change—public bioluminescent protest now exists—with conceptual cost (surveillance risk). One transition (greenhouse → garden) is clean. Orientation is anchored by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.2)
    Steady accretive lens held to closure; timeline anchor drifts early but resets before final. Bloom-question ties to earned stillness image.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.2)
    The story opens with clear spatial and temporal anchors within the first 120 words (opal library, post-storm). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the repaired chime’s altered song reweights the meaning of preservation itself, with the felt cost that the library must now live with imperfect, evolving memory. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of sensory detail and pattern of orchid response tighten until the final cadence shift. No orientation debt or lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each translation breakthrough (“because” of cross-referenced promise) tightens the emotional noose, culminating in the decisive call that reconfigures silence into invitation. Closure lands on-page with the felt cost of admitting past cowardice. One minor causality hiccup—Henrik’s sudden key gift feels slightly convenient—caps the score.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands cleanly: the decrypted confession reweights the floodgate metaphor and Lira’s purpose. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (adhesive, chain, breath) tightens until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in the line “I fear my heart will break, but I trust you to mend it,” which reframes her future burden.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias forecloses the safety of anonymous delivery and steps into the unknown, cost legible in the fading bookshop smell. Causal chain holds—anonymous note → dust-map → dream → decision—under a Causal lens. One transition (attic → street) is clean. Orientation is anchored by skylight and pigeon within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the light-door appears because Lira rewrites the code, crystallizing the “necessary distance” motif into an irreversible step. Causal lens holds—each prism alignment, logbook entry, and grain reading tightens toward the final crossing. The drifting terrace’s rule-set stays consistent; no late cheats.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara’s realization that belonging is a journey, not a destination—charged by the shared exhale and the fading bioluminescence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern intensifies, then subsides, reweighting the premise. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the pool’s image reweights the premise, showing paths vanish by choice not forgetting. Accumulative lens holds—each shard/seed layer deepens pattern until the final ripple reframes memory as release. Cost is felt in Lira’s softened gloom, though the beat is quiet.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is tight: Lira’s pattern-driven melody guides the crowd to the fountain, and the clown’s mechanical stutter supplies the micro-turn that crystallizes the moment. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the arcade’s breath held, then released—with the bishop piece vibrating as the visible anchor of intent.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.9)
    The closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the verse appears on her skin, and she chooses voluntary exile, “a tide dancer in a garden of stars.” Causality is Accumulative/Textural: the dance, dust, and writing escalate into a single irrevocable image. The drive lens holds through, yet a faint hint of cost is delivered more by image than by tangible burden on the final page; this keeps the score just under 8.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.3)
    Single scene holds causal tension: prism ritual → pattern reading → reflection shift. Orientation is clear; climax lands a gentle yet legible resonant reconfiguration via sunrise image and notebook note, though cost is more mood than consequence.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final whispered “I hear you” crystallizes a new stance toward pain and forest. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (moonlight, frost, sand) intensifies until the cadence shift at dawn. Cost is felt in the relinquishing of self-punishment, though the causal chain is more atmospheric than because/therefore.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.9)
    Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the grotto’s physical rules expand thread-by-thread; the final reprise (needle now pointing to a personal coordinate) provides a Resonant Reconfiguration re-weighting “altitude” into meaning. Causality holds: pattern-testing because pressure rises; the cost Elara accepts is the literal loss of her own hair, a visible toll. Yet the one-scene arc is a single tightening of discovery; a second tightening beat would have pushed this toward 7.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory layer (ivy, ash, whisper) thickens until the corridor’s groan reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lira accepts the burden, cost legible in the warm locket and whispered “You are the map.” Orientation anchored by word 80; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the mirrors stabilize, the song ends, and the terrace “remembers” while possibilities root elsewhere. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mirror’s glow layers density until the final cadence shift. Cost is legible in her heaving chest and the drained locket, though the conceptual price could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal chain is clean: dawn arrival → delegate arrival → heat lull → treaty signed → stasis at dusk. Closure lands in the quiet “price of redemption” image, the clipboard scar beneath the celestial slow dance. Minor synoptic exposition at <120 words is waived—orientation is anchored by gesture and shadow.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the egg is released, water poured, and the philanthropist walks away, leaving the reader to weigh the irreversible loss against the lingering echo. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each beat layers density until the final image reweights the premise. No orientation debt; the salt flat is anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sanctuary opens and the echoes are released, reconfiguring Lirael’s stance from burdened to unburdened. Causality is lyrical rather than strict—her dance loosens threads—but the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds and the cost (her breath, the cold, the solitude) is visible. Orientation is clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the reversed projection reconfigures meaning and forecloses the old “smooth lies” path. Causal chain holds—argument hush → raw audience → flipped show—but the lens tilts Accumulative/Textural rather than pure Causal, and the cost is more conceptual than visceral.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the monarch’s ascent reconfigures Lirael’s stance, and the lattice’s inevitable dissolution is the felt cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density of silk, wing, light, and breath accrue until the final image reweights the premise. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causality is airtight: because Kael aligns each braid to the card’s pattern, therefore the rope ignites and the aurora fractures, materially summoning Lira. Closure lands on the page as a resonant reconfiguration—memory made light—whose conceptual cost (forgiveness of self = irreversible absence of mother) is undeniable.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s stance crystallizes into “architect of the directive,” with the wafer-seal emblem now a compass; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm, seal, dream fragments layer until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is legible in her choice to walk out and let the bunker decay.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the tile becomes a mirror, reframing her quest as self-covenant. Causal chain holds—tile as key → chamber → mirror—though the disembodied voice edges on convenient oracle. Cost is legible in her lighter steps and the word “Asharu.”

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Charged Poise: the pin reappears in Kael’s hand, crystallizing the lesson with felt cost. Causality is causal-lite—each visitor’s release follows the same ritual beat—but the final image reconfigures meaning cleanly. Orientation is clear by 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sextant’s reversed gears reweight the premise from erasure to navigation, with the cost of perpetual vigilance implied in Elias’s new mirror. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each mirrored breath layers density until the final image reframes the rule-set. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The stranger’s exit is slightly elliptical, but the reconfigured sextant keeps the beat legible.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard blooms because Lira mends the eye with literal starlight and copper, a visible before/after. Causal chain holds—cracked eye → mending → orchard revival—though the breach itself is reported rather than dramatized. Orientation is swift; cathedral rafters and mossy nest are anchored within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=7.5)
    Nonlinear legacy means every step tightens from blank → shell → tree-map → legacy-fusion; gaps are intentionally elliptical (Accumulative lens), and the closure reconfigures legacies of time via choice, with felt reverence.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s “willingness to embrace the unknown” crystallizes in the step across the mirrored threshold, cost paid by relinquishing certainty. Causal chain holds—diary gaps → cipher key → guardian test → passage—though the ellipsis “Hours later (or was it days?)” lightly blurs temporal causality without harming legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the meadow appears only after Lira chooses remembrance over denial, paying with the ship’s dissolution. Causal chain holds—emerald card → lullaby → door → seed → garden—each step narrowing options. Fog’s parting is earned, not coincidental.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the corridor and scroll reweight her role, and the return to the humming room shows a before/after stance. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; the seal-rope-door braid pattern is taught early and pays off in the glowing corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the caves’ song is reborn in duet with hush, and the energy beings are re-contextualized rather than banished. Causality is lyric-accumulative; each crack-pattern examination thickens texture until the spiral releases the bloom. Orientation is swift; stakes compress elegantly within the word count. Cost is felt in the mapkeeper’s creaking joints and the irrevocable tonal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the prism’s song re-opens the sky, cost paid in blood and solitude. Causal chain—shard → alignment → storm-refraction → rekindling—holds without gaps. Orientation is immediate; mosaic shards are legible transitions. One tightening beat suffices for 600–800 words.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single continuous scene; orientation anchored by ~120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lirael’s lighter steps and the crystal’s approving hum crystallize her new stance with visible cost—the archive’s authority is relinquished. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the blooming lilies reweight “shadows” into latent potential, and the cost—accepting the children’s scars as permanent context—is legible in the final image of upward fire.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density of tide, cicada, starlight patterns reweights the relational stalemate. Closure is a Charged Poise—the altered cicada placement crystallizes options and felt cost without resolving the argument outright. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration: the porcelain loss → green sprout reweights the gilded hush into living, rootward hope with visible conceptual cost. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: image-density increases (doll-float, vine-grasp, final sprout) reconfigure the dominant stake from collecting silence to seeding future quiet. Causality however loosens in the middle beat; the sprout’s emergence feels associative, not logically compelled by inversion physics or her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the density of noise–silence contrasts steadily reframes the goal. Escalation is a cadence shift—the storm glass’s abrupt stillness—rather than causal reversal, leading to the resonant reconfiguration (“the quiet had always been waiting”). Spatial and temporal anchors are clear by 5th paragraph. No causality leakage; closure meets RR with felt conceptual cost (need to revise ferry routes). A hairline slip: could feel slightly outline-dense near middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands cleanly: the throne as mirror reconfigures the quest from external to internal, with the collapsing stairway as on-page cost. Causal chain holds—flake → murals → hollow tree → ascent → revelation—though the guardian’s trial is resolved by a single question rather than a tested choice, slightly thinning causality.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the threshold’s pulse and the hand-clasp reconfigure the sanctuary’s balance with felt cost; the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density of starlight/ash motifs tightening to the final heartbeat image.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure is clean; orientation anchors by ~100 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—turning the bolt dissolves the diamonds and reconfigures the farm’s pressure—yet the causal chain from bolt to diamond dissolution is lightly sketched rather than rigorously earned. Cost is legible but diffuse.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the dynasty’s end is reweighted from tragedy to deliberate sacrifice, with the felt cost of Lirael’s tears. Causal chain (crank → standing waves → hidden letters) holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; each turn deepens pattern rather than reverses plot. Orientation is anchored by 120-word mark. No teleporting props or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse dissolves, Cedric re-embodies in violet light, and the program’s blank page reweights the premise. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and cadence shift rather than strict because/therefore—but the lens is taught early and held. Orientation is secure by 120 words. One minor ellipsis: the “patterns” rule is asserted more than dramatized before the staircase opens.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias re-labels the unknown, crystallizing a stance of archival witness. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dust patterns and button weight accumulate until meaning re-weights the premise. Causality is loose but coherent under this lens; the final image carries conceptual cost (the ache of endless stories). One scaffold line (“He began to unfurl the story…”) is summary rather than dramatized beat, slightly dulling the turn.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: infiltration → key → tunnel → terminal → escape; the relay-station explosion supplies a decisive change with felt cost (files copied, station lost), satisfying closure under a Causal lens.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Elias’s refusal to let the prophecy finish forecloses the path of knowledge, with the cost of perpetual vigilance legible in the final image of the grotto “waiting.” Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; prism atrium’s color shift reweights the stake. Minor ellipsis around the figure’s origin is purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the moonstone dissolves, Elinor’s stance crystallizes, and the arbor’s hush becomes charged poise. Causal chain holds—dust prod → monuments → legible leaves → action plan—though the storm and Lirael remain off-page. Cost is felt in the irreversible loss of the dust and the burden of new knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spinning compass reweights the premise, the cost is the abandonment of certainty, and the causal lens holds from map to garden.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causal arc: coin-drop → vortex → apparition → renunciation. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with felt cost (empty hand, extinguished glow). Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens drift.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the laughter becomes feeling, reweighting the gorge from dread to hope. Causal chain holds—dream → gorge → keeper → translation → reconfiguration—with no unmotivated leaps. Cost is legible in the “luminous ache” that replaces the earlier chill.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elias releases the tree yet keeps the strap, reconfiguring survival from formula to open question. Causal chain holds—UV spores, proprioceptive flare, woman’s touch tighten options toward the final step. Cost is legible in the burning spores and the retained mask.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pattern of sensory density tightens toward the mural beat; closure is a Charged Poise—fragment’s weight reconfigures meaning. One transition (market → mural) is clean. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality break.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: dust patterns, cracks, and ghost flickers tighten toward the hidden compartment reveal. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—ghosts dissolve, office “less lonely”—with conceptual cost legible in Elias’s shaking legs and tight chest.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the library’s cage becomes a maelstrom, cost visible in the shuddering shelves and dispersing whisper. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (frost, press rhythm, spiral) tightens until the rupture reweights meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the shard reweighted from relic of glory to map of crimes, fungi blooming as undeniable CR with conceptual cost; causal chain (cover mirrors → stabilize storm → expose truth) holds under Causal lens; one transition (storm night → dawn) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each adjustment because/therefore alters the stone’s response until Lira’s truth-telling triggers the decisive tonal shift. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—box plays the “truth” not the lullaby—cost is Lira’s shame made audible; no causality breaks, though Elias’s stake stays abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira leaves the threshold unmapped, the compass now still; the lagoon hum becomes her new ambition. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—each beat layers mystery and reweights stakes until the final charged image. Pattern holds cleanly and reconfigures her stance at cost.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=7.8)
    The closure lands cleanly: Lira steps back through the archway with re-imagined purpose, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her art as “maps” of time. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each slide image layers stakes until the final crystallization. The Orientation Test is met within the first 120 words, and the single transition through the portal is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the pavilion murals invert time/space, reweighting the premise with visible conceptual cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern intensification across seasons and glass layers. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no lens ambiguity. One transition (winter→summer) is handled cleanly. Minor causality gap: how the etchings “rewrite photosynthesis” remains asserted, not dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara survives but forfeits the codex, diary erased—cost is legible. Causal chain holds (diary → lagoon → tunnels → trapdoor), though the Society man’s sudden appearance edges coincidence. Orientation is clear by 120 words; lens is Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the amber bottle becomes a lens, the cove re-awakens, and Elias’s stance crystallizes with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each artifact threads memory until the final cadence shift—but a causal gap remains in how the bottle’s warmth actually triggers the revival.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s held breath and Voss’s resolve crystallize the stakes without resolving the coming “scream.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density (wax grooves, foghorn silence, harmonic hum) reweights meaning. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no causality breaks. Cost is felt in the final image: he will “listen,” not prevent.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    The story establishes Accumulative/Textural drive—spirals, seeds, entropy—and fulfills it with Renegotiated Stasis: root-to-sapling reconfigures entropy-debt into renewal. Spatial/temporal anchors land cleanly before demand sharpens.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the bell’s new rhythm restores balance, and the cost—storms arriving sooner—is visible in the churning clouds. Causal chain holds from glue-dampened thud to harmonic duet, though the sundial’s shadow could anchor time more sharply.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a quiet Resonant Reconfiguration: the lantern’s dimmed glow plus captured stardust crystallizes Zara’s stance with felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of silence and light reweights the premise—but the middle lacks a tightening beat that forecloses an option.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene arc driven by situational pressure: ghost visitations tighten until the covenant resolves through Elias’s spoken release of trapped voices, a resonant reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Closure lands cleanly with on-page cost—shattered glass and dissipated ghosts—anchored by prior causal set-up.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the urn fragment reweights the premise, making time’s texture legible without clocks. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each catalogued object thickens the pattern until the final image crystallizes. One transition (entry to hatch) is clean; causality intact.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a gentle Resonant Reconfiguration: the tapestry will dissolve, yet the act of creation is affirmed. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—storm debris is gathered, woven, and released—though the kite-string snap functions more as echo than causal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s pulse syncs with the oak, a visible before/after. Causal chain—copper wire conducts earth’s pulse, spirit accepts bridge—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is palpable in Lira’s final exhale, felt by orchard and reader.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure is earned: the amber mist activates, Lirael’s skepticism unravels, and a door creaks in literal and symbolic re-opening. Chain of causality is clean: amber → sculptures → mist → longing → open door. One minor elasticity comes from Kael’s “chemistry” exposition standing in for deeper stakes that should have narrowed choices in-scene—still, the lens is coherent (Causal). Orientation anchors (“spring drizzle,” “tower loomed”) appear early; transition from mud footprints to stone figures is legible and unambiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the garden’s tiny flames against the storm reconfigure meaning with felt cost (time, risk, memory). Causal chain is slim—scattering seeds because birds ask—but the Accumulative/Textural lens holds via cadence shift and deepening color. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the autumn leaf’s re-display crystallizes communal memory with felt social cost—distance is now bridged. Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each cylinder adds density until the final riddle reweights the stake. Orientation is clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: “true north isn’t a place… it’s a willingness to move.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (warped stars, humming compass, ink smear) reweights the stake until the final step through the golden door feels inevitable. One causal wobble: the glimpse’s persistence is attributed to “abandoned core reactors spasming,” a retro-fact that slightly dilutes on-page causality.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain holds: sky anomaly → ward decay → swap ritual → restored balance. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—stars re-align, Kael’s stance shifts from thief to guardian—yet the cost is cosmic rather than personal, softening the final punch.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reversed walk reconfigures the board and Elara’s identity, cost felt in her aching scars and the dawn departure.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stone’s shattering embeds memory-work into Lirael’s body, reweighting “home” from place to act. Causal chain—feather → stone → cavern → bookstore—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens. One micro-turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the village unfreezes and Alaric steps away with “all the time in the world,” a Charged Poise that reweights his exile from punishment to vocation. Causal chain—pluck thread → memory → path revealed → pedestal → hush → unfreeze—holds under the Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the irreversible death of the prince, felt in the black thread beat.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the canyon’s refracted light reweights the elders’ lie with visible social cost (their chants falter, villagers rapt). Causal chain—ink → glow → light burst—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; one tightening suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the statue’s glowing cracks and Lira’s laugh crystallize a new stance toward imperfection. Causal linkage holds—each beat (“narrate,” press charm, remove mask) tightens options until the final image reweights the premise. Cost is legible in the acid searing her lungs and the gear clattering loose. Lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern taught early and paid off.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the wrong turn into the cave reframes the mirror’s fracture into a source of light, and the sketch beside the pool makes the “temporary eternity” tangible. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each sensory layer (salt, shell, reflected roof) deepens the stake until the final image reweights it. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a resonant reconfiguration: “the proof was in the silence.” The causal chain—humming breath → vial glow → distant villager tremor—holds a Situational lens cleanly and costs Elara her margin of youth and certainty.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=8.3)
    Plot drives on because/therefore causality under a Causal lens: hydraulics fail → phone rings → build bridge → signal coherence. Closure lands as Earned Stasis: the final spin of the foot crystallizes cost—the old routes now occupy the station’s airwaves. No orientation debt; scene anchors within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: storm → seek shelter → receive ledger → decide to “occlude.” Closure is a Charged Poise (“We occlude…”) that reconfigures next steps with felt social risk. One transition (orchard → hut) is clean; orientation anchors by line 5. No causality breaks, though ledger’s sudden appearance is lightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias vows to restore memories, reweighting his lifelong isolation. Causal lens holds—each beat (finding flower → meeting woman → opening trunk) links by “therefore.” Cost is implied but not viscerally on the page, keeping it below 9. Orientation is clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the doorway dissolves into memory-garden, then re-solidifies as self-knowledge with the chip as charged keepsake. Causal chain (map → ants → chip → doorway → return) holds; creek-rise clock tightens descent. Cost is felt—she exits “not as a lost soul”—but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure is a resonant Charged Poise—the choice to turn back carries felt ambiguity—but the pivot “You are not disenchanted…” is delivered by didactic oracle, not enacted by the queen, so the decisive change remains externalized rather than internally paid on-page, slightly eroding final cost.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=8.4)
    Single-scene causality holds: ledger discovery → reframing tactic → shell-guided alignment → stabilized nexus. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the engine’s new spectrum reweights prior explosions into usable knowledge. Orientation is anchored by “hidden forge beneath the city’s oldest clocktower” within 120 words. Persistent constraint: three prior sun-engine failures keep tension live.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the realization that nostalgia is a compass, not a curse, crystallizes in the final paragraph with felt conceptual cost. Causal chain—grave → scroll → ledge → blank scroll → insight—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. One transition (cabin to cliff) is clean. Orientation is secured by word 80.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s note crystallizes the screw’s meaning and reweights Mrs. Voss’s past with undeniable emotional cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of fog, drip, chime tightens to the final image. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks. The only gap: the note’s impact is off-stage, so the cost is conceptual rather than visibly paid by Lira.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing scars and parting mist crystallize a before/after stance with felt cost—Kael walks away “not as a scholar chasing answers.” Causality under an Accumulative/Textural lens holds; each sensory intensification (ink crystallizing, platform shudder) tightens the pattern toward the final image. Orientation is swift; no disorientation penalty applies.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the glowing drop, the voice, the chainsaws restarting crystallize a before/after of guilt transmuted into imperfect release. Causal chain holds—bottle as conductor, music as current, apology as circuit completion. One minor ellipsis: how the drop’s glow bridges to audible voice is elided, but the metaphoric current sustains legibility.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure is a Charged Poise—"dictionary pages blank"—creating a before-after in knowledge without causal chain fully legible; lens reads Accumulative/Textural and holds, yet the pivotal transition from cosmic maze to internal singularity is elided, breaking linear clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the seabed clock rewinding dissolves the premise that time is linear. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each backward count thickens atmosphere until the fjord itself ticks. Cost is felt in the image of “light dissolving,” though Lorn’s agency is observational rather than decisive.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the dissolution of barriers reweights the premise from defense to permeability, with the spore-rain image as felt cost. Causal chain holds—laser frequency → column softening → farm-wide shift. Orientation is anchored by line 3. One transition (barrier → heart chamber) is clean. No lens ambiguity; causal logic dominates.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Clara steps off the subway-car vision back into the library, stance crystallized. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—each scrawl and lantern flicker layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Minor ellipsis at Ms. Greer’s vanishing is functional.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each misrouted call layers texture until the disc’s final spin reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the music lingered…a reminder”—with conceptual cost (she stays alone underground). One transition (dawn above vs tunnel dark) is legible.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the covenant’s survival is reweighted from sacrifice to attention, with the jetty’s closing flowers as felt cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of small acts steeping into legend—but the decisive shift is articulated more than enacted on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the moon rock’s flare reweights loneliness from plague to “space between,” with Elias’s lighter chest as felt cost. Causal chain holds—rock summons conductor, conductor reframes loneliness—though the ghost’s negotiation is more asserted than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.6)
    The causal path—mother’s melody → ring‐translation → dop-song → map → stillpoint—locks cleanly into an Accumulative/Textural lens: density tightens, cost is felt when Elias “wades” to dig, and the final reconfiguration charges closure. Orientation, stakes, rhythm all cohere.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: anomaly reacts to Elias → Lira intervenes → he chooses to witness instead of edit. Closure is Earned Stasis: he forecloses the “fixer” path and walks toward apology; cost is the irreversible blight and his relinquished control. Orientation anchored by crater and pen within 120 words. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Charged Poise: the harbor’s silence has been reweighted from prison to canvas, with the cost that Kael must release the music to the town and remain its unheard translator. Causality is accumulative-textural: each signed phrase layers density until the final dawn image crystallizes the new equilibrium. Orientation is swift; moonlight and dock ropes anchor us by line 3. One transition (crowd disperses) is seamless.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tear Mara paints reweights the archive from tomb to living garden, with the grandmother’s face as felt cost. Causal linkage holds—each act of “vandalism” is a because/therefore step toward revelation. Orientation is anchored early (“shadowed halls… beneath layers of dust”). No lens ambiguity; the Accumulative/Textural pattern of art-trail intensifies until the final image reconfigures meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the joint drumming crystallizes Eli’s shift from passive survivor to active co-creator, with the lagoon’s glow as visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s whispered credo reweights the labyrinth’s rule-set while the glowing maps confirm the maze’s sentience. Causal chain—coin warmth → Libra symbol → key click → staircase → dawn return—holds under a Causal lens. One minor ellipsis: how the key’s brass fits a nonexistent lock is asserted rather than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=6.4)
    Closure is lyrical tableau (Charged Poise reconfiguration: darkness seen diffracted) rather than causally compelled shift; the “cost” (Lira’s nightly return) is forecast not enacted. Under Accumulative/Textural lens the image lands satisfyingly, but a single tightening is minimally present.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: seven games layer density until Lila’s stance crystallizes. Closure is a Charged Poise—“let’s keep planting”—with felt social cost. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: releasing the scrimshaw dissolves the island and reconfigures identity. The causal chain—violence → call → detach → freedom—holds under a Causal lens. One minor slack: the whale’s guardian status is asserted rather than earned.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene structure holds under Accumulative/Textural lens: each carving beat deepens the pattern until the final image crystallizes “lightness” as defiance. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift. Closure is a Charged Poise—the spoon and turbines reconfigure meaning with felt cost (“I will carve another” forecloses public mourning). One minor ellipsis (how she evades surveillance) accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lirael’s stance crystallizes when she steps onto the water, reweighting the premise that boundaries are immutable. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density and cadence shift rather than causal reversals—but the felt cost is slightly diffuse, keeping it just under 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: Elias’s new sight redefines both art and self. Causal chain—reed tongue → plant arrangement → mural eruption—holds without gaps.

One meaningful tightening: the mural’s fractals force Elias to confront Marla’s complicity, narrowing his options to embrace imperfection or retreat.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mountain’s song reweights the premise that connection must be engineered. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (lens, symbols, cave hum) deepens texture until the final reconfiguration. Causality is intact; no teleporting props. The cost is legible in Dr. Voss’s awe and Lira’s open-ended vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.5)
    Selected lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure presents a Resonant Reconfiguration: the stencil’s final inscription “Light the way” reweights atonement into ongoing renewal. Cue (dawn rising with beams still visible for miles) makes the cost undeniable; no teleporting beats or causal gaps detected. One smooth shard transition (workshop → beacon) is signaled with lantern activation, remaining within scope.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the loft becomes a quiet revolutionary cell, cost felt in the dawn light and Mara’s promise to “bring others.” Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the skylight’s rain reframes collapse as map. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the pagoda’s shifting carvings and thickening “atoms of nostalgia” tighten the texture until the golden light reconfigures Lirael’s stance—an earned Charged Poise that reweights the archive from tomb to seed. Causality is lyric rather than linear, but the closure beat is unmistakable and costly.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the spiral shadow resolves into luminous motes that reconfigure the library’s shelves—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration. Causal chain (footage → word → stone → shadow) holds under a Causal lens; only a faint ellipsis in how the future stone arrives keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the reconstructed tail becomes a map of survival that reweights Lira’s moral compass. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each scale added layers density until the dawn light crystallizes the new stance. Cost is legible in the “quiet, vivid truth” that replaces her earlier illusions. No causality breaks; the tail’s wholeness is inseparable from her internal shift.

Cost is legible in the burning scar and the tear-darkened floor.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: film density, rain rhythm, and letter ghosting tighten toward closure without causal reversals. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elise’s grief frame reframed by Mara’s empathy, cost legible in final lilac-scented sigh inside the booth.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sky dissolves into personal constellations spelling his fears, a charged poise that reweights the premise. Causal linkage holds—each sextant adjustment tightens toward the hidden chamber—though the archway’s mechanical shift feels slightly convenient. Cost is legible in the kneel and the dawn abandonment of the calendar.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=8.1)
    Single continuous scene; orientation (who/where/when) is clear by line 3. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s first dream reweights the archive’s purpose and the ticking clock signals cost. Causal chain—clock → choice → dream—holds under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=8.7)
    The story runs on an Accumulative/Textural drive: repeated exposure to forest sounds and gear imagery tightens into the revelation that the forest = brain. Closure—planting the gear-as-seed—reconfigures meaning via CR, with cost captured in “her pocket empty but her mind full.” One identifiable, legible lens and clean turning point satisfy the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the punch left on stone crystallizes the shift from seeking courage to stewarding it, with the felt cost of perpetual return. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of stamped tickets and shifting paths deepens meaning rather than causal chain. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One minor causality wobble: the punch glows once early then never again, but this does not rupture closure.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elric’s spoken words reweight the fortress’s social contract, with the piano’s pure note as felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure succeeds: the decisive moment sundering the illusion reconfigures authority in one visible stroke, incurring moral cost. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—mythic pattern accumulation (tomes, constellations, mosaic) presses toward the singular reweighting. Minor orientation drift—precise timing of Silent Convergence is asserted rather than grounded; however, the pattern’s payoff in the final paragraph justifies the ellipsis.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final image of glowing corals and reappearing paths reconfigures meaning with conceptual cost—reality itself is cyclically rewriting. Causal linkage holds (atlas → plankton coordinates → voyage), but the leap from “ghost data” to “gateways” is compressed rather than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the stones’ hum peaks, the rebellion’s voice roars, and the lull is reweighted into gathering storm. Causal chain (alignment → hum → signal → reignition) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only minor ellipsis between “Now!” and the roar.

    Causal lens holds: kite discovery → plant decoding → dig → hatch → choice to plant. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—future branches reweighted by her act, cost legible in the shuddering springs. One minor ellipsis: how she instantly knows the spiral symbol matches the lock.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: density of sensory markers (stone, salt, lavender) tightens toward the Charged Poise of the final tuck. Orientation anchored by line 3; no drift. Closure lands on-page—“her heart steady”—with felt cost: Elias’s absence is no longer a void to flee but a shape she can hold. One seamless scene, 740 words, single POV, one micro-turn (flinch-to-anchor).

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each new thread and card fragment layers density until the final image reweights the premise. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—portrait breathes, lighthouse sighs—felt cost is the surrender of old artistic identity. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: crash → ink ritual → hologram → door opens; each beat advances knowledge and narrows options. Closure is decisive—“she pressed her palm … and stepped inside” forecloses other paths with cost (she can no longer turn back). Slight ellipsis on Tower rules, but causality endures.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.7)
    Causal lens holds: because she receives contraband truths, therefore she awakens Kael, which irrevocably changes her status. Orientation is swift; closure is a clear Decisive Change with implied cost. One minor causality wobble: the “dormant networks” appear only at the end as explanatory afterthought rather than shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.9)
    The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and motif reprise escalate until “quiet” seeds its final resonant reconfiguration beneath the dome. Anchors are clear 75 words in, and closure (“the farm…had become a revolution”) crystallizes stakes in a Charged Poise charged with conceptual cost. One minor slack: time-tracking within the dome is fuzzy, but it does not injure the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure unit is Resonant Reconfiguration—garden regains harmony at cost of goddess, crystallized in the final clear note. Accum/Textural lens holds: zigzag patterns intensify, break, and coalesce without causal reversals; the spike reprise charges the final image. Orientation solid by 100 words; causal hiccup limited to 0.1.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=7.3)
    Causal chain holds—because Voss hid corruption → journalist's evidence → Clara assumes guilt → she hunts proof → closure—yet a single causality hiccup at the factory report (“Don’t let Clara see this”) feels author-willed rather than driven. Closure lands with visible cost: family rupture and public indictment.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the firmware’s code rewrites, the amber dims, dissonance gone—an earned Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost. Causal chain holds: amber pulse → letters → firmware memory → forgiveness beat. One minor slip: the “time folds” rule is asserted late and never visibly constrains tactics inside the memory corridor.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the mandala-tile synergy remaps the emergent hush from silence to collective language, forcing Mara to risk disruption by drawing on the wall. The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught and maintained—the repeating pattern→density shift reweights stakes without causal whiplash. A knock emerges in late-transition opacity (“bell tolled”) absent spatial cue, but it does not derail consequence. Cost is palpable—her older stance as detached recorder is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each sensory shard layers density until the final tessera reconfigures the plaza’s meaning. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise—where the mosaic’s ripple makes the cost of hope legible. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s golden hush and blank coin reweight the premise with conceptual cost—Elias’s encore costs his continued presence. Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of echo-gathering thickens until the maze dissolves. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One tightening—coin’s reversal—compresses stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.9)
    Causal lens threads because/therefore from static shock → somatic markers → geode → coherent neural map culminating in alignment flare felt in the wrist. Closure delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (the studio maps now glow with pay-attention urgency), leaving the pill recall behind and foreclosing any retreat. Anchors set early by 120-word mark.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the leaf’s dissolution into spores reweights Lira’s identity from observer to translator, and the cave’s exhalation marks a felt threshold. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (heat-map colors, algae glow, spore storm) intensifies pattern until the final image crystallizes meaning. One minor drift: “hibernation” is never causally tied to her urgency, so the global frame stays ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.8)
    The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the button cataloguing steadily intensifies the resonance of the jar until the canyon’s chorus crystallizes into a reweighted future. Closure lands as a Charged Poise—Mara turns the hourglass, now seeing the future as a field to plant—whose cost is the irrevocable release of the echo into the world. Orientation is clear within 120 words; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the act of transcribing the codes into soil, then walking away, crystallizes her stance and carries felt cost (the codes will vanish, trust required). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern of thawing layers, silver hush, and vanishing ink reweights the stake. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is a quiet Charged Poise—the silent exchange reconfigures the palimpsest promise—but the cost is only gestured at (“carry his own layer forward”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds, yet the tightening is more cadence than consequence. Orientation is clear by ~100 words, no debt.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image of Mara spinning clay beside the glowing glass reweights the entire timeline meditation. Causal chain—sunflower anomaly → lantern reaction → vision → recognition of anchored kindness—holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 5.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=8.3)
    The story adopts an Accumulative/Textural lens: the harbor, tool, moonlight, and widow absorb each gentle insistence until the dock rhythm coalesces into a resonant reconfiguration—Mara’s shutter ajar, cost registered in Elias’s lingering isolation. Causality is loose but coherent under that lens; no orientation or prop drift. Closure lands “outside...the harbor breathed,” a charged poise that re-weighs the prior beats without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.9)
    The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: images of extinction accrete until the spiral symbol reconfigures meaning. Closure lands cleanly with the decision to document, a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the library’s purpose; the cost is felt in the silence that follows the hum. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sinking orb reweights Lila’s prior ghostwriting into a stance of openness. Causal linkage is light—Elara’s guidance is more oracle than pressure—but the final image of dissolving secrets carries undeniable conceptual cost under an Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: every beat either tightens strategy ("synced her laptop… uploading code") or constricts outcomes when campus divides escalate funding crisis. Closure lands on a Charged Poise: the receiver now awaits future command with a felt loss—the tricksters are not done; the cost is the end of Lila’s innocence. A one-way transition (lab to quad) is handled cleanly and feeds straight into the closure image. No orientation drift or unexplained jump.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain (compass → organ → corridor → key) is legible and lands a decisive change—Elias exits the cathedral’s grip—yet the spatial mutiny rules are taught late, softening the because/therefore clarity at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the quarry’s silence lifts, the case reopens, and Clara’s empathy is re-weighted by the locket image. Causal chain—ribbon → sketch → handprint → locket—holds without gaps; each beat narrows options toward reopening the case. Orientation is anchored by word 60. One hairline slip: the dragged indentation appears late yet still feeds the handprint beat.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the warming nail and green sky crystallize stakes without resolving them, reweighting exile from shame to potential return. Causal chain holds—nail → stanza → dig → journal → roof—though the “door will open” beat is more incantation than mechanism. Cost is legible in the flickering lights and churning sea.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the flake clears, the world re-sets, and Elias faces a charged choice. Causal linkage is mostly implied (“because he played, therefore he arrives”), but the ellipsis is taught early and the final image crystallizes options with felt possibility-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias reweights the bills from curse to talisman and chooses non-violence, with a felt conceptual cost (“he’d broken the cycle”). Causality is causal-lite; the territorial-marker plan works because the text says it does, not because we watch Marcus’s choices change. Orientation is clear within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: the story layers grief-glyphs until the temple’s mirror reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Lirael steps into the hologram, accepting the lullaby etched on her skin—cost legible in the dawn light outside.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causality: vortex entrance → memory retrieval → seed payoff links cleanly; lyric compression lets reflection prime choice without dilution under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the covenant is rewoven inside her, sky now “two moons, one silver, one gold.” The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (ozone, elderberries, scar pulse) thickens until the final image reweights the premise. One causal gap: how pressing a clipping to skin rewrites reality is asserted more than dramatized, but the cost (scars gone, world altered) is visible on the final line.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: eating the fruit crystallizes her stance—recklessness now tempered by doubt—at visible cost (bitter juice, pulse of another heartbeat). Causal chain holds: Fool card → sewing → fruit → reweighted self. Orientation is swift; the half-light corridor anchors by line 3. No lens ambiguity; Accumulative/Textural pattern (density of roots, bones, fungi) tightens to the final glow.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal chain holds: botched appraisal → exile → cloth discovery → identification → purpose shift; each beat tightens options. Closure lands as Earned Stasis—he forecloses the “toss it” path and accepts quarry-level obscurity in exchange for story-keeping—cost is legible in the final line “after the applause, there was still music.”

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s roots shift, proving transition is reassembly. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of spirals, hum, light—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt; a single sentence of bodily consequence would have sealed 9-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure unit is the woman emerging with new identity, a Charged Poise that reconfigures possibilities (“I’m… lighter”) and the librarian tucking the feather—on page with felt cost—held under an Accumulative/Textural lens of tidal loops deepening meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.1)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural. Pearl-to-crystal fusion reconfigures lattice; final cadence shift (“the caves, once a tomb... cathedral”) reweights premise with conceptual cost. Anchorage clear by ≈80 words; closure is Charged Poise with felt cosmic cost radiating off-page. Pattern taught early (pulse sync) and paid off linearly.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new chalk “Begin” crystallizes reconfigured options after Mara’s accordion-breath re-mapping. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each graffiti fragment layers density until the final cadence shift. Cost is visible: she walks away unmedicated, bearing the river’s unfiltered hum. Orientation anchors by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal lens inferred and held; the cipher-driven narrowing from graph to book shelf lands with visible success, but the “backwards watch” never translates to tangible setback or forfeiture—so the closure is luminous rather than costly, making the final beat feel gift-like.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of “propagate” and recurring violet glow reweights stakes until Lira chooses renunciation. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration (stardust stasis); the cost—“only the ache remained”—is legible on the page. Drive holds without contradiction. Orientation is clear at 120-word mark.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the emerald’s steady glow and sealed cracks mark a before/after for both Elion’s echo and the grotto’s fate. Causal chain holds—each embellishment stroke directly counters the fissuring pool. Cost is legible in Lirael’s exhaustion and the grotto’s near-collapse. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern intensification (aurora kiss, lullaby absorption) reweights stakes without external reversals.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lirael’s choice to re-pin the hairpin reconfigures trust and forecloses lingering resentment. Causal chain—Elara’s theft, guilt, merchant’s return—holds. One transition (tree→ground) is legible. Orientation is anchored by 120 words. Cost is felt in the “quiet understanding” that still trembles in her knees.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands cleanly: Mira’s final chime-removal crystallizes a stance with felt cost, and the causal lens holds; the lighthouse sequence is one continuous scene, anchored early, with no orientation drift.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s spiral-helix insight reweights the premise without exposition, the cost felt in Elara’s relinquishing of control. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern density and withheld revelation tighten stakes until the final image reframes them.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.9)
    Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s new stance crystallizes in the final image (descending while pulse guides). Orientation is clear by 80 words; causality holds via pattern recognition → reconfiguration of stillness. Cost is implied in leaving ancestral perch.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the spire seals, Kael exits lighter, and the cost—loss of the impossible garden—is legible in the final sunlight. Causal chain holds (keystone → sketch → garden → exit) under an Accumulative/Textural lens; one transition (ice → garden) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the key’s placement and the humming color of sound reweight Elias’s stance under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Causality is held through the pattern of light and memory; the final image crystallizes options with felt cost. No orientation debt; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Kael’s raised hands and universe-answering wavelength crystallize the new stance with undeniable cost (loss of prior doubt). Causal chain from coin-circle to signal-thread is legible under an Accumulative/Textural lens; one minor ellipsis mid-scene is tolerated.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.1)
    The causal chain (find atlas → amplify echoes → name monsters → absorb them) is clean and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: the atlas page gains weight, the reaper gains purpose. Orientation is swift; dusk, observatory, and scythe are anchored within 50 words. Closure cost is felt in the ache of “knowing” and the extinguished prism light.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.9)
    The piece sustains a tidy causal chain from bell-drip sync through tidal harmony to rift stitching; the closure lands as Charged Poise—harm re-instated but silently contingent—earning full structural marks.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s placement of her own photo beside the ghosts crystallizes her new custodial stance. Causal chain (label → photos → daughter → shared guardianship) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the surrender of solitary control.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern density of starlings → crystal facets → equation tightens stakes to a Charged Poise. Closure lands on the page—“the equation was perfect”—with felt cost (burned hand, foregone secrecy). No orientation drift; spatial anchors clear by line 4.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the arbor’s steady glow reweights “trust” from burden to covenant. Causal chain—static → wrong pattern → buckle sequence → spiral realignment—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by “nocturnal arbor above the clouds” within 120 words. Cost is visible in sweat, fatigue, and the silent radio.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds: each energy exchange narrows options until the merge becomes inevitable. Closure is a decisive change—clone erased, emotions restored—paid for by the loss of a potential future self. Anchors are clear within 120 words; no orientation debt. One causal tightening suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the key reweights the entire mystery under an Accumulative/Textural lens. The spiral motif threads from envelope to key, but the plant’s overnight vanish leans on convenient ellipsis rather than earned causality.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each blast of the blower thickens the echo density until the shimmer bursts into voices. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—laughter restored, body spent—cost visible in “tears streaming.” One minor causality wobble: the tunnel’s acoustics are asserted, not taught early.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: tossing the pendant reweights “boundaries of light” from prison to door. Causal chain—lure, wait, toss, path opens—holds under Causal lens; no teleporting props. Orientation is clear by 3rd paragraph; deliberate mist disorientation pays off at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the rebuilt crozier hovers radiant, re-weighting the nexus’s stalled order; both the cost (blood drawn from Kael’s palm) and the decisive alteration in the world’s rule-set occur visibly on the page. Drive lens is Causal—each iteration of the metallic weave follows a because/therefore logic under successive approximation. The Orientation Test is met in the opening two lines; no lens ambiguity penalty applies. A minor causality hiccup: Kael’s instant recall of “vivify” as a dream relic is one convenient step, keeping it just shy of 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the tower’s rebirth reweights the premise. Causal chain holds—each dismantling beat tightens access to the hush—though the leap from fragment to city-wide resurrection could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: ferry dissolves, timelines merge, Kael stands alone with new constellation overhead—felt cost is the permanent loss of purpose. Causal chain holds: empty hourglass → radio pattern → prism beam → merged lives. Orientation anchors by line 3; no drift. Minor ellipsis in how “interconnected patterns” translate to tones is tolerated under lyric lens.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=8.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each weave thickens perceptual density until the final Charged Poise (“the world seemed to shift, just slightly”) reweights the premise with felt cost—her prior certainty is foreclosed.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lirael’s declaration that “we must learn to navigate not just by what we see, but by what we feel” reweights the premise and forecloses her own drift. The lens is Accumulative/Textural; pressure tightens through layered imagery rather than causal turns, and the cost is felt in her somber marvel.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration: the synchronized pulses crystallize the before/after of love acknowledged. Causal chain is tight—photo → pulse → twin hearing aid → whisper—yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral, nudging it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the holographic blip reweights the premise—brother’s “presence” archived in cable field—at visible cost (facility flooding, gold dimming). Causal lens holds: each beat (descent, codex retrieval, catalyst activation) tightens options until only exit-with-proof remains. No orientation debt; who/where/when anchored by 80 words.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure is an Earned-Stasis variant: Elias lets the paradox stand, tracing the teacup spiral into dried permanence, a Cost framed as acceptance rather than erasure. Structure is Accumulative/Textural—ink patterns, shard, static beats layer and reweight meaning. Orientation, causality, and lens hold without contradiction; the AI exchange and heartbeat counting provide persistent constraint. Cost is legible—but the “wisdom fetched” feels more elegiac than enacted, so ceiling remains just under elite.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.4)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern-building of bird rhythms → diamond resonance → rune ignition → echo backlash. Closure is Earned Stasis: hurling the diamond forecloses translation, cost seared palm and permanent silence. Orientation anchored by line 3. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.8)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: static confessions layer density until the spiral symbol reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Elara stands human again but “not as a researcher”—with the open-ended spiral as visible cost. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the orchard’s shift from mechanized order to wild responsiveness is legible and irreversible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each beat layers sensory density until the geyser of light reweights the world. Cost is visible in the snapped string and bleeding fingers.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure takes the form of Charged Poise when the arcade lights up and the hush “feels more like a promise.” Under the Accumulative/Textural lens the storm’s release reweights the stakes from broken to breathing; the bottle’s journey supplies the “because.” A visible cost—the soldiers lowering guns and the arcade resurrecting half-machines—is present, yet the causal line slips at “the drone had done its job,” summarizing rather than dramatizing the border moment.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the courtyard’s transformed circle and Elio’s final smile crystallize a new stance toward silence. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—patterned imagery (mist, bells, fragment) tightens until the song reweights the whole. One minor drift: the “wrong turn” mechanic appears late and functions more as reveal than causal pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the library’s new pulse reweights the premise with felt cost (“the energy she’d unleashed”). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—density of whispering books and shifting mirrors tightens stakes—but the transition into the circular room leans on coincidence rather than causal trigger.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the dream dissolves into “a thousand particles of light,” reweighting the premise that capture was never the goal. Causal linkage is lyric-accumulative; each dawn session layers pattern until the final pulse of pigment refuses to blend, forcing stance crystallization with visible cost—she abandons the chase.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.2)
    The causal lens holds cleanly: star’s pulse → Elias acts → locket opens → hair dissolves → altered world. Each beat is followed by a “therefore” that narrows options. Closure is earned in the final paragraph via Resonant Reconfiguration where Elias assumes the burden of secrets in a re-sculpted reality. Orientation within first 120 words holds. One minor flaw: the mechanics of how the hair actually unlocks remain abstract; causality momentarily wavers.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the greenhouse becomes a bridge, not a tomb, and the locket’s silver light reweights the premise. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens—pattern recognition tightens until memory is restored—though the “price” Clara hints at remains abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the woman’s “I’ll walk backwards” crystallizes a new path with felt risk, and the shadow’s thinning reconfigures stakes. Causal chain holds—tea reading → literal backward walk → possible reversal—though the exile rule is asserted more than tested on-page.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the seed’s absence and the blossom’s appearance crystallize the new equilibrium. Causal chain holds: fracture → dream → ritual → geyser → orchard revival. Cost is legible in the hollow pocket and the iridescent blossom she must now steward.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the net’s dissolution into key is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights silence from prison to open conversation. Causality is Accumulative/Textural—each loosened knot thickens the hush until pattern-break releases it. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. Cost is conceptual (loss of protective silence) rather than visceral, but still legible.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.4)
    The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density (1923 vs drone footage, shifting carvings) tightens until the chapel’s warm silence reweights the premise. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias reframes the map from border to invitation—felt in the final breath visible in still air. Causality is intact: each comparison of film frames materially widens the crack. Minor slack: the tear’s geography is never fully anchored, but the pattern coherence overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the tape’s hum reframes “letting go” as transmission, not erasure. Causal chain (tape → tuning fork → snow-globe motor) holds, but the 12-second loop’s agency feels external rather than driven by Elara.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each graffito layers memory-density until the storm’s cadence shift reweights the courtyard as archive. Closure is a Charged Poise—the bluebell pressed into the plate—whose cost is the acceptance that messages will fade.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s “I ascend” crystallizes her new stance and forecloses servant passivity. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each object (diary, goggles) layers meaning until the final image reweights the premise with felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single continuous scene anchored by ~120 words; the inferred Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern of cloud-emotion cataloguing that tightens into dawn epiphany. Closure is a Charged Poise: the gondola drifts, options reweighted, cost legible in Lila’s relinquishing of proof for belief. No causality breaks or orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the portrait becomes the new “sky inside walls,” reweighting the guild’s premise. Causal linkage holds—coin → panel → safe → journal → paint—yet the demolition clock is more scenic than causal driver. One transition (inside tree → outside chaos) is clean; orientation is anchored by damp bark and wrecking-ball shadows within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.4)
    Causal linkage holds: hopscotch → coordinates → portal → leap. Closure lands as Decisive Change with conceptual cost (knowledge of “truth”), but the price is more stated than shown. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the gears are found, the clock ticks, and Kael’s stance shifts from seeker to bearer-of-tools. Causal chain holds—prophecy → mirrors → alcove—though the “crescent-moon lock” is a touch too neat.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=7.2)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the arch holds, the nebula flares, the bell tolls—collective effort crystallized. Causality is thematic rather than procedural; the chalked messages serve as lyrical catalysts rather than plot mechanics. One tightening beat—the settlers gathering—suffices under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the lullaby reweights the premise from cataclysm to gentle sigh, with the pane’s shattering and puppet’s dissolution as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern density increases until the fractal pane unravels. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. The final image crystallizes options without tidy resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.7)
    Dominant lens clear: causal. Each marker placement is a deliberate act that narrows labyrinth paths. Closure beat—slam nut-lock door—Decisive Change with legible price: reset labyrinth, Kael left in frost. Traveler vanishes, birds diverted, curse recharged. No teleporting props; nut blueprint learned via discovery years prior and triggers final mechanic. One minor orientation lag—“kneeling by fountain”—clears within two lines. Cost locked in “roots pulse,” “frost bloom.”

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands cleanly with the chrysalis release and hand-squeeze—an Earned Stasis that forecloses continued estrangement. Causal chain is thin: the foam insight is stated, not dramatized as a decision trigger, and the pivotal text message sits off-stage. Mosaic structure (ravine → studio → ravine) is legible, but the transitions feel like fade-outs rather than pressure-bearing hinges.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the golden residue re-weights the premise, proving absence can recur and be accepted; cost is the forfeiture of her prized jar and the uncertainty now carried for the stranger’s tale. Causal chain holds—sale → warning → echoing note → crystallized stance—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation is clear by line 6; no teleporting props or amnesia.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Nessar’s stance toward remorse shifts from analytical distancing to embodied carrying, the cost legible in his unsteady legs and tingling tongue. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory accretion (rain, salt, coral chill) reweights the emotional load until the final simmering broth releases it. Orientation is swift; causality is clean. The only hairline slip: the “unspoken dream” frame arrives late and could confuse timeline, but the final image overrides it.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the tower’s midnight chorus reweights the village–scholar rift with audible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—patterned language layers until the final chord—but the grain elevator’s “single clear note” arrives as coincidence, softening the causal bite.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the mirror’s transformed surface and entangled memories foreclose Kael’s prior isolation with visible conceptual cost. Causal linkage holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; only a minor Orientation lag at the canyon’s first mention.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.6)
    Closure lands cleanly on the key: a resonant reconfiguration that reweights the grotto’s eye motif and forecloses a path after felt inversion cost. Causal linkage holds under the situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the grove itself begins to “strum,” proving rhythm survives silence. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each strum layers density until the porcelain’s shattering becomes the pattern break that releases the buried song. Orientation is swift; anchors of place and POV are clear by line 3. Cost is legible in the insulator’s shards and Elara’s spent body.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the covenant is re-embodied in the sapling, cost paid in exile and solitude. Causal chain holds—stone dent → eclipse map → key → seed—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the diary’s click reweights silence from barrier to bridge. Causal chain—memory of radio → tuning fork → resonance → click—holds without gaps. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words. Cost is legible in the final image: Lirael walks away changed, silence now freighted with empathy.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each journal entry and doodle thickens pattern until the hush itself reweights the stake. Closure is a Charged Poise—the blooming flower reconfigures village energy with visible communal awe—though the causal “because” between doodle-hush and bloom could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the arrow tip fuses, gravity permanently re-anchors, and Lira’s stance crystallizes into stewardship. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of echoes, vines, light—but the cost is more thematic than bodily, keeping it just shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: each gust tightens options until the climactic discovery. Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—port as hungry machine—with felt cost in Anya’s redesign mandate. Minor drift: patch’s sudden resonance feels like a late rule tweak.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the cavern’s “low, resonant hum” reweights silence into living hymn, cost felt in Lira’s flushed cheeks and Veyra’s dropped chisel. Causal chain is tight—song → color → ice shift → sculptor’s conversion—without teleportation. Orientation is immediate; frost, bell, and aurora anchor by line 4. One transition (cavern ↔ sculptor) is legible and serves escalation. Lens holds as Accumulative/Textural: each hue layer intensifies texture until silence liquefies.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s surrender rune crystallizes a new stance with felt cost (broken flute, irrevocable lesson). Causal chain holds—uncasing flute → fissure → chamber → unmaking attempt → silence → surrender—without teleporting props. Orientation is anchored by driftwood markers and canyon geography within the first 120 words. Lens is Causal; no ambiguity at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal lens holds: Elias’s deliberate ambiguity → fragment confusion → transposed empathy → tear-stained realization. Closure is a Decisive Change: he abandons the analytical stance, foreclosing further experimentation. Orientation is anchored within 120 words; no teleporting props. The cost (loss of detachment) is legible in the fogged goggles and fragment settling “cool and obedient.”

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain—pendant vibration → meeting hooded woman → planting seed → sapling emergence—holds cleanly, and the closure (Kail’s realization that absence is germination) lands as a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. Orientation is swift; only one transition (woman’s dissolve) keeps the single-scene default.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Conceptual Repricing: the arbor’s mirror-truth reframes the entire quest. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer thickens until the prism’s distortion is exposed. Causality is intact: because Mara projects, therefore the quartz amplifies, therefore she must relinquish her method. The cracked car window crystallizes the cost on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara’s sacrifice reconfigures the orchard’s silence into song and the distant village’s fate. Causal chain—bead → puzzle → twin bead → release—holds without gaps; cost is legible in the dimming beads and floating loss. Orientation is anchored early; one transition (puzzle completion) is clean. No lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: silk arrives → Jorin studies → enters mine → confronts Lira → absorbs orb → orchards bloom. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost (blood, spectral ordeal). One clean transition from surface to mine; orientation anchored by lantern flicker and crystalline walls. No teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.2)
    Causal lens holds: shard’s pull → portal jump → confrontation → renunciation, each beat tightening options. Closure is a decisive change (hurling the shard) with felt cost: “his hands trembled.” Orientation is anchored early; the single transition is legible. One causal gap: how the shard’s override actually interfaces with the visor tech.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the lighthouse beam is gone, yet Elias’s nightly stacking now carries the beacon’s moral weight. Causal chain—glass → note → stack → reply—tightens options until endurance becomes the only viable stance. Lens is Accumulative/Textural: pattern density and cadence shift reweight the stake. Cost is legible in the final image of Elias pocketing the singing glass, now a portable vigil.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.7)
    The causal arc lands cleanly: lantern adjustment → shadow prophecy → decision to steer dawn, culminating in a Charged Poise at balcony’s edge. Orientation is quick; the lighthouse and keeper anchor by line two, sustaining coherence. The final image of raised light and “a choice” reconfigures premise, but the internal cost—though felt—is not dramatized beyond breath and laughter, so closure stays legible yet stops short of higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure hinges on the wing-triggered sun flare charging the final image (Resonant Reconfiguration under an Accumulative/Textural lens); no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the shimmering wall becomes permeable, reweighting the labyrinth’s layers and Elias’s role. Causality holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens—each disassembled cog thickens pattern until moonlit map opens—but the cost (what Elias forfeits by crossing) is only implied, not felt on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure arrives via Earned Stasis: Lira keeps humming even as the night retreats, accepting perpetual guardianship. The chosen Accumulative/Textural lens tightens by density—note by added note—until the final “bound release” reimages the orchard as a living dawn-song. On-page cost is felt (voice raw, “hoarse”) not summarized.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain (invitation → map → key → letters) is clean and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration: Eleanor’s choice to remain re-weights her stance on hiding. Orientation is swift; the library’s geography is legible. Closure cost is present but soft—grief softens rather than a path being foreclosed with visible price.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the bread vanishes, replaced by a seed that reweights the premise—absolution is process, not pardon. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of noticing → planting → charged final image. Orientation is swift; causality is lightly elliptical but coherent. The only drag is the woman’s tidy articulation of the theme, which momentarily flattens the mystery.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the dawn light steadies the illusions, reweighting the library’s fate. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sampled frequency layers density until the cadence shift at dawn. Cost is legible in Elara’s slammed fist and the static that still threatens future vows.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: every beat links because/therefore—bribe fails therefore follow jester, eavesdrop therefore reach tower, smash therefore chaos. Closure is Earned Stasis: she keeps the broken fob, silence now costs her father’s recorded betrayal. Time anchors early; no orientation drift. One tightening at 11:47 → midnight suffices.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael’s worldview tilts—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the aurora-framed hush crystallizes cost. Causality holds, though the decisive internal pivot could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the shadow-door opens to darkness, reweighting the premise—silence is rectified, not filled. Causal linkage holds: lock → painting → shadow → click. One transition (surface descent) is clean. Cost is legible in the breath that replaces laughter.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s stance crystallizes—“It’s a seed”—with conceptual cost (accepting echo over verbatim). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of truth-testing via quill and orb density reweights the stake. Orientation is anchored by ~120 words. No causality breaks; keeper’s reveal is motivated ellipsis that changes knowledge.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the sculpture’s final chord crystallizes the bluff’s new role as living instrument, with the iceberg’s disappearance as visible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each droplet, swing, and shimmer layers density until the last note reweights meaning. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis: how the visitors ascend is elided, but it does not disturb the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.4)
    Drive lens: accumulative-textural. Closure charged with resonant reconfiguration: orb absorption reweights Clara’s self-concept and farm’s glass prison. Early orientation clear within 110 words. Causality holds: static → box leak → controlled burn → miniaturize → integration; no reset or luck, final image makes conceptual cost legible.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain holds: locket clue → neighborhood stories → combination lock → mailbox opened. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Clara’s stance toward objects and stories is permanently reweighted by the soldier’s unfinished farewell. The Orientation Test is met by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=9.0)
    Dominant lens: Accumulative/Textural—because/therefore links via deciphered dance steps; escalating pattern culminates in Charged Poise climax: “As he trudged ashore...the spider had spun its web.” Cost is felt in the smile and vial weight, end reconfigures premise.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance shifts from fear to stewardship, charged by the rose-key. Causal chain is clear (coffee pattern → panel → rose), yet the cost is more conceptual than visceral on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the crane-wing dissolves, silence re-orders the haven, and the prophecy is hushed with visible cost (wing turns to dust). Accumulative/Textural lens holds—pattern of silence-densification culminates in final cadence shift. One micro-turn suffices; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the library answers, stakes reconfigured, cost audible in dust and vibration. Causal lens holds: sugar borrowing → weekly lies → tonight’s lie to the building. One transition (garden to dome) is clean. No orientation drift; rooftop, meteor shower, and seal are anchored early. Cost is on-page: “the library shuddered… a voice answered.”

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shell added thickens the pattern until the cadence shift (roses to ash) crystallizes the Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—constellations of light replacing quarantined ghosts—though the resonance mechanics could be causally sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the scroll placed, the thorn tucked away, the echo of purpose left behind. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each drip of the stalactites, each hue of aurora layers density until the final image crystallizes choice and cost. Orientation is swift; causality is implied through ritual sequence rather than external events. One soft spot: the treaty’s exact stakes are abstract, blunting the “before/after” clarity by a hair.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Kael’s purpose crystallizes when the canyon “sings back.” Causality holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; however, the cost is implied rather than dramatized, keeping it shy of 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the shrine’s ice “hummed” approval, reweighting the premise that truth must be woven, not spoken. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—dream shards accrue meaning until the final image reconfigures stakes. One transition (shrine → descent) is legible. Orientation is clear by line 3. Cost is felt but diffuse; a crisper price would push higher.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.9)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds cleanly: pattern density, subtle tempo shifts, and the firefly code tighten perception to earned stasis. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration—Kael’s new attuned silence—whose cost is legible as lifelong vigilance rather than discrete event; orientation beats land well before 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (find journal → reassemble letters → test diamond → seal stillpoint) tightens options under rising stakes. Closure lands as Decisive Change with felt cost—the orchard’s fertility traded for world safety. One minor ellipsis (how Mara intuits the second diamond’s purpose) keeps it from 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: storm, voices, and prismatic light build density toward Charged Poise—“You are the prism. You are the storm.” Closure lands with conceptual cost (time’s arrow questioned) though causal linkage is more atmospheric than sequential.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elias’s stance crystallizes into “not to be remembered, but to remember,” with the music box’s hum as audible cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each jar layers density until the final cadence shift. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. The loft’s lonesome splendor re-enters the last line, tightening the loop.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.5)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost vanishes after Elias proves the key is a bridge, not a lock; the lighthouse beam “guiding ships—and perhaps souls—home” crystallizes that stance with felt cost (body spent). Accumulative/Textural lens held: every wave of sound thickens until pattern breaks into acceptance. Orientation clean; anchors drift-ice marina / twilight are legible within one beat. No loophole resolutions.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.7)
    (No comment)

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    The closure—Mara’s decision to expose Cole using empirical evidence—lands as an earned pivot, visible cost framed by the shuddering train overhead and gut-level refusal; lens is hybrid (situational crystallization plus causal knowledge gain). Orientation anchors by 100 words without debt.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.8)
    The causal chain is clear: suspicion → encounter with artifact → recognition of program’s worth → decision to champion it. Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Marcus carries the heart back to the prison, a charged poise that reweights the warden’s “apology” into actionable reform. Cost is implied—his prior certainty is surrendered—but could be sharper on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.6)
    Causal chain holds: kaleidoscope image → transliteration tweak → dive → arrow as clapper → bell hums. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost: the glider wrecks, the sea roars, the workshop shudders. Orientation is clean by line 8; no teleporting props. One minor slack: the tower’s sudden appearance reads like coincidence rather than prior foreshadow, but it complicates rather than resolves, so lens integrity survives.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: each discovery (numbers → deleted files → coordinates) tightens options until the upload act forecloses retreat. Closure is a decisive change—Lira escapes into the unknown with the coordinates—yet the felt cost is slightly abstract; the drones’ red lights suggest danger more than exact consequence. Orientation is swift; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the fragment’s glow spreads, aurora brightens, ice stills—cost is felt in the long shadow across snow. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural; pattern of mirrored glimpses tightens stakes without causal reversals. Orientation is clear by line 3; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lila’s redefinition of the “fold in patience” lands with felt cost as she renounces the clinic and folds her vigil by the ice; causal string is intact, one transition (ice-rescue) is clean, and timeline tracks consistently.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the pavilion becomes “a sanctuary—not for answers, but for questions,” reweighting the stake from finding meaning to embracing uncertainty. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer (amber light, smoke, rain) thickens until the final cadence shift. Cost is present but soft: two mismatched souls “begin to rediscover,” yet nothing is renounced or paid. Orientation is clear by line 3; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Single-scene arc holds; orientation is swift and causal linkage (“prophet arrives → consecration ritual”) is legible. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—wisdom echo secured, line endures—yet the prophet’s unexplained catalyst weakens the final beat’s felt cost.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of arcs (photos, vines, sketches) deepens until the dove-feather/“enough” reconfigures meaning. Closure is a resonant reconfiguration with conceptual cost; no orientation debt. One transition (walk home) is brief and contiguous.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the crystal’s refracted light tightens the pattern motif until Elias reweights his stance. Closure lands as Charged Poise—he leaves the library “no longer silent”—with the crystal’s new glint as felt cost. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.7)
    Anchored by ~80w; clear one-scene arc driven by causal search ("because he needs the sound, therefore he rearranges driftwood") compressing toward the Earned Stasis of renouncing future-sight. Fog, chalk, and rebar sculpture each constrain later moves. Closure image—"thicker line"—bears unmistakable conceptual cost ("I don't need the future anymore").

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the clock’s silence and the portal’s gold edge reweight the premise with undeniable cost. Causal chain holds (hand→signal→circuit→portal→leap) under a Causal lens; only a micro-gap in how the portal’s rules are learned keeps it from 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    Accumulative/Textural lens: each sensory layer (vinyl crackle, hymn swell, sky bleed) tightens the emotional density toward the Earned Stasis of Elias’s last breath and the shard’s bequest. Orientation is immediate; no causality breaks. Closure image—“radiant haven seemed to hum”—reconfigures meaning with felt cost: Mira’s perpetual return to loss.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=7.4)
    Drive lens is Causal: each beat (key discovery, constellation alignment, insertion) follows because/therefore logic. Closure lands on-page with a decisive change—gateway revealed—yet the cost (loss of mystery? risk of backward time?) is implied rather than felt on the page, capping the score.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The causal chain—finding tooth → planning alignment → Elias’s arrival → dual placement → fountain re-flow—tightens options and reconfigures the garden’s meaning. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the garden’s mirror truth reframes their past and future. One micro-turn suffices at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.6)
    Tight causal spine: Elara captures memory, polishes grief, weighs cost, and relinquishes light in exact sequence. The final star-wink lands as resonant reconfiguration, earned and legible under situational lens.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    Single continuous scene; orientation is swift and spatial anchors hold. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the pendant’s re-setting and the sapling planting crystallize a new stance with felt cost—the brother’s memory is no longer a private shrine. Causal linkage is clean; no teleporting props or retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.7)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: mist density, cameo travelers, and shell glow tighten the pattern until the final cadence shift (“she began again”). Closure is a Charged Poise—manuscript reopened, door ajar—whose cost is the forfeiture of tidy resolution. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.1)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lira’s open offer ushers in shared guardianship with a felt cost—the spent tendril. Drive is Accumulative/Textural; each golden thread deepens the stakes until the forest “pulses” back to life, tightening the same tapestry. Orientation and causality are clean; only a single heartbeat of ambiguity—will the alliance endure?—tilts the lens slightly toward situational poise rather than decisive pivot.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure hinges on the imagined heartbeat-to-map translation crystallizing as Charged Poise—landed on the page with felt conceptual cost. Causal escalation from patience→starlight→seal→earned insight is disciplined across 750 words.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the timer’s restoration crystallizes a charged poise—wonder bottled yet alive—while Elias’s descent signals relinquishment. Causal chain holds: reverse-engineering → gear insertion → harmonic surge → storage. Orientation is anchored early (“marble cavern hummed…”) and sustained. One minor ellipsis—how the intact gear survived—is forgiven because the final image reweights the premise without contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Kael leaves the locket untouched, a visible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens. The grotto’s lighter hush and the clinking satchel reweight the premise. Orientation is swift; no causality breaks. One hairline slip: the “whalebone reverie” line feels slightly ornamental rather than causal.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each shaving and steam curl layers density until the lion’s quiet completion reweights the void. Closure is a Charged Poise—the lion on the sill reframes absence into vessel—cost is the irreversible absence itself, visible in the cold kettle and burned-down candle. No orientation drift; skylight and loft anchored early. One smooth shard with no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of fragment-collecting intensifies until the camera wheel’s release reweights the stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Veyra’s sleep without dreams and the violet rose—whose cost is felt in her permanent absence. Orientation is anchored early; no causality breaks. A hairline slip: the fishermen’s epilogue is slightly expository, nudging the score below 9.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the luminous equation projects hope while the terminal dims, reconfiguring meaning without tidy resolution. Causal chain is clear—find sextant → reroute systems → equation appears—yet the cost is conceptual rather than visceral. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity. One minor ellipsis: how rerouting abandoned conduits yields immediate light is elided.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.2)
    The closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the keep becomes a compass, not a prison. Causality is soft—Accumulative/Textural lens—but the final image reweights earlier motifs (gears, petrichor, bear) with conceptual cost. Orientation is clear by ~90 words; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening occurs when the forecourt’s song fuses with the bear’s growl, shifting Lira’s stance. The price—she forfeits the dream of leaving yet gains a new listening—is legible on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the sundial’s shadow reweights the entire quest from place to epistemic stance. Causal chain holds—sundial → shadow → warehouse → blueprint—with one clean transition off the barge. Cost is conceptual (loss of naïve legend-hunting) and is legible in the final image of dawn over the canal.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure arrives as Charged Poise: the last sentence “all felt sacred” reweights the entire scene and reconfigures Elias’s prior quest as stewardship itself. Causal chain holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; each knot viewed through the glass tightens meaning until the woman’s whisper crystallizes renunciation-with-cost.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.4)
    Lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of silence-grief threads accruing). Closure as Charged Poise in final image (“walked into the fading light, parchment cradled”) is legible and resonant, yet the cost remains aesthetic-lonesome with no new consequence actually shown—weight is felt, but lightly.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands cleanly: the orb’s flare reconfigures the palace from metal to moss, a decisive change with visible cost (the egg itself is gone). Causal chain is tight: egg found → hypothesized → assembled → hatched → world altered. Orientation is immediate; the palace’s stalactite anchors are named by line 3. One minor ellipsis—how the orb transmutes matter—is allowed under lyric license.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.2)
    The piece tracks under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the lagoon, coin, and sand accrue symbolic weight until the final image reconfigures meaning. Orientation is clean within 120 words; the single-scene default is met. Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lira’s release of the grain crystallizes her stance and forecloses the path of clinging to inherited guilt. The cost is felt in the relinquishing of the coin’s anchor, satisfying the 9+ quick test.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: breadcrumb pattern teaches early and culminates in a resonant reconfiguration—the fountains’ roar and transparent box. Closure lands on-page with undeniable conceptual cost: memories freed, Lira’s certainty unmoored. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no causality breaks. One minor ellipsis (how she “sees” the marble vision) is accepted under lyric license.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the gear left spinning reweights the Enclave’s ban from rejection of fire to rejection of violence. Causal chain holds—each beat (pinging urgency → grove encounter → gear placement) tightens the choice under the Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost is legible in the ghost’s dissolution and Lumin’s solitary walk back.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.5)
    Drive lens chosen as Accumulative/Textural; causality holds through “Because poems linger, therefore Marlow rewrites ritual.” Closure unit (poem recited, voice gone, thundering calm) lands with visible, felt cost: the inherited sorrow becomes the stone he must now shape. Orientation anchors by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Accumulative/Textural lens is taught early and held: each obsidian shard, each swing-stall, layers pressure until the rake-handle inscription crystallizes the pattern. Closure is a Charged Poise: the pendulum resumes, the ridge reseals, and the cost is the searing reverie Lirael endures—visible on the page. One transition (ridge → tower) is clean and motivated.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara’s understanding reweights the silo’s purpose—under an Accumulative/Textural lens; the tapestry’s threads tighten meaning without causal reversals. Orientation is clear by 120 words; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=7.9)
    Causal lens holds: each observation (lake temperature, star positions) tightens the forecast until the equinox crack rewrites the village’s future. Closure is a Decisive Change—the thaw arrives on schedule, reconfiguring the villagers’ stance. Cost is felt in Lira’s splintered quill and burnt past. Orientation is anchored early; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the static fades, the alcove darkens, and Lira steps out carrying the fragments—an earned reconfiguration of her stance. Causality is Accumulative/Textural; the lyric density tightens rather than pivots. Orientation is swift; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure comes as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira leaves the portrait unfinished, accepting temporal fragility; the lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of ash-haze reweights the stake). One causality gap—why unfinished matters now instead of later—keeps it from 7+.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal linkage: gnawing need to exhume relics triggers scavenging, oppositions with Mara that tighten, and culminates in crystallized final image where cog + needle reconfigure meaning. Closure (Charged Poise) lands with conceptual cost: he trades open future for rebellion.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    Closure is Earned Stasis rather than decisive physical change; the final image of the rosette “spinning” is quietly resonant but cost feels collective rather than personally paid by Clara. Mild causality drift when world-events (“borders hardening”) are asserted more than demonstrated.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands cleanly: the plant’s reconfiguration from trauma to future-garden vision is a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost (her trembling, exhaustion). Causal chain is tight—each prune triggers memory and growth—though the celestial alignment functions more as atmospheric cue than causal driver.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city’s lights return, but Clara’s stance crystallizes—she accepts permanent public exposure as toll-keeper-evangelist. Causal chain holds: blackout → drone failure → disbelief detected → reveal → candor as solution. One transition (night to next dusk) is clean. Orientation is clear by line 5. Minor slack: Voss’s late arrival delivers a rule-change about “wonder as fuel” that the story retrofits rather than seeds.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each displaced object layers hush until the bay’s sanctification reweights the premise. Closure lands as Charged Poise—“the houses now felt alive”—with conceptual cost (Lira’s worldview irreversibly altered), though the price could be more viscerally felt.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.6)
    Drive lens = Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds via accumulating imagery and revelation until closure reweights meaning. The orientation of place/time is secured within ~120 words. Closure achieves Charged Poise: Mara’s ingestion crystallizes stakes and reconfigures the premise (“not a tomb, but a laboratory”) with undeniable cost. One seam artifact—teleported thread from ship to pool without spatial linkage—nicks coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: each loop layers pattern until the rupture breaks cadence and births the perpetual orbit. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Kael’s stance shifts from possession to witness—charged by the dice’s refusal to be grasped. Orientation is taught early; no causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final tableau of shared brush and new page (“To love is to translate”) reconfigures meaning with felt cost—Lila cedes sole authorship. Causal chain holds: sleepless nights → painting Elena → Mr. Voss recognition → invitation to co-translate. One clean transition (rooftop → dawn) keeps mosaic within bounds. No orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lila commits to revival with visible cost—flour on faces, off-key songs, the beekeeper’s absence. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: pattern of rising warmth against grotto chill reweights the stake. One transition (cottage → pool) is clean; orientation is anchored early.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    Causal lens holds: each attempt (yoyo drop, mercury coil, lighthouse ignition) tightens options under a clear “because/therefore.” Closure lands with visible cost—the island itself shudders, gears reverse, fate’s lock picked. The final image crystallizes a before/after without exposition. One minor ellipsis: how the lighthouse stores light is assumed, not taught.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (“tell the shadow you welcome it”) narrows options until the cloak’s flare dissolves the threat. Closure lands as Decisive Change—shadow gone, clasp re-lit—cost seared into flesh. Orientation is anchored by line 3; no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the driftwood circle’s shift from chaos to mosaic is legible and charged. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each dubbed layer thickens the pattern until the final silence reweights the whole. One causal gap: the seabird’s cry is absorbed too smoothly, a micro-convenience.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.4)
    Causal lens holds: each beat (whistle sequence, crack widening, journal revelation) tightens options until the gate’s purpose flips. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—gate was a cage, not a shield—felt through Lira’s immobility amid collapsing shells. One transition (surface → tunnel) is clean and legible. No causality breaks; cost is unmistakable in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the timeline shift reweights the manifesto’s lie and seeds future reckoning. Causal chain holds—rose death → tunnel → ledger → T-letter—with one clean transition. Cost is legible in the inscription “Truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed.”

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Single-scene structure holds; orientation anchors by line 3. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara’s note reweights “interlaced absence” from theory to lived inheritance. Causal linkage: inkwell → note → discovery → new note threads cleanly. Cost is felt in the lighter inkwell and her shoreline smile.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands cleanly: the vault opens, the journal rewrites the city’s myth, and Lira swims away with both artifact and burden—an Earned Stasis that forecloses denial. Causal chain holds (blackout → spiral map → stamp alignment → revelation), though the blackout’s engineered nature is asserted more than dramatized.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: grief density increases until the lantern’s light reconfigures meaning. Closure lands as Charged Poise—cost is the ongoing tremble and the next shadow. One transition (workshop→garden) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the new crystal pulses, the observatory is gone, and Elara steps into an irreversible role. Causal chain—geode → node → shatter → rebirth—holds without gaps. One micro-turn at the node entry tightens stakes under a Causal lens. Cost is legible in the vanished observatory and the “wild thing” heart.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure is a resonant reconfiguration: the chip unites, but the true key is star-alignment—cost is the open unknown now humming in Lira’s bones. Causal chain holds: track → observe → lever → decode. Orientation is swift; no lens ambiguity.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: Elias renounces false-memory craft, accepting the cost of disclosure. Causal chain—driftwood visions → knowledge → decision—holds under Causal lens. Orientation is swift; no teleporting props. One meaningful tightening: the watch-hand stops trembling when the choice is made.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara’s release of the pull reconfigures meaning and forecloses the path of clinging to past mistakes. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory layer and object recurrence tightens the emotional cadence until the final image. No orientation debt; anchors are clear by line 5. Cost is legible in the vanished pull and Elias’s retained one.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: leaving the compass reweights the premise, and the cost is felt in the final image of paddling south without looking back. Causal chain holds—compass found → lighthouse reached → compass abandoned—though the lighthouse beat could tighten. Orientation is clear by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the lake’s images layer regret until the final Charged Poise (“the journey was enough”). Orientation is swift; closure lands with conceptual cost—she renounces certainty. Causality holds; no teleporting props.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.9)
    Single-scene arc under Accumulative/Textural lens: spice-scent density increases, pattern breaks at climax, closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—bridge-self crystallized with felt cost. Orientation anchored by ~80 words. No causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: the healed saucer and new handprint crystallize a before/after shift from self-punishment to acceptance. Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each card and object layers density until the final image reweights meaning. Cost is legible in the dissolving glade and relinquished cloudbound exile.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal lens inferred and sustained. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—door opens, physics stabilises, Lira floats—but the cost is mostly conceptual: the locket shatters and the Tear is re-absorbed, not lost to Lira. One line—“You did not avoid the shadow, you wore it like a cloak”—ties the beat together. The causality is clean, the turn is on page, yet the reader would have welcomed a tangible price like memory-loss or bodily anchor.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure lands on page with DC/CR hybrid: Lira’s detour yields a literal reconfiguration marked by glowing map. Causal chain (bugs → prophecy → confusion → listening in hush) holds. -0.3 for late-letter insertion that feels shunted.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.8)
    Causal chain is clear: blackout → test → decipher sundial → open cradle; closure lands with a visible shift (lights still out, plans now secured). One minor ellipsis—how Elara “tracked” the blackout sequence—keeps it from 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: the obsidian rock centers a living sigil, reweighting the premise from mastery to witness. Causal chain—Fibonacci → Pascal → Möbius—narrows options until the final stilling of the storm. Cost is visible in the star-dust’s scream and Lira’s tears. Lens is Causal; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the sealed envelope and storm-lit smile reconfigure Kael’s stance from fugitive to defiant poet. Causal chain holds—storm pressure → envelope poem → decision to mail—under an Accumulative/Textural lens. No orientation drift; anchors clear by line 5. Cost is legible in the final image: scars ache in the cold, risk accepted.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the duel pivots from victory to collaborative translation, cost legible in the blood on Kael’s shoulder and the shared silence. Causal linkage holds under an Accumulative/Textural lens; sundial angles and needle holes tighten pattern until meaning reweights.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Cedar’s realization that growth means inhabiting anarchy, not fleeing it, crystallizes in the new poem. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each poem fragment layers density until the final line reweights the premise. Cost is felt in the irreversible shift of identity, though the causal linkage between molting and this insight could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: her encore’s ghosts vibrate while compasses spin wildly, showing she has surprised fate back. Causal chain (film reel → latch → hidden room → playing without strategy) holds under Accumulative/Textural lens; cost is the refusal to repair or re-strategize. Stakes reweighted; no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Lira’s doubt is transmuted into resolve, the ridge’s memory is “safe, for now,” and the monsoon shifts from threat to renewal. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds—each sensory intensification reweights the stake—though the final beat could sharpen the felt cost with one visceral image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.9)
    Situational lens: coherent pressure forces Lira’s stance crystallization. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis where reunion dissolves but inner forgiveness locks in, visible cost in the vanishing ship and sea returned to calm.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with felt cost: symposium rejection crystallizes professional isolation ("some scoffed"), but the chrysalis emergence lacks causal linkage to the final evolution insight, slightly diluting Accumulative lens coherence.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise: the shard’s "In the pauses, the truth breathes" crystallizes her stance with visible cost (abandoning vases for frost-etched panels). Accumulative lens holds perfectly, but the canyon walk transition lacks one beat of physical consequence to deepen the earned stasis.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "silence was not an absence but a presence" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (voice lost, new language gained). Accumulative pressure builds via sensory density (frost, thermal spikes), though the fork’s sudden sound risks coincidence.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: "light erupted—a beam slicing through the water" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (Elias trading shovel for quill); orientation anchored by word 40 with no causality breaks under Hybrid lens.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise: bell's final transformation into communal voice carries undeniable conceptual cost ("dared to name themselves"). Orientation solid by para 1; Accumulative/Textural lens holds through pattern-break from anonymity to named mosaic.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise ("love... waited for the right moment") with legible cost in "peace she had not known since the memory surfaced"; Accumulative lens holds through sensory deepening, though woods transition slightly unanchored at 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing (time as story, not texture) with visible cost in inert fragment and lost visions. Minor causality hiccup: garden's reformation feels slightly convenient without clear constraint from prior disintegration.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Decisive Change lands cleanly: chains snapping during vial-throw reconfigures Lirael from captive to liberator with visible physical cost. Causal lens holds throughout—wall collapse directly enables scavenger threat, which forces the vault solution. Orientation anchors ("rusted iron cuffs," "carnival prize redemption center") by line 10 satisfy the test.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with visible cost ("battered"), but the root addition slightly strains causality as a deus ex machina for trust-breaking sound despite father's notes foreshadowing.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "destiny’s door wasn’t locked. It was a garden" reconfigures stakes with undeniable cost (wilted lily, guard’s obliviousness). Accumulative lens holds—density peaks as the jar "hummed, content to wait."

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise—schematics discovery and sunbeam-aligned bookmark crystallize abandonment’s cost—but the conceptual price ("heart less frozen") feels slightly abstract versus the visceral ice melt; orientation anchors cleanly within 120 words.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with felt cost ("trembling certainty" in final handshake), but enforcer's off-page confession weakens causal chain. Library confrontation tightens options meaningfully despite convenient script-throw resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands (map glowing in darkness), but cost proof fails—no exact line showing sacrifice. Fort’s groans and pebble showers intensify pressure under Accumulative lens, yet shedding gold flakes reads as positive imperfection, not visible cost.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands flawlessly: "Thoughts were not born in isolation..." reweights the courtyard's meaning with undeniable cost in the dissolved violin and altered sweeping rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise: Elias’s silent doodle reconfigures the forecourt’s hush from barrier to bridge, with felt cost in his abandoned logs. Accumulative lens holds as crystal vibrations and ticket markings intensify pressure toward crystallized stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "maze bloomed—not in spite of its wounds, but because of them" crystallizes the cost of embracing flaws. Accumulative lens holds with marbles accumulating meaning, and the orientation test passes by 50 words.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "she reached for the lever again" crystallizes reconfigured stakes with visible cost (sweat, exhaustion). Causal lens holds—each action (pulling lever → destabilization → recalibration) narrows options under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with undeniable conceptual cost: "I'll finish it" forecloses skepticism while accepting the ghost's burden. Accumulative lens holds—water's humming melody deepens pressure until pipe surge forces memorization. Cost legible in drenched clothes and floating program.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "the weight... anchored her" crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds through density increase (smudging, quarantine folder discovery), and auroral sorrow makes cost legible. No orientation debt; lens clarity by midpoint secures high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with undeniable cost in "valve wheel felt heavier now, its beads etched with names." Causal chain tight (valve turn → shaft → truth), though psychic clip feels slightly convenient. Orientation clear by line 1 with tunnel imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands powerfully with keeper's "grip on reality now a faint echo" and smile at stone wall—cost is palpable in relinquished identity; Accumulative/Textural lens holds perfectly as sensory accumulation tightens stakes toward silence.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Mara taking the curl crystallizes stance crystallization with visible cost ("skepticism melted").

    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: vibration through bones makes conceptual cost visceral. Accumulative lens holds as fragmented symbols coalesce into axis shift with irreversible emotional burden.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes stance with conceptual cost ("the flow had begun"); Accumulative lens holds through density shift in letters' revelation. Orientation anchors lighthouse/storm by 50 words; microdot specs drive causality without retroactive patches.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: anchor disintegration exposes assumptions with conceptual cost ("dimensions remain in flux"). Accumulative lens holds through looping density, but escalation lacks meaningful tightening—repetitive rhetorical devices don't narrow options despite "before possession completes" deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("before exhaustion hit" tightening to "it was enough"), though lens ambiguity (Accumulative/Textural) risks cap if not held through final image.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure achieves Charged Poise with conceptual cost (surrendering power for peace), but Accumulative escalation lacks sufficient pressure tightening; timeline shifts feel observational rather than driven by Mara’s agency under duress.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with undeniable cost: "chest ached, not with emptiness but with weight of feeling." Accumulative lens holds via sensory density, but the "days passed" transition slightly softens the climax’s immediacy. Orientation is clear by paragraph one.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis: burning message sacrifices preservation for truth-sharing with visible cost (safety). Causal lens holds—pigeon note triggers clinic visit. Woman's clinic appearance strains causality but doesn't break closure's cost legibility ("shadow long and thin against the wall").

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise: final breath with city smells reconfigures stakes by making grief a conscious act, with felt cost in "tears hot and sudden" earlier. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density shift from lavender triggers to earned acceptance.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure achieves Earned Stasis (Elias continues his work) under Accumulative/Textural lens, but the conceptual cost ("subsume joy") is declared rather than viscerally legible in the final image. The "faint but still present" scent lacks reconfiguration of prior stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: the final "cycle turned anew" crystallizes options with conceptual cost (Clara’s initial blindness to Lila). But the boardinghouse discovery strains causality—Eleanor’s abrupt departure feels convenient, slightly undermining pressure escalation under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.8)
    Causal lens holds perfectly with Earned Stasis closure; the shared "luminescent ache" crystallizes cost through tangible reconfiguration ("thread connecting two hearts"), though the persistent constraint (light refraction mechanics) isn't leveraged enough in tactics to reach 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Lila’s refusal to dismiss her vision ("she’d found the truth") forecloses naive documentation with conceptual cost in the final sketch. Accumulative lens holds via cadence shifts ("time lurched"), and the "borrowed moments" cost is legible in the cooled pendant.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Earned Stasis: Mara’s shift from invisibility to guardianship carries conceptual cost ("no longer invisible") under a coherent Causal lens; city lights steadying while sapphire hush remains crystallizes irreversible change.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost—"Nature wasn’t something to be tamed" crystallizes renunciation. Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds via cadence shifts, but cost proof slightly weakened by "stifling" abstraction despite prior embodied stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: the final image of Marin pocketing the brooch crystallizes her shift from "puzzle-solving" to "listening," with insomnia’s easing as tangible cost under the Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.6)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Elara accepts uncontrollable forces with visceral cost ("throat tighten[ing]"). Pilgrim’s dissolution risks coincidence, but the reconfigured cave song with "unpredictable hum" proves conceptual cost legible under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the trumpet’s resonant note crystallizes mended history with undeniable conceptual cost (exile’s voids transformed), while the Accumulative lens holds through staggered site returns that tighten options toward wholeness.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: the updated map forecloses Elias's old life with "trembling certainty." Hybrid lens (causal progression → accumulative payoff) holds through the hologram shift and ticket exchange, reweighting "fortress" as choice.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with tile's glow and Aelia's presence, but escalation lacks meaningful deepening under Accumulative lens—the whales' song shift feels atmospheric rather than reweighting stakes with sufficient pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.7)
    Causal lens holds tightly: ink tasting enables confrontation, dummy reveal tightens options. Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost (asylum traded for formula), but the agents’ swift capitulation slightly softens stakes escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise fails cost proof test; "enduring magic of time" abstracts conceptual price. Accumulative lens holds but final image lacks undeniable legibility of sacrifice.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure succeeds as Charged Poise when Marcus clutches the locket, crystallizing options with visceral cost ("realization hit like a tidal wave"), though the tide-as-metaphor payoff slightly over-signals the lens shift from Accumulative to Causal.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands cleanly: the final realization reweights the premise with undeniable conceptual cost ("ache in her chest"), under a held Accumulative/Textural lens. Cost proof is explicit in the physical sensation during resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds (Kael stepping away amid revival), but cost of "years of waiting" remains implied rather than visibly dramatized during the townsfolk's instantaneous shift. Lens holds as Accumulative.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly with felt cost (abandoning capture for release), yet storm threat remains abstract pressure rather than tightening tactics—cost legible in "lonesome splendor" final image but escalation lacks causal teeth.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.9)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density intensifies through floral/ink motifs toward Charged Poise closure ("covenant’s weight... in the act of preservation itself"). Cost ("dread that beauty fades") legible but slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: ghost's "loneliness is a language" reweights premise with felt cost in Elias's physical sensation shift ("chest didn't ache").

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=8.3)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds with the resonant tone and softened campus arguments, but the cosmic voice's late arrival after truce resolution creates a causality hiccup—escalation should culminate in the truce beat, not follow it.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=8.6)

    Closure is a Decisive Change: the plant’s transformation crystallizes Elara’s causal choices (pruning = memory reshaping), with undeniable cost in her physical collapse. Lens (Causal) holds perfectly—"because/therefore" linkage tightens options as each cut narrows the plant’s path, and the violet light’s role is motivated by setup.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: "spark—not of electricity, but of something older" crystallizes conceptual cost of wonder's fragility; lens (Accumulative) holds through sensory reweighting.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure lands as a flawless Charged Poise: the houses’ "faint, golden light" crystallizes Lira’s reconfigured understanding of hush as "potential," with irreversible perceptual cost. Accumulative lens holds throughout—the object arrangement’s density increase narrows options until the glow. No causality breaks; the ritual’s escalation is earned by prior object collection.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise succeeds—Mara’s drinking reconfigures the garden’s meaning with conceptual cost—but the "shuddering" effect lacks concrete sensory proof of sacrifice, weakening cost legibility under Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: "texture wasn't to possess—it was the space between" crystallizes cost with conceptual weight; Accumulative lens holds through atmospheric escalation to rupture.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the empty brush and "didn't need to" crystallize earned cost. Accumulative lens holds through sensory density ("saffron quiet" reweighting smog) with no orientation debt.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes displacement/renewal stakes with visible cost (beekeeper's absence) under Accumulative lens; "oven's heat filled the grotto" deepens the dominant stake through sensory density shift without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: path revealed to lighthouse with "bleak exhilaration" crystallizing irreversible change. Causal lens holds—mercury coil directly triggers stone's hunger feedback loop with conceptual cost (world altered) legible in final clock image.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise crystallizes distrust of Vey with felt cost ("The one that survives"), but the conceptual price lacks explicit legibility—ambiguity works yet falls short of undeniable cost proof at the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with visible cost (faded mallet patterns, aching arms), but "chaos into order" reconfiguration lacks visceral felt cost; the drifted orchard's transformation needs sharper stakes consequence in the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=9.3)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands decisively with the gate revelation's conceptual cost, and causal escalation (whistle → crack → journal → shells shifting) holds flawlessly under the Causal lens from midpoint through collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.8)
    Closure as Conceptual Repricing lands with conceptual cost ("truth is not a weapon. It’s a seed"), but Tomas’s sudden appearance violates "coincidence may complicate, not resolve" under Accumulative/Textural lens.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("inkwell felt lighter" signaling emotional release); Accumulative/Textural lens holds via density increase in chamber discovery, reweighting "interlaced absence" with undeniable pressure at the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "truth—raw, unvarnished, and heavy" crystallizes cost. Causal chain holds tightly (blackout→sound→sketch→stamp→vault) with no loopholes. Orientation nailed by line 3.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: "I see you" crystallizes stance against shadow with felt cost (trembling fingers), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Pressure tightens via gem's reflection and shadow's return. Cost proof clear in "dissolved into mist" moment.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=9.0)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara walking away transformed ("no longer a survivor") with undeniable cost (shattered observatory, lost past). Accumulative lens holds through density escalation—"node screamed," "vortex expanded"—reweighting stakes via sensory/emotional intensification without causal breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands powerfully: the hum in Lira's bones and "pull toward the unknown" crystallize irreversible change with visceral cost. Causal lens holds firmly from star alignment to chip assembly, though pilgrim's exposition slightly softens discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=9.1)
    Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through driftwood visions, culminating in Charged Poise closure where "truth too heavy to carry alone" crystallizes stakes with felt cost (watch's coldness); orientation clear by 50 words; cost legible in "noose around his neck" and final "drowning in the sound".

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise: Clara’s release of the pull crystallizes stakes with conceptual cost ("some mistakes meant to be let go"). Situational lens holds—neutral territory’s pressure forces stance crystallization without coincidence. Cost proof is visceral in the vanishing pull and Elias’s mirrored action.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: abandoning the compass ("placed it on the railing") crystallizes stance with visible cost of forsaking safety nets. Accumulative lens holds—regret deepens from direction-finder to tide metaphor, tightening options toward "done hiding." Cost proof undeniable in final image of paddling south without looking back.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost ("carry its weight with grace"), but J.T.'s exposition weakens causality—her sudden appearance and didactic dialogue disrupt Accumulative escalation, making the lake's revelation feel unearned rather than organically deepened.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: phoenix's reappearance crystallizes Lira's transformed state with undeniable cost ("no longer the beast whisperer"). Accumulative lens holds through sensory density; cost proof solid in "she was both human and beast, both alive and dead" with stakes reweighted.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.5)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands flawlessly: the healed saucer crack (question mark to straight line) crystallizes her realization that "repentance is a choice," with visible cost in the glade's dissolution. Accumulative lens holds throughout as sensory density reweights the stake.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands perfectly: the door splitting "with a sigh" reconfigures stakes with conceptual cost (shattered locket, dissolved shadows), under Accumulative/Textural lens. Orientation anchors ship/degradation by paragraph 2, and "long-dried tears" repetition is the sole minor artifact not touching closure.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands cleanly: Lira’s shift from habitual helping to purposeful listening forecloses her “stitching wounds” approach with visible cost (volcano’s quieted rumble, transformed sand). Accumulative/Textural lens holds via hush density buildup, though the stranger’s origin remains unanchored.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.1)
    Closure is valid Charged Poise (descending into cradle), but cost remains implied, not legible. "Blackout won't last" hints at risk but lacks on-page consequence to satisfy cost proof test.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.2)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands with cost ("tears mingling with salt spray") under Accumulative lens; density surge from Fibonacci to Möbius sequences reweights stakes through pattern breaks without causality breaks.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.7)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with conceptual cost: sealing the uncensored poem risks Ministry retaliation, crystallized by "let the storm kiss his wonder." Lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds as storm density intensifies pressure, but "vigil in pause" lacks active operationalization until late.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.4)
    Closure succeeds as Conceptual Repricing ("become the anarchy" reframing resistance), but molting mechanism’s causality remains ambiguous under Accumulative lens despite moon-timed escalation.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure as Charged Poise lands with undeniable conceptual cost: her "surprise fate back" through unplanned music reconfigures the compasses' meaning while the vibrating strings' "ghost of her encore" embodies the irrevocable shift in her relationship with control.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.9)
    Closure lands as Charged Poise with undeniable conceptual cost ("doubt transformed into resolve"), though the dream-cavern transition slightly softens causality under the Accumulative lens.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    Closure as Earned Stasis lands cleanly: Lira’s apology and the ghost’s response crystallize stance with felt cost (erased years), while the calm sea reconfigures the severance myth. Accumulative lens holds—each lace stitch deepens emotional pressure, narrowing options toward forgiveness.
